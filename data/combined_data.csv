With the cost of living here (house, car payments, food, ...) - $150k before taxes a year is sadly not enough to pay our monthly bills.

My question: How do I ""tap"" the annual stock grant (once a year) and keep it available throughout the year? I'm not happy with putting that much money into a savings account (we already have a rainy day fund so a large sum is already not invested). Putting this money into the stock market won't make it readily available if we need to access it.

Do I simply put more into my savings and forget about missed opportunities on the stock market? (I'm a strong believer in ""time in the market beats timing the market"").

Are there better ways to place this additional money that we need access to? Would it be okay to tap the rainy day fund, keep the annual stocks in the stock market (index funds) and then refresh the rainy day fund each time the annual stock vests? 

I'm afraid if I'd be let go a day before the vest, my rainy day fund would be too low and I wouldn't be able to refresh it then.

25,1,"With the ability to automate so many processes and payments, it's easy to get lulled into comfort. The reality of it is that if there is a glitch in the system, you're both responsible for the fallout as well as be your own first responder. Hopefully you have the funds to deal with the fallout, and hopefully you get someone who cares about you when you call the agencies you're involved with.

For example, the app on which I pay my mortgage only allows me to enter an exact amount for monthly payment. But when escrow had gone up and increased my payment due, my payment was considered ""insufficient"" and thus voided altogether. I've just been abroad for several months and wouldn't have been easy to contact. What would have happened if this silliness happened while I've been gone?

Another example, I just got pulled over and was alarmed when the officer informed me that my insurance had been expired since last May.

Married (27) with 2 young kids. We have maxed my 401k (with a 9% match) and both of our Roth IRAs for the last 3 years. Maxed Roth accounts, but no 401k the year before that. We currently have $115,000 in retirement savings and another $50,000 in a taxable account. We currently invest $3,500 a month into retirement accounts, including my company match. We still save an additional $1,500+ a month into taxable accounts on top of this. 

I was running numbers on a compound interest calculator today, and as it stands, if we continue investing $3500 a month into retirement accounts until 35 (8 years) we will have $726,000 in 401k and Roth accounts. This is assuming a 10% return non inflation adjusted. We are invested 100% in S&amp;P 500 ETFs, which have averaged 13% non inflation adjusted the last 10 years. 

We live in a low cost of living part of the country. We grew up here, have decent jobs and don’t plan to move. My thought is - would it be a viable financial plan to knock down contributions to just my company match at 35 and max Roth IRA, so we can allocate the rest of that money towards taxable investments, rental properties etc.? Contributing to company match and maxing Roth accounts alone still puts us at over $2,000 per month going to retirement accounts. 

If we assume the same 10% rate of return referenced above and the 726,000 figure is accurate, we could not put another dime in retirement and at 55 it would be compounded to almost 5 million. Thoughts?",Invest aggressively in retirement while young and switch to other investments mid career?

39,1,"I've had sort of an interesting few years, and don't really have anyone I can look to in my life to ask advice, so thought I'd log back on here and try to crowdsource some myself.

So long story short, after coming out of college at 21, I was planning on joining a regular tech type of job being a BDR or maybe some sort of consulting/banking job. I graduated during covid and the job market seemed a bit weird, then there was this opportunity to help a friend launch a SAAS company during this time. I went for it, and ended up doing pretty well with it, making around $150k/yr during 2021/2022, but somehow not really saving any of it (lost some/spent a lot). 

Additionally, I got lucky with some investments and got my crypto portfolio up to around $3 million somewhere around the beginning of 2022. Since then I have called it quits on the whole crypto thing, and then the SaaS company fell off almost completely, with revenue dying out and the company disbanding. I've started to cash out a good amount of the portfolio am currently sitting in:

60% cash

20% equities 

15% t-bonds @ 4.8%

5% remaining crypto portfolio 


I do anticipate by the end of the year moving some more cash into equities/bonds but am also keeping it in there in the opportunity of purchasing a condo or something like that. 

the total post-tax combined amount of all this by the end of the year should sit around 1.5 million (in CA, not fun but it is what it is) 

0 debt, 0 real estate or any other assets

I've kept expenses quite low during all of this and am currently burning about $5,000 a month, which I would like to reduce because now I feel like I am starting to just burn for no reason. It boils down to 

rent - 2k

car + insurance - 1k 

food/misc - 2k


I've had sort of a mini-retirement over the past year and was seeing where the market would sit but over the past few months I've decided I do not want to work in that industry anymore. It feels weird not having much experience in a larger tech/finance company so I am not sure how the switch would really work, it also is going to be a bit different going from an average 7 figure total income down to 100k, if I can even get that, but I really need to get back to work and keep earning.

I would like to buy a house/condo within the next few years, and maybe even start a family. In CA the amount of money I have made does not seem sufficient enough to just stop working obviously. I think that I need to keep earning and growing a career. The 1.5 million start is a great point, but I really do not know where to go from here. 

The other option I have been thinking about is business school, but I am not sure if I would get into anything that would be worthwhile.

So I guess my overall following questions are 

-How are my investments? At what point am I able to start to look at purchasing a condo/townhouse in the $1-1.5 million range? 

-What career paths should I start to research in my free time and begin to apply to?

-Is business school a viable option in my situation? (coming from a mid-tier school with 3.0gpa, but an interesting story and can probably score high on GMAT)","Unemployed at 24 with a substantial investing portfolio, where to go from here?"

1. So I left my job earlier last year and was unemployed for a few months.

But I looked at the account recently, almost a year later, and I see that there is $400ish in “cash available to trade”. Does that mean that there is $400 sitting there, uninvested?

49,1,"Hello Folks

I am looking to prepare for taxes this year and has I had a few major life milestones. Want to make sure I am prepared properly. Was able to buy my wife and I's first home and my wife gave birth to my beautiful daughter as well.

I have two deduction related questions

The first is that I recently purchased a house as a first time home buyer and am debating if the itemized deduction has value for me. I am going through potential deductions and was looking at deductions for home improvement.

We bought the house last year and as it is a older home, we needed to have some electrical and plumbing work done. The electrical came out to about $6k and the final for the plumbing was about 12k I believe. The electrical was replacing the electrical panel and other wiring to bring it up to code. The plumbing was was a sewer clean out installed and having the sewer pipeline lined for structural stability cause the pipe was installed in the late 60s.

The second is that with my wife having medical expenses from the birth of my daughter these would also be deductions as well. Based on what I am reading anything we paid out of pocket while we were in the hospital, which was a emergency C-Section cause she was born 5 weeks early would count correct. In total that was another 6k in expenses.

These combined with deductions from mortgage related deductions would be quite a bit more than the regular standard deduction of $25k filing married jointly. Am I correct?",Would these be applicable for itemized deductions? (Federal US)

I currently have about $17k in liquid cash, another maybe 5k in watches I can sell relatively easily if I choose to do so. 

My current car is a rebuilt title 2013 g37x that has a couple issues that I could live with but I’ve put it on the market to see what happens, hoping to get 9-10k for it. My credit score whenever I buy would be good/excellent which will prob yield me a 7% rate or so.

If I buy the GV70 I think I’d put down 20-25k and finance the rest.

57,1,"Hi,

Starting this fall, I will be pursuing my PhD for the next 5-6 years. I have a significant amount of money lying around, and I am trying to figure out the best way to invest it.  A rough summary of my accounts can be found below:

\- 18000 in Roth IRA (maxed contribution for 2021, 2022, and 2023) (3 fund portfolio 70% domestic, 20% international, 10% bonds)

\- 15000 in 401k through my job

\- 6000 in series i bonds

\- 20000 in a checking account (my emergency fund \~ 9 months of expenses)

\- 80000 in an account with a wealth management company (\~60000 of which is liquid, 20k in individual stocks)

The main problem I have is that I want to move my money out of the wealth management company due to fees, and I generally don't think its necessary.  However, I'm not sure what the best way to do so is. My thoughts were set aside \~40k to invest annually in my Roth IRA. Would it be better to just invest this money in a taxable account now and just contribute whatever I can from my stipend to my Roth over the next 6 years?

The 20k in individual stocks I was considering selling out right next year when my income is lower (\~33k a year for my stipend vs my current income of \~90k). I would like to put that money in a taxable brokerage account with vanguard and invest in mutual funds in a 3 fund strategy.  

The final 20k I want to leave at least for the next year until I decide whether I want a car for grad school. I currently have a car, but it is 22 years old, and I don't know how much time it has left. If I decide I want a car the entire time, I would leave that 20k as liquid until my current car dies whenever that may be.

Also, I plan to roll my 401k into my Roth Ira on a year where my income is low (so probably the year after I sell off the individual stocks)

I was charged the difference for the ""upgrade"", and paid it without much of a second thought along with my damage deposit. A few days later I was able to return the truck and switch into a midsize vehicle, and all was good.

However, in talking with the at-fault insurance, I mentioned that they had no midsize vehicles available on the first day of the rental period and that I had been charged the difference. I asked if there was any way I could be reimbursed for that, and they told me that it's industry standard for the rental company themselves not to charge the upgrade difference if no vehicles are available in the insurance-authorized size/price class.

Is this correct? I would love to be able to recoup the difference but don't want to sound like an idiot if I speak with anyone with the rental company. TYIA!",Car rental upgrade refund due to lack of availability?
143,1,"So my husband and I suck at our finances. We have very little savings and between all of our credit cards we have roughly $30-40k in debt. We don't have a car loan and I own our house and we have a mortgage on it. We also have a fair amount of student loan debt. 

My plan is to apply for a debt consolidation loan at our local credit union. Our credit card payments are killing us. However, we also need a new roof on our house (it started leaking a few weeks ago 🫠), and we also need to fix portions of our siding and our driveway. So I'm thinking once we get everything squared away, put our credit cards away so we can't use them anymore, then apply for a home equity line of credit to get the house stuff done. 

Is this a bad idea?  Will applying for both so close to each other be a hit on my credit?  My credit is actually pretty good despite our debt because we always pay on time and we don't use all of what's available to us.

1. Michigan Education Trust - my parents, Michigan residents, have offered to open a MET for their grandchild with our additional funds. We live in another state, but we can cross that later.  
2. MET-Lock in current tuition rates for in-state Michigan rates. According to the MET site we could expect a 5.5% Annual Rate of Return on investments (I’m ok with this given the locked in tuition rates). Can anyone confirm this assessment? 
3. Downside, my kid would be limited to Public Michigan Universities (which are great! UofM, MSU, WMU, CMU, EMU) or local public colleges. Or we could apply the funds to private or out of state schools, but the tuition is unknown.

158,1," 

Sorry for the long post but I feel is necessary to explain the situation. Basically, my fiance and I are getting married in September of 2023 and we have begun to book certain vendors. We opened a new chase credit card to take advantage of the expenses and rack up points. We booked a big photography company which basically contracts photographers for the day of the wedding. While we were shortening our picks, this particular company was very responsive and always got back to us in quick fashion. Eventually we decided to book them and they demanded 50% of the total cost (should have been the first red flag) for the package which turned out to be around $1800. We paid it on December 20 of 2022.

The problems began immediately after booking with them. They are now very unresponsive and we have yet to even be able to schedule our initial phone call meeting which layouts our plans for the wedding. Every email takes about a week to respond and their only excuse is that they are super busy right now. We text and call the company and can hardly ever get through anyone. Now my fiance and I are extremely worried that if this persist until our wedding day than we might be stuck with a terrible company and will not be satisfied with the photos and videos.

My fiance brought up the idea of seeing if we can get a refund but their website states that the original deposit is non-refundable. Since we think the company would not want to issue a refund we are thinking of doing a charge back but are scared of how the company might retaliate. Up to this point they have not provided us with any service or product. We have spoken with Chase and they said they can initiate the charge back if we want to go ahead with it. My question is how likely is it that the charge back is successful and what could be the consequences if it isn't? What other options do I have at this point?

My boyfriend and I have sat down to come up with a plan to get me out of debt, I bring in about 2,800 a month, so with rent, car note, insurance &amp; all other necessities I can afford about $300 a month in payments. The problem is that when I make a payment, the interest is so high that the payment hardly does anything. On top of this, I have had crippling anxiety about this debt for months &amp; have not even looked at the accounts until last week. So not only do I have a ton of late payments but I am also waaay over my limits on every single card. What can I do? Can I call the cc companies to explain hardship and possibly get the late payments removed? If I call, can they help me figure out what I can pay that will make a difference?

* 40k in retirement 
* 60k in personal portfolio
* 25k liquid cash
* a full time job making 95k yearly
* a monthly va disability check of approx 3600 (tax free, for life)

The disability check from the va is from numerous things, the biggest being depression which I still suffer from and am currently battling. I live in a VHCOL city, save most of my income and find that I have little to no joy in anything I do. I used to love this city but rent is so out of hand and I feel like I'll never own here so my thought is ""what's the point"" of staying here if 1) it's only going to be temporary - I'll have to eventually move if I ever want to buy or 2) I'll rent forever.

I am considering selling all of my belongings, quitting my job and traveling the world (living as a nomad until I find a place to call home for a while). I've traveled and volunteered all over the globe in the past and found great joy in helping others. Being in the military changed my views on long term accommodations, as I would move every six months (between deployments and trainings) so not having a place to call home for a while shouldn't be too bothersome given I have experience in that arena. With the 3600 I should be able to travel and continue to save and will have the 25k as an emergency cushion if I decide to come back to the states to start over, as well as the retirement and personal portfolios.

Basically the concept of using your money wisely, but it can also apply to other things like time or your own personal energy levels.

It would be stupid to spend $1000 on canned beans for the next 5 years just because they’re on sale (unless you‘re a prepper haha), you’d be better off buying just a few and then taking the rest of that money and using it towards your rent or if you’ve got a business investing in some equipment.

Now this sounds a lot like “opportunity cost,” but to me that just describes what you’re missing out on when you buy one thing instead of another.

What I’ve been interested in lately is the idea of how **the way you use your money** can impact how much buying power it has over the long run.

Maybe similar to the way a new company would “bootstrap” everything together just so they can become profitable. Figuring out a way, even with just the bare essentials, to make things work.

This can be especially helpful for the young adults or teenagers out there who don’t have a lot of money right now because there are ways **you can maximize your moneys power by utilizing in it a specific way, also in a specific order.**

If you had $10,000 you could easily blow through it in one day, or for some people they could manipulate it and allocate it in such a way to turn that money into a million dollar company.

50% - Vanguard Mutual fund
30% - Individual stocks (half blue chip, half riskier investments such as EV)
10% - Crypto (mostly BTC and ETH)
10% - Cash (mostly in an online high yield savings acct)
   
Debt:
My families home that I currently live in is 100% in my name only, as well as the line of credit we took out on the home to redo the back yard. Balances are as follows:

Fixed rate mortgage at 2.9%
Balance is 117k, monthly payment is 1,038/mo including taxes and insurance. Value of the home is around 550k. 

0 student loans or credit card debt

My car is a lease. 

The line of credit we took out was for $100k, but we have only pulled 30k out of it. The rate we signed was variable: currently at 8%. The monkey payment on that is about $200/ month. 

Again, both of these loans are completely under my name, with no co-signer, although I do not actually make the payments myself. The only payments I make is the $500/ mo directly to my parents. They send me the money for the mortgage and line of credit monthly. 

My end goal is to buy myself a condo.  As of this moment all my investments / cash is worth around $85k. Keeping in mind this time last year it was worth around $140k. Yes 2022 was a painful year. Overall I’m about even / up a little on my investments.

and how much do I get paid? base salary is $500 dollars, if I don't achieve my target for a specific month im screwed and I cant even have enough money to last until the next month, everything is so depressing, some of my co-workers are getting paid twice as me because they are ""older"" or ""more experienced"" while I work as twice as them, in 2022 I got an award cuz I brought more customers than any other employee.. with 70% unemployment rate in my country there is no way I can find another job, I try every single day, I apply for multiple jobs in my city and even online, I even tried to work as a freelancer.. I work as a Marketing and Sales Officer at a small digital services in Palestine.. I'm tired and depressed. 

I cant imagine myself being at a better place in the next 3 years, I found this job by a miracle, I don't have enough money to get out of this city or to do anything really. I had a chance at crypto once where I made a lot of money but I didn't sell because I'm a naive idiot who never got paid more than $12,000 A YEAR 

I don't have enough money to start my own business, my boss always tells me he'll give me a raise later when the company is making more money, he's been telling me this for the past 3 years now, I considered quitting many times, I actually did it once and couldn't find any other job so I ended up getting back to my work in 45 days.... a baby is coming and im scared that I won't be able to give him the best life, I cant keep borrowing money from my mom or dad, its unhealthy for me.. in a country with no future, safety or money.. what can I possibly do? how can I organize myself if I don't even get enough money to live like a human-being?

183,1,"So I am aware that a Roth IRA can only receive taxable income, but it seems like if one’s teenager has a job, that you could establish an arrangement with him that you will match any contributions he makes to a Roth IRA with a gift of spending money deposited into his checking account. Just getting $10,000 or so invested by the time he’s 18 would go a long way to getting him set up for retirement, and if you can find pretext to pay him another $10,000 over that time (like for yard work or something—fully reported to the IRS and appropriate taxes paid), then, according to my calculation, he could pretty easily have a million dollar retirement fund off of that investment alone.

My wife wants to setup a 529 for them, but I think I just want to put their money into a standard index fund with Vanguard (which is where I have my Roth IRA). When I was a baby, my grandmother setup a trust fund for me this way and while it was annoying reporting it on my taxes (been several years now... what is it, a 1099-DIV?) and I had to report it as income when I cashed out to use it, I was appreciative of the fact that I could use it for whatever I wanted.

It wasn't a ton of money. My grandma started it with like $500 in 1986, never contributed to it, and by 2016 when we took the money out, it was about $6,000 I think. We ended up using it as a down payment on our house. Without it, we probably would still be renting.

We will not be able to contribute much to their funds. We use YNAB for budgeting and right now each kid gets $20 per month. They're young enough that we put their birthday money into this fund too. Each grandparent also contributed some to get it started. The 5 year old has about $4500 set aside and the 3 year old has about $3600 set aside currently.

224,1,"Saw another post here recently mentioning the benefits of Roth IRA over Roth 401(k), specifically the no penalty on withdrawals. My understanding is that any *contributions* to the Roth IRA can be made at any time without penalty, but any *gains* must wait five years after account opening (or first contribution) to be withdrawn penalty free.

So my situation is this: I have about $5400 current balance in my Roth 401(k). Because of the stock market performance over the past year, my gains are only about $100 more than my total contributions to the account ($5300 or so). Because of the flexibility afforded to withdrawals from Roth IRAs, I am considering transferring this balance into a Roth IRA in the event of an emergency in the near future (I don't currently have an emergency fund though I intend to build one up this year to cover). If I were to transfer, it would be into a new IRA, so the five year clock would start then and there.

Question: If transferred today, would the total $5400 be considered one big contribution to the IRA? Or would my current 401(k) account manager notate somehow to the IRA account manager how much of that lump contribution is comprised of gains? Obviously if I absolutely had to make a withdrawal I would only do so with the contribution portion so as to avoid any penalties.

244,1,"Two years ago, I bought a used 2015 VW GTI Autobahn with around 70k miles. Last week, I had to take it to a mechanic because of an issue with the engine. The shop is well known in the area and is pretty reputable. Anyway, they told me that the engine needs to be replaced.

Obviously there is no warranty on the car. So the total cost of repair will be around 7-10k, depending on the mileage on the swapped engine (engines are usually from scrapyards, used parts stores, etc). For example, engines with 80k+ miles will go for around 3-4k while low mileage ones will go for 5k+. The cost of the labor is 4.5k before tax assuming there are no other complications. 

Sadly, this engine failure has come up after only two years with a total of 10k miles driven. But, given my light usage, I think I can get by without a car since I work remotely and can use public city transportation if needed. Finally, there is around 10k left on my car loan.

I have thought out a couple options

1. Fix and keep the car. There is some unknowable amount of risk from a used engine and possibly other parts failing. 
2. Fix and sell the car in the near future. Kelly blue book valued my car at 11-14k for a private sale. Probably less if I sold it to a dealership. I would try to keep repair costs close to 7-8k if I decide to do this.
3. Sell my car for scrap. I've seen people on marketplace and Craigslist selling totaled cars for a 1-2k.
4. Donate car. Nonprofit will try to sell my damaged car and I can deduct some amount from the sale from my income. 

I'm leaning toward donating my car. Fixing and selling sounded good to me at first, but there's a bit of risk of not making up the total repair cost, i.e I suspect the total repair cost will be closer to 8-9k even for a lower cost engine. Option 3 sounds too much of a hassle to make it worth it for me. Furthermore, if I decide to fix the car, I think I'd convince myself to keep it.

It sucks that I'd have to donate after such a short time of owning it. This is my first car, and it is in otherwise great condition. Not having a car would make it difficult for me to take my dog to the park, go hiking/skiing/etc., and get around the city freely. But I think that has to be the right choice? I can afford to fix my car but it is still quite a bit of money for me.",Should I fix or donate car?

246,1,"Hi, I'm 25 years old who works as an engineer and I make about 160k a year. I'm considering maxing out my 401k. I've read a ton of different comments on reddit but I'm still not sure which one I should do.

For Roth IRA, I'm going to stick with mega backdoor because I may be promoted later this year and there will be bonus and raise. If that happens my income is likely going to be over the Roth IRA limit, and I don't want to deal with this later this year.

So, I calculated that my tax advantage is around 7.5k when contributing to Traditional 401k. Given that, what would be the better option for me in a long term?

1. Tradition 401k ($22,500) + Mega backdoor Roth IRA ($7,500)

262,1,"Ello, im in New York. 

I have a trust paying for half of my education and living expenses. (Rent and tuition.) Current rent is $900 and I’m considering moving into $1150 shortly. 

In a few months the trust loses this structure and I simply get the money. I think we’re looking at a bit less that 100k. 

My income from my part time job ranges between $2000 and $4000 a month. (I travel a lot and hence take lots of time off and I go to school. So income is volatile.) I have no debt. 

I’m just trying to figure out what I should do here, the way I see it I’ve got two choices:

Keep living this way. Use the money to continue paying half education and rent expense. Do this until my income is reliable enough to stop using that money and then put the rest away. 

Or, stop living this way. Lock it all up (ETFs probably, right?) for retirement and cut my expenses drastically. Lower happiness factor but higher security factor.

I have one more year of state University left so tuition still to be paid is maybe ~12k. 

I also drive a beater and am entertaining the idea of buying the cheapest new car i can. Just to stop having to worry about reliability.

I am an engineer with a lot of practical experience so I do most house projects myself, I do recognize my limits.

Our Financial Advisor has been pretty indifferent (Can you afford your bills? Yes. Do you Spend more than you make? No. Are you making retirement contributions? Yes.) Then you are doing fine.

I want to do more than fine, but I am not sure where to start looking deeper.

&amp;#x200B;

* About Us: Me M(32) \~$80K/year base pay w/ base 10% bonus, wife F(28) \~$45K/year working as a contractor, soon to be interviewing for full-time. YAY!
* Location: ""Medium"" cost of living in the Midwest
* Net worth \~$365K 
* Monthly Net $6200
* Traditional 401(k) Me: 11% employer match up-to 6% 1: .50, Roth 4%, Wife: 401(k) 12%, not sure about employer match off the top of my head.
   * Current balance for me $121K (Last year took a big hit), also only seven years in the workforce due to grad school.
   * Unsure of wife's balance, I would guess \~$35K-40K (I know I should ask, but she is flakey talking about it, has had few different employers, and she doesn't have the accounts consolidated yet, one of the goals for 2023): 5 years in the workforce.
* Normal Brokerage account: $80K, had been contributing $1500/month until the wife was laid off, plan to restart at $1000/month as our traditional 401(k) contributions are going to be stepping up.
* Checking: $5K, we try not to keep a lot sitting here
* Credit Union savings with my employer credit union: $2k, I contribute $150 each paycheck, this our short-term goal money. We used a lot of it for a trip to the UK last year.
* Emergency fund: $40K (this is skewed): it is actually $20K the other $20K is from a student loan refund as we paid it off before the Government Forgiveness attempt. We are cautiously hopeful but have it earmarked in case it doesn't happen.
* HSA: $14k; we are maxing this every year, just started 2 years ago from a PPO plan
* Pension: I, fortunately, have a cash balance pension with my employer; current estimates show it to be worth \~$600K at my retirement. When we talk with out Financial advisor, we do not include this as I do not want to bank on it.
* Retirement: We are both okay with working until 65; we enjoy what we do enough, the pay and benefits are good, and we get enough PTO to take the trips we want to take. 
* Mandatory Expenses:
   * Mortgage/taxes/insurance: $1500 required, we pay $925 biweekly = \~$2000/month over 26 payments a year. I plan to increase every year by $25, achieving a payoff date of March 2032, I can confirm all the extra goes to the principal. If I hold at $925 biweekly, the payoff date is October 2033 and saves $22K in interest compared to conventional monthly payments. $750 biweekly saves $11k in interest over the course of the loan with a maturity date of Oct 2037. 
      * Mortgage Details: Balance: $176K owed @ 2.75% 
   * Utilities, Cellphone, Car Insurance (2 cars): \~$650
   * No vehicle debt
   * No CC debt
   * Monthly Spending for Food, gas, groceries, going out, small projects, and ""stuff"" typically comes to $2K a month for the two of us. Are we spending too much here? We like to have fun but I don't think we are frivolous, maybe we are. How much could we realistically reduce this by?

I feel like we run a little tight on margins, but that helps keep us conscientious and we talk pretty regularly about our day-to-day finances.

I am open to input on recommendations of what we can do better. I can hear the voices now, ""Defined budget""

I am very curious as to the opinions on the level at which we are overpaying on the mortgage. Is it really worth it?  $175 invested monthly @ 6% over 4 years = $8K&lt;$11K interest saved, but $3k really isn't that much, and 4 years really isn't that long in the grand scheme.",How are we doing?

279,1,"I’m just a little bit confused. I recently got my Paypal Mastercard a month ago. Last month my husband and I happened to have a fall back financially. We we were lucky enough to have my Mastercard for emergency use. We used 75% of the allowance. The first payment was this month. I thought it was the 27th but I was mistake because the due date with 7th. They charged me the late fee. I paid that and then it wouldn’t let me make any additional payments. 

Anyways, after I made the payment today. That’s when I noticed that it was showing deactivated. I called PayPal and they said my Master Card is very much still active because I still have an available balance. They don’t know why it’s showing deactivated on my end.

281,1,"I recently switched jobs to a new employer. Both my previous employer and my current employer are EU-based Big Pharma companies. My previous employer offered a cash balance pension plan, in additional to the usual 401(k) retirement benefit. A cash balance pension is a defined-contribution pension plan (as opposed to ""traditional"" pensions which are defined-benefit)

I've already done a rollover of the 401(k) from previous employer to a Vanguard rollover IRA that I use as the landing spot for my 401(k) whenever I leave a job. That rollover IRA only contains pre-tax dollars; I have a separate Roth IRA with after-tax contributions.

That leaves the Cash Balance Pension plan - the current balance is \~$45K, and if I leave it in place it will continue to grow at a rate equivalent to the 24-month average of 30-year Treasury Bonds (currently \~3.6% i think?) until I reach retirement age at which point it converts to an annuity. there are a bunch of different annuity options about which I won't go into in detail here based on how I want to structure the annuity benefit for myself and my wife as my survivor.

From reading the plan docs I believe I can do a direct lump sum rollover of this balance into my rollover IRA without paying any tax on the money. My initial thinking is that it make sense to do this, because I can expect to beat the pension growth rate over time with a fairly straightforward index ETF based investing approach. I'm just not sure if the math pencils out once you factor in the annuity conversion - I think it does but want to be sure I'm not missing something obvious.

Some context:  


* I'm 45-years-old, married with 2 kids
* My investment philosophy is mostly Bogle-ish except I don't park any money in bonds - so i'm typically 80/20 US / International broad market index ETFs. This applies to my retirement accounts and my personal brokerage account
* Salary in the mid-200's, total comp in the high-300's factoring annual bonus + share grants. max my 401(k) contributions every year and park the rest of my savings in a personal brokerage account (plus the kids' 529's)

on top of everything else, that cash balance pension is parked with some random benefits administrator company (Alight?) which I have no other reason to have a continuing relationship with - and I just don't like the idea of having to keep track of that website/account for the next 25 years until i'm ready to cash out. by contrast my current (new) employer uses Fidelity to manage its 401(k) plan. I know it's trivial compared to the dollars and cents, but assuming the math works out this would be one more reason to move the money over to my Vanguard rollover IRA.

TIA!",Should I rollover my Cash Balance Pension?
282,1,"A buddy of mine from years ago reached out about a new financial service he provides at his firm - permanent life insurance. He is trying to sell me on it as a sort of “hidden” retirement savings account. I’m skeptical about the merits of the whole thing. 

Basically, the way he described it, I should reduce my (generous) 401k match and contribute the difference to this PLI policy. From what he said, the policy works like an investment - and it’s different from a 401k in the sense that I could tap into it really whenever I needed it without paying the 401k early withdrawal penalties. From what I gather, this is partially true - but his trying to sell it as some sort of tax-haven savings account really rubbed me wrong. 

My company offers an insanely good 401k. I don’t remember the numbers off hand, but it’s 100% match up to (I think) 5% and 75% up to 5% of my salary thereafter). I contribute the max. I’m fully vested. He reviewed my pay stubs and was trying to tell me that I would come out ahead cutting my 401k contributions and sending the rest to PLI. His rationale centered around the (supposed) fact that I could pull from the PLI easier and cheaper than my 401k. 

I save outside of this too. I’m 25, no kids, no dependents, single dude. My employer has term life as well as short and long term disability already. I have both. I’ve never come up short on cash. I want to buy a house eventually but I have a separate savings for that already. 

I just don’t see how what he’s selling isn’t some kind of snake oil. Am I missing anything, or is my inclination to continue maxing out my matches 401k a smarter long term play?",Permanent Life Insurance - Worth it
283,1,"I've been offered a position to work for a company that is contracted by a large tech firm. I have the option to start either as a 1099 or W-2. 1099 would be $45 an hour and W-2 would be $40.25, and the reason why I am stuck on which is the better deal is that there is close to 10k on the line.

I used an online calculator which said W-2 would result in a higher net income but this doesn't consider tax advantages that are available to 1099. From what I've read, I can expense work-related purchases and can be eligible for a QBI deduction. Realistically, I won't be expensing much but the QBI deduction for a potential 20% off is appealing.

285,1,"Suppose A, B and C together set up a shared fund named ABC Fund. ABC Fund has 10.000 USD, in which:

* A's stake is 2000 USD (20%)
* B's stake is 4800 USD (48%)
* C's stake is 3200 USD (32%)

In a certain month, they need to rent a cloud server for 3900 USD. After paying, the fund has 6100 USD left.

There are two possible methods for splitting expenses:

# 1. Ratio method

An expense is split by **ratio of each member's stake**.

For example, in this case, stake of each member is deducted as follow:

* A: $3900 x 20% = $780. His remaining stake is 1220 USD.
* B: $3900 x 48% = $1872. His remaining stake is 2928 USD.
* C: $3900 x 32% = $1248. His remaining stake is 1952 USD.

In the end, the ratio of stake between 3 members is still the *same*.

# 2. Equal division method

An expense is divided by the **number of contributing members**. Each equal part will be deducted from each member's stake.

In the example above, the cost is 3900 USD and there are 3 members, so it will be divided into 3 parts of 1300 USD each.

Remaining stake and ratio between them and total fund are derived as follow:

* A: $2000 - $1300 = 700 USD (11,5%)
* B: $4800 - $1300 = 3500 USD (57,4%)
* C: $3200 - $1300 = 1900 USD (31,1%)

The ratio of stake has relatively *changed*.

Please note that, contributions to ABC Fund is non-permanent i.e. **refundable**. Each member reserves the right to withdraw his stake at anytime.",I've come up with two possible methods for splitting expenses in a shared fund. Which one do you think is better? Please share your thoughts

* We currently share a car (Prius) and found out that the wheel bearing needs to be replaced. We are driving this car into the ground and it just reached 250k miles. We might be replacing it if there are more problems that might show up. 
* We have about $1k coming up for legal fees for her marriage.

The silver lining is we have $8k coming towards us from my wife's savings, but we really need some of that for a down payment on a new car (we might have to buy two). Every time I seem to get my finances in order, there is some expense that wipes it away. I am putting $1k per month into a 401k account and would like to start a Roth IRA soon. I also put $800 into my savings every month from emergencies. I have tried saving money on groceries, cutting out subscriptions, and not eating out. 

I feel like I am doing everything I need to do to avoid debt and build a decent savings account, but there is always something completely stochastic that wipes all of it away.

Is there anything else I can do to avoid having these costs? I feel like I will never build a decent savings with all of these hurdles.",I am having trouble managing things that I cannot control

318,1,"I'm so sorry this is long. A lot has happened. I just turned 31 and I work from home as a medical biller. I've racked up a lot of credit card debt and have been hit with a lot of financial problems these past few months and now my credit score is bad and I'm spending a lot of time panicking. I'm trying to make things right now and not dig myself in an even worse hole.

To be honest, I've always been pretty impulsive with my credit card spending (not an excuse but if it helps as a reason I was diagnosed with adhd  a couple years ago and my spending was horrendous and almost nonstop before medication and therapy), but I always paid my bills on time and never maxed my cards out. A few months ago, my car (a 2010 Mazda if needed) had the check engine light come and and it was close to $1000 to fix everything, then a few days later, my older dog was having accidents inside, and took her to the vet, she was diagnosed with diabetes and that appointment was $300 and her insulin is about $60 for the smallest of vials and it's $105 for the medicated food she needs. A couple weeks later is was about another $200 for the vet to do a glucose curve, and then it was $300 for more repairs on my car to pass inspection.

I didn't have a lot of savings, but used so much of it, I only have $12 left. I maxed out my cards either to pay for gas, groceries, or another vial of insulin after not planning and anticipating when I'd need a new one. Was late on paying some cards a few times and my bank account has been negative more than once these past few months. Outside of that, my other bills are rent, insurance, internet, my phone bill, and power bill. I've gotten rid of my non needed subscriptions, and haven't seen a doctor in months, but what are some good tools to help budget so everything is getting paid? What can I do to save money so I have more to pay bills? Coupons at the store? Is it too late to fix my finances?

I'm paid biweekly and don't think I need a second job, but is that something I should seriously consider? Any advice will help. I can share more details if needed. Thank you so much.

To avoid the pro-rata rule, I need to roll over all my pre-tax funds into my current employer's 401k. which is Guideline.

Unbeknownst to me, the car had recently had an engine replacement (shop wasn't an authorized shop voiding dealer warranty and used an ebay engine they won't cover since I wasn't the owner at that time) . The car only had roughly 22k miles on it. The listing price of the car was 38k, and I financed 33k after down payment and trade. Car was sold as is no warranty so I purchased an optional dealer warranty. Long story short, after owning the car for 23 days, the engine failed (cracked block). The failure caused oil to dump on the exhaust, which in turn caused an engine bay fire. I've spent the last couple of months attempting to get somebody to cover the repairs between warranty and insurance. Insurance reluctantly agreed to only cover $1200 of the total repair cost ($13,300). After having the car towed everywhere, I'm ready to throw in the towel. I've been borrowing a car to drive, which is inconvenient. It would take me a little over a year to save the money to repair the car. I'm at the point where I'm ready to call the bank and return the car as a voluntary repossession. I feel this would allow me to negotiate a much lower payment on the remaining balance after auction. Without my current payment ($675/month) I feel I would be able to recover much quicker even if I had to buy a car for just a couple grand to start. I'm not worried about the credit impact because I have made the decision that I am DONE borrowing money. If I can't buy it cash I don't need it (except my house). Is this rational or reckless?

About $55k is Credit Cards, $57k personal loans, $22k student loans, $7 in auto loans. Right now everything is maxed. the personal loans were great for consolidation but we screwed up and filled the cards again.

Would love your thoughts below on what I have learned so far. Please correct me on anything thats wrong. Please also let me know of other things that I should do research into to learn! thank you!

1. growth focused mutual funds/index funds/ETF: managed funds in specific sectors or stocks focused on stock growth. Best in a bullshit market with decreased risk due to diversification. Things to consider are specific focus of funds, expense ratio (cost), and past performance. gold standard here is S&amp;P500 index fund (go to index fund, high performance, low expense ratio)

2. Dividend focused mutual funds/index funds/ETF: managed funds specifically focused on dividends growth and reinvestment along with stock growth. Steady growth that is more resistant to bear markets as dividends can offset some of the decrease in stock performance. Specific things to look for are stock dividends focused vs. stock growth focused, expense ratio, past performance. the gold standard here is SCHD (proven record, large diversification, yields on growth and dividend)

3. Treasury bonds/I bonds: money loaned to the government and other entities with a promise of return after a certain time period. This is a very safe investment that is a cash equivalent that protects your money from inflation while keeping it liquid. It has the lowest grow rate out of most types of investing but makes up for it in liquidity and safety. If you need money for upcoming large purchases, you want to invest in bonds for quick liquidation and safety. gold standard is US treasury bond (backed by us government, 4.8% interest on 26 weeks bond, can sell early if necessary for liquidity)",rate my understanding for types of investing

394,1,"Notice all of the quotations. 

I just graduated with a PhD in mathematics and got my first big girl job in San Diego. I went to school in Mississippi and used Sallie Mae as a way to get through school while only having to work 1 job (although sometimes 2 when I had the time). When I say I used Sallie Mae… I mean I would take out a couple thousand dollars more in student loans than needed to also help out with rent and bills. I’m sure I’m not the first to do this, but I obviously regret it now. At the same time, there’s no way I would’ve been able to work 2-3 jobs while in school for 7 years pursuing a doctorate. I mean.. I guess I could’ve.. but no. 

Anyways, by the time graduation rolled around, I had two credit cards on top of my $50k in student loans (MS is cheeeaaap). One credit card is one I’ve had since I was 16 and I got it for myself to use for gas money. Obviously it’s been used for other things since then lol. The other card is one a financial professional at my bank signed me up for to use the 0% APR promo to pay off as much of my student loans as I could in a year. About two months after having this new credit card, my kitty cat, my SON, was hospitalized for 2 nights with a urinary blockage. A couple weeks later I found out I got the job in San Diego (I was living in New Orleans at the time) and needed to relocate.  My company helped out a little bit, but needless to say, I now had two maxed out credit cards. I did a balance transfer from my original card to another 0% APR card, and now I’m looking at 2 maxed out credit cards and 1 about 75% paid off (the LOC on the new promo card was less than the balance on my original card). But, for now, I’m only paying interest on one card, and the one with the smallest balance. 

I’m spending about $1200 a month trying to pay off these cards before the promos end. Plus $540 a month on my student loans. I’m also adjusting to living in one of the most expensive cities in America with about $1000 a month leftover for groceries, gas, and my “wants”. Totally doable, fine. Now for the part that will make you cringe:

A friend of mine is a “credit repair specialist” - his dad is too so it’s a family thing I guess. Now keep in mind, my credit score isn’t terrible (roughly 650 due to utilization), and I have no delinquencies. He suggested I STOP paying off my card(s), LET my credit card(s) go delinquent, and then dispute to the collectors that the debts aren’t mine. He’s POSITIVE that he could get a card or two off my report completely within a year. Well, we got into a huge argument and he told me that I just don’t understand how debt collections work. Now, I’m not letting anyone play The Sims on my credit report, but this cannot be a thing that people do, right? It sounds absolutely ass-backwards to me for a CREDIT REPAIR SPECIALIST to suggest going delinquent on purpose… any one ever heard of this “strategy” before? Or is it just called scummy fraud?

Also, guess who needs all new tires after that hell of a drive! I guess I’ll be staying on that “college diet” haha WHY IS CALIFORNIA SO EXPENSIVE

395,1,"I'll try to make a long story as short as possible. About 5 years ago I purchased a device from a Verizon store with an associated data plan. Two weeks later I returned the device and cancelled the data plan. I was told by the Verizon store employee everything was 100% taken care of and I owed nothing.

Three years later and I pull my credit to find Verizon was claiming I owed them $54 for this service. I called Verizon customer support, explained the situation, and they assured me it was their mistake. They took the claim off my credit and I was told everything was 100% cancelled.

This is where I messed up: I didn't get any of this in writing. Only verbally over the phone (and in-store before).

I'm a 26 year old trying to dip his toes into a three fund portfolio. I have settled on:

* 64% VTI Total Stock Market ETF
* 16% VXUS Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund
* 20% BND Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF

Now I've read the bogleheads article ([https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient\_fund\_placement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement)) and I can't seem to wrap my head around how this may apply to my three fund portfolio.

Which I guess would look something like this:

* VTI would be in a Roth IRA first and then into a taxable account
* VXUS would be in a taxable account for possible foreign tax credit
* BND would be in a traditional IRA or 401(k) first and then into a Roth IRA

416,1,"Ok, so this is going to be a bit of an explanation and I'm sure I'll get chastised for procrastinating on it.

I have an IRA that I've been contributing to for a few years (it's not a significant portion of my retirement savings though).  The problem is that for those years I've not been able to reclaim the taxes for the money I put into it because I've been above the max income level to get the tax deduction.

I've since created a Roth IRA and started putting the money there instead so that I'm not making the issue worse, but I still have a good chunk of money from several years of maxing out the traditional IRA that I need to roll into the roth IRA.  My problem is that when I report on rolling over to the roth IRA it's going to want to make me pay taxes on the amounts, but that doesn't make sense because I never got the tax discounts in the first place.

So, my question is two part:

1. Is there anything special that I need to do when I do the rollover (I use fidelity if that counts for anything) to avoid paying taxes twice
1. Is there any guidance anyone here can give on how to navigate the tax forms (I use turbotax but would use a different app or do it manually if needed...though manual would be painful) so that I can file my taxes correctly to note the rollover without incurring duplicate taxes?

note:  I asked two different financial advisers from fidelity, neither knew the answer.  One didn't know the difference between a traditional IRA and a roth IRA.  The other seemed more knowledgeable but wasn't sure on the specifics other than I'd have to pay taxes on any gains from the rollover....but he didn't seem to know the details on how to file.",How to roll over IRA into Roth IRA without penalty when taxes haven't been withheld

We bought our starter home in 2016 for $285k and the current value is $385k.
Current mortgage is a 30-year fixed at 3.5% (refinanced in 2020).
Current mortgage balance is approximately $225k.
Only other outstanding debt is a car payment and a debt consolidation loan, totaling $1325/month.
We have $45,000 in a savings account.
Our combined salary is $220k/year.
We've spoken with a builder in our area and were told to plan spending approximately $300/sqft based on the level of finishes we want.
Our budget for the next house is $900k (including the lot).

437,1,"TL;DR: Happy with my job, not my pay. Expressed my salary concerns to my boss, and I'm currently slated for a 12% raise next month. Got an offer for almost 30% more with another company, but benefits are worse and cost of living is higher. What would you do next?

Okay, I'll try to cover everything. I am a scientific professional in the civil engineering consulting industry. I was unhappy with my annual raise in 2022, so I set out to see if I could get paid more somewhere else, or at least get an offer that would give me some leverage to get a larger raise in my current position this year. I've received and offer and am hoping to get some advice on my situation.

I currently work in Cincinnati. I was hired two years ago in 2021 for an entry-level level field-based position with an engineering consulting company at an annual salary of $56,000 USD. I went into my current position with about a year of combined experience in the form of an internship that I did before grad school and a consulting job that I landed after finishing my Masters degree. I was laid off from that consulting job in 2020 and ended up working in a grocery store for about another year. The entry-level position I was hired for in 2021 did not require a Masters degree at all, and since I had been working in retail and struggling to find work, I pounced on the offer, even though $56k wasn't a lot.

I excelled in my job and quickly became viewed as a reliably key contributor on my team. I was slightly overqualified compared to a typical worker in that role, and combined with the year of experience I already had, I rapidly began to take on responsibilities beyond what was typical for an entry-level employee on the team, but still wholly within the scope of an individual contributor. In Spring of 2022, at the end of my first annual review cycle, I received a promotion from a Level 1 to Level 2 staff member. This is the level into which early career professionals are typically hired who are a bit beyond being considered entry-level, but are not typically being assigned any direct reports or given the responsibility of managing a team. Along with my promotion I received a ~7% raise, and I had to fight for it. Initially they offered ~5.5%. The raise I received brought my salary up to almost exactly $60,000 USD annually. Typically annual raises at my company for employees who are performing but not receiving a promotion are 3%. At the time, the 12-month inflation rate was right above about 8%. I wasn't happy. I resolved to try to find a better paying job, or to at least get something in writing that I could use for my next annual review cycle to try to leverage a larger raise than I expected they would give me otherwise.

In late 2022, I called a meeting with my boss and my branch manager. I expressed to them that I was unhappy with the raise I received earlier that year. I explained how I expect my salary to increase at a rate that outpaces inflation, and the fact that I didn't obtain that even with receiving a promotion was a red flag for me, that I considered it a step backwards, and that I wasn't okay with that. I stated very clearly that I was very worried about taking another step backwards with my annual raise in Spring 2023 since inflation rates were still in the 6% to 7% range, and that if that was the case, I'd be worried that I would no longer be able to afford to work with them.

At the time, I'd been interviewing with another company who was attempting to recruit me after I'd been referred to them by an third party. They were interested in me moving to a very high cost of living city on the east coast. I told them I'd be very interested if their offer made financial sense. That was mostly a lie. I felt like I would hate working with the branch manager I had interviewed with. Nevertheless, I made it seem like I was very interested so that they would give me something in writing, and it seemed likely they would make me an offer, which is one of the reasons I decided to have a meeting to express my salary concerns to my superiors. Ironically, they gave me written offer the same day I had that meeting, just a few hours later in the day.

Their offer was about 22% higher than my $60k salary. Their wasn't nearly enough to justify moving, especially since they are a smaller company and their benefits package is significantly less valuable that my current employer's. They had asked how much I wanted, and I evaded the question by basically telling them I wasn't sure how much it would take to make it worth it, just that I expected something commensurate with the responsibilities of the role and that reflected the cost of living difference between the two cities. As a follow up, they asked me how much my current salary was. I told them, but I inflated it by ~20%.

As a result, their offer represented an incredibly marginal increase to what they thought I was already making. I wasn't excited at all. I responded to their offer letting them know that unfortunately it didn't make financial sense, but that I'd be willing to consider further offers if they had room in their budget in order to reflect the increased cost of living. I reminded them that I currently liked my job and was in overall positive work environment (which was true) in an attempt to imply to them that they needed to make it worth my while.

They responded by increasing their offer to a salary that equates to a ~27% raise from my current salary, so just a few thousand dollars more annually. More important, they offered me a choice of moving to Atlanta instead. Atlanta seems to be still more expensive than Cincinnati, but not nearly as much as the alternative. I told them I wanted to meet the folks in Atlanta. That process in ongoing. So far, I like them way better than the first office. I told my boss I wanted to continue my salary discussions from last year. I told him I'd received an offer in writing from another company for a significant pay raise, and I wanted to know what sort of raise I could expect at the conclusion of the review cycle in Spring 2023. He told me they had me down for a 12% raise. I have not yet asked for that in writing, but in the event I turn down my prospective employer, I plan to request their promised raise in writing before rejecting the offer on the table. I told him 12% was more than I feared I would get, but that the number I was really looking for was 16% to 18%.

So my choice is between ~$67,000 annually in Cincinnati (assuming their 12% is true) and ~$76,000 annually in Atlanta. Here's the catch. The benefits where I'm at are better. I get fluctuating work week (Chinese) overtime at my current job, but no overtime at the new job. Retirement match is currently 4% compared to 3% at the new job. Per Diem rates are ~20% higher at the current job. Healthcare costs are significantly less at my current job. I currently get almost $1000 / year extra to pay for my cell phone because I use it for work.

The biggest difference, though, is that I currently am able to commute in a company vehicle. My wife and I share one car. I've been given implicit permission to commute in my field vehicle. If not for this, I'd have to buy a car and insure it. They even pay for the gas I put in it to commute. This was not an explicit part of the job offer, though. My wife was rear-ended during my first year with this company, and the car was totaled. When I was discussing the logistical problems I was having in before replacing her car, two of my supervisors independently suggested commuting in the company car I routinely use. Neither specified whether this was intended to be a short-term or long-term solution, but for about a year now I've been doing this. Nobody has expressed any concern. It's been great.

I just found out there's no guarantee this will continue. My division has ~20 employees companywide, but I was only one of two in my local office when I was hired, so I was basically working on a two-man team day-to-day. Our team had two vehicles, so we each had our own. We just hired a third team member, and at the same time one of our division's vehicles is being re-appropriated to another team in a different office. This will leave one vehicle for three team members. We will have the option to borrow vehicles from other divisions that operate in our branch, though, and there are plenty of those. While I'll likely be able to commute regularly for the next month or two, later in the year when the new teammate gets up to speed, it seems like the this gravy train may very well come to an end.

So that's where I'm at. Currently my plan is to counter-offer my prospective employer with a salary that would make it actually worth considering. Ideally, I'd like to give them a number that they aren't able to actually meet, but close enough that they increase their current offer, then take their new offer to my current employer to see if they are willing to increase my 12% raise. I'm worried that the actual number that would make me want to leave is just too high and was result in them digging in their heels, but at the same time I don't want to burn bridges by giving them a number that isn't actually quite good enough for me to accept, have them agree, then reject the offer.

My wife and I got married in April 2022. With the wedding, honeymoon, moving states (to Ohio - a non community property state) and unexpected medical bills, we got into about $20,000 worth of credit card debt. The credit card is only in my name as she is not on the card. This is all debt we accrued together though, not just me. I paid it off every month until wedding season hit and we used this card in particular aspirin other two cards max out at $1,500 and we don’t really use them.

She had a trust set up by a family member and we have added to it together since before we were married. We are trying to buy a house soon and want this debt cleared so we sold shares from her account that is now sitting in her bank account.

We will be filing jointly and we are in the process of adding me to that account. We also understand we will have to pay capital gains taxes on the shares sold. 

However, to put it simply, we are confused on how to transfer money from her account to pay off my credit without having to pay additional tax on a gift tax. We view this as our trust now and we view it as our debt. Not hers nor mine.

Does a gift tax apply here? Does my income increase due to this? If so, does it cancel out if she writes it off? Do I need to add her to this card first and she just pays it off? Can we just pay off that card using her account if her name isn’t on it?

474,1,"Hey all,

I was looking for some advice on managing your CC spending. I am in a much better position financially than I was say, 5 years ago (I'm 36 now). I've been living on my own for about 10 years now, and bought a house in the city I live in this last year.

I'm not concerned about my budget per say, but I guess I'm just looking for some advice with the direction I'm headed in.

When I first struck out on my own (left a LTR when I was 26), I relied heavily on credit cards to make ends meet. I have always had two jobs however, so I've been able to pay more than the minimum on them each month, if not clear them entirely. The most CC debt I've ever had was about 16k, and over the last few years I managed to get that down to the lowest in my adult life at 10k. I also used do a lot of research with balance transfer savings, and would take advantage of consolidating CC debt when I could just to have some extra money for the year. My goal is to avoid that in the future.

As everyone knows, these past few months have been tight with price increases and such, and I've realized I've begun relying on my CCs more than usual again. Currently, I have three credit cards with balances on them:

Fidelity (16.99%) - $1700 \[I've used this for everyday purchases so I could get points, then I pay it off entirely each month, or as close as I can\]

Chase ($24.99) - $1000 \[this is a relatively new one from Amazon that I used to purchase some home appliance/furniture when I first moved in. Ideally, I'll clear this next month and not use it again unless I need to buy something large off Amazon with an interest deal of some kind\]

Discover (0% until Jan 2024; 24.99% after that) - $8800 \[this is a CC consolidation I did a few months ago; I've been paying it off at $900/month)

Other than that I have:

Checkings: $3500

Savings: $7200 \[I deposit $100/week\]

401K: $5000 \[I meet my company's match\]

Trad IRA: $28200 

Roth IRA: $10700 \[I contribute $150/month for the time being, down from $500/year. The thinking being I want to really tackle my CC debt.

I've begun to realize that I 'rely' on my CC for everyday purchases like food, gas or groceries. So a couple of questions:

1) Does it make sense to continue using CCs and gaining points if I'm also able to juggle reducing my overall debt?

2) Would it make sense to pull from my savings and pay off a large chunk of my current CC debt, at my interest rates?

100% of contributions were to the State Street Equity 500 Index Fund Class K, with an expense ratio reported to be 0.02%

Every month, I seem to be assessed the following fee: “Fees - Allocation.” This occurred both in the months with contributions and the subsequent months where I was already maxed and no longer worked at the company. This is just some kind of general account fee. 

Depending on the month, the fee is around $56-61, of a total balance around the $20,500 contributed, depending on market value. It looks to be just about 0.003 or 3/10th of a percent.

484,1,"Hello everyone,

I hope you guys are doing well! Happy new year. I thought I would put some information out into the world of reddit and see what kind of advice/information I can get back. Any kind of input would be much appreciated!  


I have a friend who moved to the US with his family from the Czech Republic over 15 years ago; his parents somehow qualified for citizenship a long time ago and my friend (their son) never got his, despite being a minor at the time. He does have DACA for now.

So, given that he has DACA and is self-employed through a landscaping business that his parents handed down to him (after they filed bankruptcy), he has been managing this business now for almost 8 years. He has a total of 3-5 clients that are very wealthy and hire him to care for their properties,  maintenance things around the house, and do personal work for them. 

He also struggles to get health insurance that isn't $750/month through a private plan. He he struggles to understand how to manage his taxes as a self-employed person under DACA. He has a lot of expenses with his business and also hires other immigrants to help out with some work in which he pays them in cash.  


The clients he is working for are offering him a salary instead of broken up payments of random work he does. Can he somehow get insurance through them if he gets paid salary?  


Is there a way to get him affordable healthcare?  


Any advice on managing a self-employed landscaping business such as organizing paperwork, what processes to follow, how to deal with things when tax season comes, etc...?

490,1,"I opened a credit card a few months back and decided to start using it for daily purchases and paying it off multiple times a month to avoid interest, but still get the benefits of the card. 

I realized fairly quickly that it was difficult to keep up with my spendable balance since my banking app doesn't always show my true balance due to pending transactions and my credit card app is the same, so subtracting the balance owed on my CC from my checking balance was never completely accurate and I was occasionally overspending. I downloaded a very simple check register-esque app to track my daily spending to keep a running balance of how much spendable money I have available. I get paid monthly (on the first), so I set all of my monthly auto-draft expenses (car, bills, subscriptions, etc) to come out on the third of the month in case my paycheck hits on a weird day due to weekends, holidays, etc., and I manually enter each transaction as I make them (sometimes I have to backtrack, but never to the point of going zero). This ensures that even if my expenses don't actually get taken from my checking on the first-third, my app shows my spendable balance sans all expenses so I know there will always be enough money to cover all auto-drafts out of my checking. 

I try to pull excels of my CC account, checking account, and tracking app on a semi-regular basis to reconcile, and had everything matched to the penny back in mid-September, but now I have an outage somewhere that I CANNOT find at all and I can't seem to reconcile it to zero. I have no formulas going or anything, I just highlight the matching transaction and color code based on where the money came out (i.e. my CC or my checking account). I know this is probably the longest and least effective way to track everything, but I am not sure what else to do or how to find my outage and balance out again. 

Any advice on formulas, reconciling tips, etc., would be so helpful because at this point I am at my wits end. I have thought about getting Mint, but I don't know if that shows a running balance for spendable cash or if it is mainly used for budgeting?

Immediately hooked me up to a fraud specialist line, told me the balance would be processed and then taken off/compensated whatever, simple. Week or so later on Jan 3 apparently the balance of $80 was added back to my account, thought maybe that was it being added onto it, and it'll take a couple days, but no it was added BACK and under the transactions it said the claim was closed. Didn't know if that meant denied or not so I called them again and they redirected me to some other line and she told me it was denied because something about the physical chip was indeed scanned there? like yea? no shit? It wasn't me, and I've never even used that card anywhere ever.

The lady told me she reopened the case, and it'll take 45 business days to investigate, I'm guessing all while the balance is sitting there past the billing cycle? I'm tight as fuck on money rn.

Even that was relatively brief - “Just buy 65% of this and 35% of this”.

Tens of thousands of people have been laid off in the past few months with some getting a decent severance package but many not getting any compensation at all. If you have less than 10000 in your savings you can find yourself in hot water very quickly. Do not underestimate how quickly a few $1000 in your savings account can disappear when you have no income revenue coming in. Understand that unemployment is not nearly as much as many people believe it is and many times it can take 1 to 2 months to receive any money at all.  Don't go to the unemployment office, go straight to a temp agency close to you and see what jobs they have available. A lot of people don't even realize they exist but just Google temp agency near me and you'll see that they're pretty much in every city in town in the United States. They can often get you a job THE NEXT DAY. This is especially important for people that have no savings.  You would be lucky to get $300 a week in unemployment and like I said you won't get that for at least a month. You need to start making money immediately to stop the bleed. Once you've secured that job you need to immediately sit down and calculate what your weekly paycheck will look like and see what your entire financial standing is going to be.

Should I stop contributing to my Roth IRA and put that toward my student loans and let the Pension and TSP work on retirement savings? Additonal context below.

I've now had a pension at 3 of my last 4 jobs (including the job I just started). However, I didn't reach the vesting period for any of them. 

The contributions to Job 1 (pension) left me with $1,200 invested (spent 3 years there). 

Because I was young, naive, (and also more focused on my student loans), I was ONLY contributing to the pension, not considering that I wouldn't be vested if I left the job (which I did after things went south during the pandemic). 

Job 2 had a 401k, I spent a year there and invested about $10k

The contributions for Job 3 (pension) total about $2k. 

Job 4 has a pension (10 years to be vested, mandatory 1% salary contribution). They also have a TSP in which I'll contribute 5% (max) of my salary and they will contribute 2.5%.

Since the start of Job 3 (June '22), I have been investing about $450/month into a Roth IRA.

I don’t have a computer for freelance work and my portfolio is super rough right now. I work in UX, design, animation and social media content strategy so I need a decent laptop. I’m a mid-level worker with experience at the big 5 tech giants and startups.

My flights have already been paid for. My Airbnbs are half paid for through early February and I can’t get my money back for cancelling early. I also have expenses back home (storage unit, car payment, pet care, other bills, etc.). My remaining expenses are about $5000.

I do not have an apartment to go back to in the US.

528,1,"So the pandemics been a bit rough for me. Was working as a freelancer and it wiped out my business, been hanging on the last couple years finding other freelance work, downsizing home and barely skating by. Things are looking up though as I just landed a big contract and hoping that this is a big year for me so I can get back on track. Here's my situation:  


I'm probably going to be making around 50-70k in the next three months. Trying to figure out best way to catch up on things and spend it. The 2nd half of the year I'd imagine I'd be making at least another 50-70k on top of it as long as business stay's normal which I imagine it would. I'm also looking for a salary remote job so ensure I have decent income the 2nd half of the year in case thins slow down. Our total household budget is normally around $7k/month.

Debt:

10k in student loan, been doing $100/month for a while to keep it from defaulting which is has in the past.

5k in credit cards

7k in a hospital bill from last year cause I was uninsured at the time.

A whooper 65K in back tax from years ago, accrued a ton of fees/interest and now trying to get it under 50k so I can cut a deal with IRS and shrink down the amount owed. I had a payment plan but it lapsed a few months ago when my income went way down. I'll probably work out another payment plan with them for $1000/month, but I'm assuming maybe I'll hold off this til end of year or next year to work out a deal paying off larger sum  


And then the big factor I'm trying to figure out is that me and my wife both need new cars. Mine has been paid off for a while but it's at 220k miles and is just hanging on. Our family car has like $500 left on the loan so will be paid off in two more months. But we've been sinking around $3k+ every year into in for repairs and the whole thing is literally falling apart and so much is corroding that I don't imagine it's worth spending another 4k-7k this year fixing it.   


Any recommendations on best way to proceed? I'm leaning towards maybe spending 20k downpayment on the cars (10k for each) to secure a decent loan. And then get the debt back on track with month payments with the hope to start paying bigger chunks on them at end of year or beginning of next year after I get more consistent income.",Advice sorting out expenses

530,1,"Hey guys,

I’ve been reading a lot of posts and the articles they’ve cited but I would feel better knowing that what I’ve found directly applies to my current situation so I apologize if this has been asked hundreds of times but I prefer to err on the safe side :)

Currently, I have two credit cards; My first credit card that has a limit of $1,000 and my second credit card that has a limit of $7,500. My first credit card was a student credit card and I never bothered to increase my credit card limit on that as it was more than enough at the time. My second credit card started off with $2,500 then they offered my $7,500 and because I was told that remaining under 30% is ideal, I went for it. 

My current credit score is 823 out of 900 and my 2nd credit card has offered me another increase to $15,500. This is obviously more than enough and I am certain that my monthly spending will likely total to around 6% utilization. I do plan on getting more credit cards in the future to maximize any benefits or rewards plans while making sure to have at least 1 monthly payment on each card. Will increasing my limit to $15,500 affect my credit score poorly especially when I gain more credit cards in the future as my utilization will start to approach 1% or is this ideal?

My partner is not really pumped to move since they have lived here their whole life, their parents are nearby which is helpful when we go away for a weekend and can have them dog-sit. They are an introvert and think that moving to a new city would make it difficult to make new friends.

About 3 months later decided I wanted to cancel the warranties. No issue - dealership issued a check for the prorated amount of $6,750 to the lien holder on the vehicle. A month goes by but the lienholder still hasn’t reflected the refund.

587,1,"Hey all. So a little context here first. 

My fiancée and I met in college. After college we moved away to get away from her physically and financially abusive mother. Her mother is awful with money and has a big “credit cards are free money” complex that keeps them poor. 

So her mom took out 160k of parent plus loans (in addition to the 25k in my fiancées name that we’ve paid off) This was never discussed and my fiancée was just told “it’s being taken care of”. She was too lazy to fill out the FAFSA and instead took out loans for the entire balance. She then sprung it on us that we’d be expected to pay 1/2 of the loans upon graduation. I believe the monthly payment as of now is around $1000. 

We’re saving for a house, so we cannot really afford to be throwing away that much each month. (Like wanting to buy one within the next year. We’ve been living with my parents to save for going on 3 years) My other concern is her mother is known for making dumb financial choices to pay for things she doesn’t need. (Constant balance transfers. Multiple home equity loans). I’m concerned these loans were partially used to subsidize her spending and not fully used for school. Is there any way to confirm this ? 

The incomes we are working with are: 

Her Parents : About 60k a year 
Us: About 140k a year 

If it were up to me, I’d let them drown. It was their mistake and was never agreed to throughout school. However, my fiancée is worried that if we do that they’ll take it out on her sister who still lives with them. 

From what I can see, Parent Plus loans are eligible for IBR repayment plans which caps it at like 10% of discretionary income. Since their income is so much lower than ours, do you think this is the best plan going forward ?",Would it make sense for my MIL to go on IBR for Parent Plus loans?

590,1,"My boyfriend and I, both mid 30s, have a decision to make of who moves where. I feel like there are pros and cons for all available options and I'm not sure what is the best route to take.

Current situation: My boyfriend lives in Chicago and is in federal law enforcement. His current salary is $80k but he will work his way up to $140k in about five years. He cannot leave Chicago for another 4 years in this current role. I live in a low cost of living city with total compensation of $160k a year. I am geographically limited on where I can work because I have a PhD in a niche field. The cost of living calculator shows Chicago is 30% more expensive than where I life. We want to be together. 

CHICAGO OPTION: My boyfriend stays in his current job. He makes $80k a year this year and I take a job making $115k. Total compensation between us is $195k immediately. Based on salary ranges from the lab I'd be working for, I expect in 5 years I'd be making $130k and he'd make $140k. Total compensation is $270k. Downside is my career, giving up being a lead researcher to support staff since there's nothing in the area that's in my area of research.

LOWER COL OPTION: I stay at my current job at $160k a year. He takes a job at the local police department making $70k a year. Total compensation is $230k. In 5 years, I anticipate my total compensation would be around $175k a year, but his would be capped out at $70k. Total between us would be $245k.

Background: I currently have two credit cards and am carrying a balance of ~7k on each. Thankfully, I recently got a new job with a much higher salary, and I can finally afford to pay down this toxic debt. I’m planning to pay it down pretty aggressively and have calculated I can erase it all in 15-18 months (as it stands right now including interest). 

Both cards have recently offered balance transfer promos with low APRs (card A is 0.99% for 15 mos, card B is 0% for 9 mos). Card A has a credit limit of 23000, card B has 10000. 

My idea is… could I transfer the entire 7k balance of card B to card A, then do a second transfer back to card B, essentially swapping their balances but capturing both new promo rates for a nice period of very low interest??

It’s my understanding that, by law, CC companies have to apply any payment over the minimum to higher APR balances, so the whole plan hinges on the second balance transfer “payment” going to the higher APR debt and not just wiping out the first transfer. Would this indeed be the case, or am I getting my hopes up?

 I wrecked and rebuilt my credit over the past 10 years. From 800 to 500-something and back again to 770/780 now.  But my husband has AWFUL credit and a defaulted/garnished student loan (paused now, but will start again sooner or later.) Part of what helped me rebuild was my mother adding me as an authorized user on her Chase card but not really using it on my end except for like 2 emergencies that were paid back within 3 months each time. I never had any defaulted/garnished things though. 


 If I add my husband to help him start rebuilding and everything stays current/paid down or off, what happens to me because of his garnishment? Anything? We file taxes married but separate because otherwise I'd be tied to his debt but is this the same?

 He's MUCH better with money now but this is following him and making getting his own card (other than secured) to build his own independently difficult.

626,1,"Throwaway account because its embarrassing...was compelled to post tonight after being denied on two balance transfer card applications to try and get my shit together. This is gonna be long as I'm overwhelmed and in word vomit mode, forgive me, and skip to the end for the TLDR if you'd like.

I (M/29) feel silly typing all this out, but I guess sharing the context makes me feel a little better about not having completely fucked off and knowing I've been working my ass off and trying to make things work. 

Like many others in this sub, I fell into the trap of credit cards in early college and then balance transfer cards to keep afloat while being a broke college student. I don't come from money, so I had to take out student loans as well as work all through college. Got an art degree, but there were no real job opportunities in my city, so I moved to NYC to pursue art and music. Freelancing actually seemed doable after getting a taste of a $600/day for a gig but that was short lived and COVID fucked up any real momentum and getting acclimated. I was able to save money after having to leave the city during lockdown while working remotely and managed to pay off most of my debt. Came back to the city to finish what I started and that debt quickly built back up. 

I quit my not so lucrative but ""stable"" retail job ($50k/year) to take a month off to record an album, got back into the service industry, was stoked on my workplace and making like $60k/year only to get laid off due to COVID spikes last winter. Cue unemployment (with benefits, thankfully) for 6 months to try to give myself the time to actually find something worthwhile. Got the opportunity to work a dream job, but of course it doesn't pay for shit. Been working there for a little over 6 months for the sake of the connections and experience, but coming to terms now with the fact that I'm scraping $700/week on a 1099....that's like $36k a year before tax. Fully unsustainable in NYC. I picked up a second gig at a bar and was working 6 days a week for the past two months to make some extra money, but it wasn't nearly as lucrative as expected. Now it's the new year and I'm burned out and have no interest in grinding myself to death, for the sake of recovering from exhaustion i barely want to work 4 days a week. I could go back into working in a bar full time but I'm really, really sick of working til 2am and getting home at 3:30am or later, along with trying to avoid the casual alcoholism that people tend to slip into in the service industry.

I finally got an ADHD diagnosis and am trying to get a handle on my life as crippling debt really doesn't mesh well with anxiety, ADHD paralysis and a brain that's moving at a million miles an hour, all the time. Makes it real hard to get your shit together. So here we are. 

Let's get to the fun bits;

\-No savings account (lmao imagine that)

\-living paycheck to paycheck $700/week

\-my cut of rent is $975/month

\-no clue what my expenses are at this moment, brain is too fried from working so much and I haven't done a full grocery run since November as I full on haven't had the time or energy.

\-$23k in credit card debt, just realized I paid close to $900 in minimum payments/clearing over limit balances this past week across 7 accounts (jesus, that hits different typed out)

\-$23k in student loan debt (hoping $20k of that gets dropped if they pass that loan forgiveness bill that was frozen)

\-The only other thing on the table is like $1500 in a 401k that's probably never gonna go anywhere

Over the years, I've managed to amass a number of tools/assets (instruments, music equipment, cameras) that are valuable and will either continue to hold value or become more valuable. Currently that number sits somewhere around \~$27k. When shit has gotten real bad financially in the past, I've turned to selling off things that I feel okay with parting with to get me through the rough patch. Unfortunately I'm currently in a position where I don't have anything I actively want to give up as I've sort of narrowed it down to a bunch of high quality stuff that I got for cheap enough and it's all stuff that I actually use - by no means is it a ""collection"" or ""portfolio"" that is collecting dust. 

I've been hesitant to sell it all off because most of these things are unique and mean something to me and bring something to the table as tools. Also, if I sell it all, I'll have nothing left and starting over sounds like a fucking nightmare, especially in a world where everything is more inflated than usual and replacing these things down the line will cost me even more. This is getting into sort irrational/emotional lines of thinking but I digress.

What do I do at this point? I feel like the obvious answers are going to be ""you're an idiot, get a better job"" and ""sell all your shit and start over"", but I really truly love my job (despite the horrible pay) and I really would rather not sell all my shit as I kind of need it. Maybe a couple things to try and take a chunk out of the debt but it's gonna be hard to do. I've been considering a personal loan but from what I've read, the snowball method might be a better idea. How about bankruptcy? Not like anyone I know my age is gonna be able to afford a house anytime soon, and I don't need a car, who needs good credit lmao

628,1,"Hi all. I applied for a credit card last night but was declined because after putting that I am unemployed, I also put my yearly income was $0 because I thought it was asking about salary from a job, which I don't have.

The rejection letter stated that the reason for the rejection was because my income wasn't high enough to cover the credit, which of course sounds obvious.

So I'm wondering, if I do receive some form of money per year which can still be considered income, just not a salary from a job, should I reapply with that new information? Will it hurt to apply again so quickly? I'm guessing that if I were to put in that information, I would probably be approved, unless the previous rejection has some effect on the second application.

Hello all,

So let me explain the situation first. I have been somewhat over zealous with spending and before I knew it I am now in my overdraft by -£2900 of a 3500 limit.

I bank with Lloyds and at present i am being charged nearly £3 a day for being in it.

I earn £2385 monthly and my outgoings are around 1800 with Mortgage bills etc.(I also need to clear £450 Credit card and about £900 PayPal credit)  
I have a bonus coming around £1000 in March/April time -

My dilemma is this should I do a balance transfer to clear the overdraft get everything in order ( I have an offer for one £4000 over 28 months 0% interest ); doing this would mean every month hypothetically with me being more stern and keeping an eye on spending whilst building a very comfortable savings/safety blanket of money . This will clear the OD and the Credit card leaving me to focus on PayPal Credit in a matter of 3-4 months then finishing off the balance transfer over the next 28 months.

Alternatively I can try and go through some grit , do some overtime and it'll be cleared in a longer time frame - what worries me is when we need to remortgage at end of the year - I do not want to be still in this overdraft . That and if my car fails or my partners needs repairs or anything goes wrong with house it'll be an even dire situation !   
My Fiancé wants to Elope in October just to add a little pressure, I want to rectify this so she can have her dream.

As for what I could sell I have some pop vinyl's and Pokémon cards its whether they of any significant value though. 

I am cutting takeaways and am only using the car when needed amongst other things like cancelling subscriptions and choosing cheaper alternatives on groceries. 

I am beyond ashamed and embarrassed but I wanted to ask here before being trigger happy on clicking on the apply for a balance transfer . I understand whatever happens after this I need to get my head screwed on and really focus on finances more - this is a very hard lesson being learned.

All advice is appreciated - and if you got this far thank you for reading","Overdraft - Balance Transfer, Graft or Other options?"

658,1,"Hello PF! I (26M) am planning on moving to Chicago near the West Loop area and am running the budget on some places to look at. After a long hunting process I have narrowed it down to a place that has a rent of 2800 a month (including utilities). Let me break down my monthly budget:

I am a consultant so after taxes I take home around 6000-7000 USD a month, a little more sometimes if I work longer hours. 
I will take 6000 as the base limit and consider everything else above as added to my 401K. 

Rent - 2800 (2599 + 165 Utilities includes water, gas, cable and internet)

Electricity - 50

Groceries - 400 (Estimate for 1 person) 

Phone - 70

Car - 420 (Lease - I am keeping this car at my dads place in MI as I do not want to pay for parking and will have no use for a car, still will pay as it is my own car)

Auto Insurance - 110 

Loan - 500 (Pay my dad 500 a month for an Apt we own)

Credit Debt - 165 (0% Interest Loan that is 50% paid off ~1000 left)

Savings: 1200 Total
Roth IRA - 575
401K - 625

That leaves around 285 of ""fun"" money which is not much, however I did take a conservative base of 6000. If I end up taking more than 6000 in the month then that money could be used towards more savings or blown on alcohol and weed, granted it is not much more.

Is this a bad idea? This would be my first time living on my own while paying for everything myself. I have lived alone but never handled the financial stuff. I believe the rent is worth it and I do want to live in the downtown area and understand that is just the cost. Are there any hidden costs I am not thinking of maybe as a first time renter?

662,1,"Basic Information

I am 22, turning 23 this spring. I have a bachelors degree and I'm currently working in the Aviation industry.

Income + Existing Contributions

I currently net about $3,300 per month, rounding to $1650 per paycheck. I currently contribute 5% to my Roth 401(k), as I do not get a match my first year of employment. Once I hit one year of service at the company, if I contribute 9% I get a 6% match which is what I plan on doing. I also have an existing Roth IRA, which is not funded yet.

Expenses

I currently live at home with my parents (rent-free) and I pay off my credit cards in full each month which amount to around $600-700 each month. My car is also paid off.

Debts

As previously stated, I don't carry any credit card debt, auto, or any other debt other than student loans.

Currently my student loans are as follows:

$32,220.12 @ 4.40% - Federal DoE Unsubsidized Loan

$63,661.64 @ 5.22% - Private Loan

The Federal Loan is not currently accruing interest nor are payments due, however, the private loan carries a minimum payment every month of around $730. I currently pay $2000 a month just to accelerate the payoff due to the large balance.

Savings and Emergency Fund

I currently have around $7,500 in a savings account as an emergency fund. I know this is relatively low but it can easily cover six months of my expenses.

Questions

What is the best course of action? I would like to be debt-free, but also fund my retirement accounts and possibly save for a house so I can move out of my parents house. I am very fortunate for the situation I am in, as my expenses are minimal. I know that tomorrow is not promised but my earning potential is astronomical, as I should be making 110K+ at the beginning of 2024. I just feel lost as to where I should put my money.

666,1,"Scenario - Contributed to both for 5 years. One spouse had the HSA the other the FSA. They didn’t know this wasn’t allowed. 

How to reconcile on tax return? 

All contributions to the HSA were excess contributions since they we never an eligible person for contributing. 

They used most of the funds all 5 years towards medical expenses. 

I know all contributions are taxable - in the year they were made? So those years need to be amended to reflect this? 

Excise tax - what constitutes a withdrawal of excess in those years? Does using it towards medical expenses count as a withdrawal in this scenario? If the entire contribution amount was used on medical expenses - does that mean no excise tax would be owed in that year since the entire amount contributed was used towards medical? Or if only a portion was used toward medical expenses, is the amount that was left in the account at the end of the year the only amount that the 6% excise tax would apply? Or are they required to apply it to the entire amount contributed?

Are the distributions for medical expenses still considered qualified distributions? If not - does this mean they would owe the 20% earth distribution penalty on those distributions for each tax year they occurred?

707,1,"Hey friends,

I'm looking for some resources (ideally audio or video format) for my mom who is recently retired but almost completely financially illiterate.

She's extremely bad with money and isn't very forthcoming telling me her details (out of embarrassment and/or pride). 

What I know is that she had somewhere between 20-30k in cc debt. She recently got a low interest personal loan to pay this off (around 3%). She claims she has an emergency fund (""more than I need."") I don't know if this is real or not but I suppose I have to believe her. 

She did mention that she still has one credit card with leftover debt so the loan wasn't enough to cover ALL of it. 

For income she has social security and a pension from an old job, but won't tell me how much. Unsure about 401ks or IRAs. She still owes about 60k on her house and 13k on her car. Almost positive she has no investments

I know she's interested in doing better because I've been staying with her through the holidays and listening to financial podcasts, videos and audiobooks and she's listened in and asked me to pause so she can hear it. So I'm hoping to find something to watch / listen to specifically on budgeting for retirees just to get her brain going. 

But almost everything I find online is about planning for retirement and not a lot of content for folks who are already retired but without much equity. 

Anything would help. She won't read a book but she'll piggy back off anything I watch or listen to so I figure to maximize this while I'm here.

709,1,"I'm in my 50s, shooting for early retirement, maybe 60, not sure.  I have 8x salary saved.  Most if it is in traditional 401k, with half as much in Roth IRA and about half that much in muni bonds in a brokerage account.  

I was thinking about changing my contributions for my remaining working years to Roth 401k to try and increase my after tax funds.  But I'm second guessing that.  It will be hard for me to contribute the max (30k with catchup) if it's after tax funds.  I'm currently at the lower end of the 24% tax bracket.  

Since most of my non-retirement account assets are after tax and that's what I'd be living on for a while, my taxable income will plummet after retirement. Would I not be better off continuing to put as much as possible into traditional 401, and then after retirement when my taxable income drops, gradually start reclassifying the traditional 401k funds into Roth and paying off the taxes at a lower rate?   My goal would be to be convert enough of it, so that for the remaining years I can pull slowly pull from the remaining tax infested funds without also triggering taxes on my SS checks.  I haven't decided yet in what year I'll file for SS.

What I'm unclear of is the process and restrictions of doing a Traditional to Roth conversion.  When I've seen retirement planners speak about this on youtube they seem to recommend to people that they roll over their entire account at once.  Given that some of these people have huge 401ks this would result in a huge taxable windfall.  Is it not possible to say rollover 50k/year starting the year after you retire  so your magi is all taxed at the 12% rate or is it really all or nothing?

I am here to seek some financial advise regarding what to pay off, and even if I should, using the money I have saved up.

I make $43,000 annually pre-tax at my primary job. I DoorDash on the weekends, earning about $200-$300/week.

I currently have $10K in savings. I have three credit cards with the following balances and interest rates: Wells Fargo, $8K, 22.4%; Chase, $1,800, 26%; Synchrony, $1,900, no interest until Dec. 2023. Student loan debt is $10K. I'm using the snowball method to pay these balances off.

I am planning on purchasing a house with my fiance in the latter half of the year.

Would it be worth to cut down on my debt now and build that back up later via primary job and DoorDash? Or should I hang on to it for that down payment on the home and continue the snowball method (my fiance will also be contributing to the down payment, so I won't exhaust all of the funds)? My first inclination was to pay off the Chase card outright and start chipping away at the other two; primarily the balance that is lower and interest free.

My dilemma is that there are a handful of not totally necessary purchases I'd like to make, like revamping the bathrooms. I have the funds to cover this in cash with a bit extra for wiggle room. This is separate from the emergency fund, retirement, or anything else because of the year end bonus that has already been paid out.

730,1,"My fiancee has been dealing with a debt collector today who has been hounding her about repayment of a medical bill, which she paid in full in 2019. She provided them months ago with itemized receipts and insurance charge statements, showing that she owed a little over $100 for her ER visit (she has an itemized receipt from the hospital and insurance cost share receipt). The total cost of treatment was around $1800, but she was insured and was responsible for the balance of \~$100. She promptly paid that balance in 2019 and thought that was the end of it.

The debt collector first reached out to her in July 2022(!) about a delinquent debt of $900 stemming from the same hospital visit in 2019. They sent her an ""itemized"" statement that said little more than she owed \~$900. They claimed that during her ER visit, she may have met with a doctor who operates externally, but sometimes works at the hospital where she received treatment, and this was billed separately (she has no memory of this, and did not receive specialized treatment by a physician, just fluids, etc. from nurses). Is it possible that she was billed separately by this other doctor, who may or may not have been in-network for her insurance? And if so, is the debt and associated collection effort legitimate, considering she never once received an emailed bill from this ""external"" doctor?

I have one medical collection on my card, which I do plan on paying off first, but after that I am unsure what the best option would be.

My credit score is 637, which needs some work, so I do not wish to lower it even more by paying loans off too quick.

I can honestly do better on my budgeting, as I do not have a ton of money in savings currently, but this is mainly due to me overspending on un-needed expenses, but between my current monthly income, not including the extra $400, and my current bills/loans, I come out with about $800 a month in profit, not including my SO's income. 

Does anyone have some insight on what my best route would be for this extra $400?

So I jointly own a vehicle with my(former) friend. I know I’m an idiot. Crazy thing is that I’ve always been a logical person but I was blind to the kind of person she is for the longest time. 

Anyways, we’re in Arizona, its co-ownership with each of us having equal rights to the vehicle as well as equal financial responsibility. Checked with the DMV and the loan is an OR. I’m the primary on the loan as I have good credit and I am the first person they reach out for any reason. I’ve received now 5 repossession notices from the bank as she’s been 2-3 months behind each time but has been able to get caught up, after I harrass her mom into getting her to pay or her mom may be paying not sure. The bank said out of these 3 years her first 2 payments have been the only ones made on time. $650 in late fees at this point. Signed in 2019, but she pushed back nearly a years worth of payments due to “covid”. Not even halfway through this loan with nearly 3 years left. I’ve communicated openly and honestly with the bank and stood firm in my refusal to pay. I had perfect credit before this mess so at this point I’m willing to have a repossession on my record if it means to get rid of this attachment to her. She doesn’t answer the phone or text messages. I have no idea where she lives. I’ve offered to take the car off her hands multiple times but she has no means to get a different one.

I’m going back to work after being a stay at home mom for a few years and I want to settle this. My address is the only address on file, I could pay off the vehicle and get the title in hand. From here I could transfer ownership into my name only without her signature or being present. -already confirmed with DMV. Problem is she has the vehicle in her possession. She had tags suspended for lapse in insurance and her mom confirmed she was still driving it. Do I take her to court, I feel like courts don’t waste their time with things like this. Or just suffer lol I don’t even know. I feel horrible to think that way I don’t want to be shystie and take the car out from under her but its beginning to financially negatively impact my family.

I am 23 years old but have been working in IT since I was 18. Since I started so early I get paid pretty well in comparison for someone my age. I currently make $35 a hour which is about 70k a year. It is only because of this that I was able to save enough to be able to make a commitment to get married. I had around 20k saved for the wedding and moving in together. We have found a wedding venue and are slowly finding everything that we need and it looks like its all gonna cost close to 20k leaving me with close to nothing. This wasn't a problem because I was still going to be saving from now until the wedding with the expectation of having more than 14k by the time we were married.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the best part. My fiancé confessed to me she has 15k in credit card debt...... I didn't know how to react. I had a whole plan for us for the next three years and I had made sure I was completely debt free so we would have no issues and so I could support us. I am not gonna go into detail about what we talked about but I saw no other option except to take on the debt myself. So I paid 5 thousand of it on the spot with money I had hidden away and then took on another 4k into 0% interest credit cards that I had gotten to pay for the honeymoon because her interest was 29%..... I know. Now I have 4 thousand dollars of credit card debt (0% interest) and I am trying to pay it off affecting how much we were gonna have after we got married. And lets not forget the rest of the 6k she still has left in high interest credit cards.

774,1,"I'm 36, and my wife is 34. We have a taxable account, Roth &amp; a 401K. I am trying to learn more about investing for a comfortable retirement and/or passive income. I tried to take the approach of investing on my own after watching several YouTube videos and reading several articles online. I thought I had a good strategy, but it turns out I have a lot to learn. We owe 140K on our mortgage at a 2% interest rate. Rather than pay it off, I decided to open a taxable account in hopes of getting a better return than 2%, thereby justifying my decision of not paying off the mortgage. I have 3 accounts at Fidelity that I self-direct investments in 1 Roth for myself, my wife's Roth, and an individual account. 

Roths: My wife and I both have Roths setup identical: VTI 70%, VXUS 30%. Each Roth has a total value of 23K. I just rebalanced these they were both FXAIX 45%, FZROX 45%, FZILX 10%. I originally wanted to see how FXAIX &amp; FZROX would perform over a few years side by side. FXAIX outperformed FZROX, but I understand the importance of having exposure to the entire market after reading several reddit posts, so I changed my investments to VTI/VXUS. I also like that ETFs can be bought/sold anytime vs. index funds at the end of the day. I almost went with ITOT/IXUS but ultimately chose the Vanguard etfs due to these etf's having more holdings. 

Taxable: My taxable at Fidelity was 100% individual tech stocks ( I know, I know). I started investing heavily Jan 2022, my plan was to buy stocks that I could hold for 10 years, give or take, and that I felt would not go bankrupt and would be worth much more when I sold them. I assumed the more risk, the more reward, and at first it seemed like a good strategy, but I could not take the pain and sold everything when my losses got to be too much (Dec 2022). This was an 80K loss, I understand that when filing my taxes, I can claim 3K per year against my income and carry this forward each year ( i have no gains to offset). That is all I can do at this point. Tough lesson learned.  Now I am reading, researching &amp; asking experienced investors for their advice so that I never lose that amount of money again.

 Fidelity taxable account: 140K &amp; it is parked in SPAXX. I'm thinking about setting it up identical to my Roth with maybe a small cap tilt, something like VTI 50%/ AVUV 20%/VXUS 30%. Any thoughts? Am I investing in too much of the same thing across these accounts? What would you do? CDs? I have also considered closing this account and eventually buying a rental property since it looks like there is a housing market correction on the horizon. I do not need this money in the near term, but I can't handle watching the value drop like it did with individual stocks. I would like to create passive income with this taxable account that will justify not paying off my 2% mortgage loan. 

401K: I have 75K in a 401K through my employer through John Hancock. Investment allocation &amp; expense ratios: 55% Blackrock S&amp;P 500 index portfolio ER .28, 15% Blackrock US small/ Mid Cap Equity Index portfolio ER .30, 15% JP Morgan US Large Cap Equity Portfolio ER .66, 15% Vanguard Health Care Index Portfolio ER .36. This account has been the hardest for me to decide on allocation due to the funds offered not being that great.  They offer an american funds international equity portfolio ER .72, Wasatch small Cap equity portfolio ER 1.11, Vanguard information technology Index portfolio ER .36, Vanguard balanced index ER .32, SIP stable value portfolio ER .31, John Hancock fixed income portfolio .49 &amp; Target Date: State Street Retirement  2045 portfolio ER .33%.  I was maxing this out but stopped since the funds were doing so poorly.  I do not get an employer match. This is provided in addition to a retirement pension.

But my concern really lies in him not having any form of retirement savings accounts.

We are and have grown up as a low income first generation household - with no experience or relatives who can help us navigate retirement planning or investments and such. I’ve just now convinced him to open a HYSA to keep about 15k that he’s just had sitting in his checkings (I know that’s just the bare minimum) and to discuss his 401k options with his employer. I know since he’s only starting at 55 he needs more. I’m doing my own research but I see conflicting options for opening an IRA at his age. Would a traditional or Roth IRA be better? His income most likely won’t increase significantly through the remainder of his career and most likely stay in the lowest tax bracket. I see that’s one of the most common ways to decide but I’d like to know if there’s anything else to consider. I’m hoping to convince him to open an ira and place the max 7k that he can and then add rest to the HYSA. Is that wise? Idk. If you’ve read this far- thank you so much!

We are exploring moving back to the East coast (DC/Virginia/Maryland) from Los Angeles to be with family. After a month of applying to positions, I’ve had no interviews or bites. My skills are in sales, development and management. I’ve explored project management, variety of sales, creative/ media and various development jobs. I’m happy to take an entry level position to learn. I’ve had resume evaluations, but feel ultimately film and TV may appear too outside of what people may be looking for.

Our goal is to be able to afford a house at some point, raise our newborn, and live somewhat normally, and we’re struggling taking off. 

We have no debt, but our finances after a very bleak year are approaching dangerous levels. Any help from the wise folks on this board about how to transition from a very alien industry would be much appreciated.",Industry change help

792,1,"Hi all, with the new year I did some thinking about my long-term financial goals, and there are two things I have always wanted:

* Retire early
   * I don't hate working, but I want to be financially independent and have the freedom to do what I want in life, travel, non-profit work, startups, etc. And the quickest way to achieve this is to build up enough savings to retire early
* Own a penthouse/large single-family home
   * This is obviously a luxury/ambition. But I really feel like it's the American dream to own your own place and have a big house for your family and friends. Unfortunately I live in a very HCOL city, and the average cost of one of these ranges between $2M to 3M. The only alternative would be to move out of this city, but I am tied to this area for now due to my job

Here are the steps that I have taken to accomplish my goals and other personal info:

* I am in my early 20s, making $170k pre-tax annually (working for about 3 years), excluding RSUs
   * On average I have received 8 to 13% raises/promotions per year
   * I get about 20k to 30k of RSUs a year vested over 4 years quarterly
* I max out my 401k and HSA contributions and employer match with a combined total of $120k right now
* I max out my Roth IRA which sits at 20k
* Beyond that I have accumulated personal savings/brokerage for another $120k.
* With the good pandemic housing market in 2021, I bought up a small home for about 600k with about 400k remaining on it (making extra monthly payments to principal)

In order to retire early in my 30s, I would expect to need about $2.5M to 3M. At the same time, to own a penthouse/large single-family home it would also cost that much. From my perspective, beyond becoming a millionaire somehow and/or vastly increasing my income it doesn't seem possible to do both.

The way I see it, I would either need to move to a very LCOL city or change jobs to receive higher salary and bonuses.

807,1,"Specifically, the basement/crawlspace and attic are very cost-effective places to insulate. This is especially true for houses older than a couple decades. I have no personal stake in the insulation business and say all this as someone who learned from working on my own home. Here are some tips:

* Basement/crawlspace: are the walls just bare concrete? Is there any insulation between the joists under the house's floor? If no to both--or if there is insulation under the floor but it's sagging or damp--the insulation is inadequate and you're losing tons of energy (and money) through the foundation walls.
   * These days, [most people advise insulating the inside of the foundation walls](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-insulate-crawl-space-4796956) and not under the first floor (though if you already have insulation under the floor and it's in good shape, you can keep it).
   * I'm a fan of [EPS foam board](https://www.homedepot.com/p/R-Tech-2-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-R-7-7-Rigid-Foam-Insulation-310891/202532856) because it's cheap, works well, easy to DIY, and causes less pollution than other types of foam. Colder climates will probably want 2 layers of foam board (R-15); warmer climates might be ok with 1. In my case, I calculated a payoff time of around 2-5 years for adding these; it would be even faster if I kept my house at more typical heating/cooling temperatures.
   * If you have a crawlspace, you may want to seal the crawlspace floor with a vapor barrier (""encapsulation""). If you have a moisture problem down there, you should definitely do that. Now is a good time to run a cheap test for [radon in your house](https://www.epa.gov/radon/how-do-i-get-radon-test-kit-are-they-free) to protect you and your family from lung cancer; if you have radon, encapsulating the crawlspace will be a big part of the treatment.
* Attic: [if you have an attic, blowing in insulation is cheap and you can rent a machine to DIY it if you want. ](https://www.thespruce.com/cut-energy-bills-with-blown-insulation-1398049)Take a look up there and use [this site](https://insulationinstitute.org/im-a-homeowner/about-insulation/how-much-do-i-need/) to determine if you have enough, and how much you should add.
* Walls: unlike attics and crawlspaces, walls are harder and more expensive to insulate. However, if you're doing a remodel project that involves removing wall sheathing already, you should definitely assess whether you wall insulation is adequate, and improve it if needed. [This site](https://insulationinstitute.org/im-a-homeowner/about-insulation/how-much-do-i-need/) has some notes on wall insulation at the bottom.
* Sealing leaks: this is potentially the most cost-effective item on the list. Search for leaks in the crawlspace and attic (easiest before insulation is added). Leaks in the house matter too, but leaks at the top and bottom of the house matter most. There's a good chance you'll find holes big enough for a cat to crawl through, and those should be blocked with wood or foam board. Smaller leaks can be sealed with spray foam or caulk.
* Energy assessment: you can hire an expert to come out, assess how leaky your house is and whether the insulation is adequate, and recommend fixes.",A new 30% federal tax credit on insulation means now is a great time to reduce your heating/cooling bill

831,1,"Hi, I'm 25, live in a major city on the west coast and have been working a full-time remote position for just under a year. it pays $3\~4 above minimum wage and after rent, (NOT including utilities) I only bring home about $850 a month. 

As I said it's a remote job so I'm home 5 days a week and spend the weekends running errands, and seeing my SO and family, I have no social life whatsoever, feel extremely miserable, and absolutely HATE my job. I have no passion for it and it's def not in the field I'm interested to pursue a career in.

I have around $4000 in my savings, I don't have any debts, and am moving back with my parents (not the most ideal situation but I don't have any other choice) starting next month. I also won't have to pay next month's rent for my apartment since it was paid as a deposit when I moved in.

So my expenses for the next few months would be food, restaurants (only when I'm with my SO), phone, and monthly subscriptions (around $30/month).

Do you think it's a reasonable decision to quit my job? there's absolutely no room for growth for me in this job and my mental health is deteriorating due to having to stay in all day all week.

but at the same time, I'm kinda scared to quit even though if I did, I'd have more time to work on my resume, look for a new position, open availability for interviews, etc.

Where I'm confused is how the IRS categorizes remote work.

836,1,"Last year, I made the mistake of choosing an apartment that was more expensive that I should've gone for. At the time, I was making enough to afford it and had a couple thousand of savings for emergency funds. I had to budget in order to keep all my funds in place but it wasn't stressful.

Jump to July, and I quitted my job due to work harassment. I found another job quickly but it didn't pay as much and was almost worse. I quit that one too and am now working one that pays great but I barely get 30 hours when they promised full-time. I also had a month in-between jobs where I used all my savings for rent.

I now have to live check-to-check with a job that doesn't pay enough. I've been late on rent every month (which is an added $200 late fee) and they're threatening eviction if I don't pay by the 20th this month. My lease ends first week of March so I don't think they'll actually evict me but I'm worried I won't be able to get another apartment with my funds being zero at the end of each month due to rent. Also, I really doubt my landlord is going to put in a good word at this point if they check references (my previous two apartments though would cite me as never paying late). 

I've tried applying for personal loans and credit cards but I've been rejected due to not making enough money ($35000 per year). My credit is 650 so it's not terrible. I've been selling old electronics and video games just to make rent at this point. 

I'm not really sure what to do. I'm looking for a new job which hopefully will be able to lessen the stress a bit but I'm so behind in payments right now and it's stressing me out. I can't move back home because it's an unhealthy environment. I have two cats so rooming with other people usually isn't going to work, and I have a bf who'd probably let me live with him but I really don't want to resort to that (it's only a few months into the relationship).

837,1,"Recently inherited a decent chunk of change and have been looking at the best option to put it for 1 year until I am ready to buy a house. I'm based in California, so high state tax rates. I'm in the 24% income bracket federally and 9.3% CA tax bracket, so I was thinking a money market fund with tax exemptions would be the best, but was curious to hear if there was anything I'm missing.  

I put together the data below for a few options I looked at and a sample yield of investing $100k in each:

Investment | Interest Rate | Yield post-tax | Tax Exemptions

Right away I knew that I wanted to find a permanent place here. Not to sound overly dramatic, but I have found way more than I realized I would in this job. I have found purpose, I have found passion, and I have found balance in my work.

As I hit my one-year review, I feel so proud of how far I have come. When I initially started this job, I wasn't sure what it entailed--it was uncharted territory but I was excited for the adventure. I know I have a great ability to handle a large capacity of learning, conflict, and perseverance, but this job has challenged me beyond my imagination and I honestly think I am better for it. I have started learning new languages like HTML and SQL. I have learned extensively about [my state]’s laws around education, not to be confused with my new knowledge of federal programs like McKinney-Vento. I have learned the ins and outs of state reporting, managing clean data, and showing up for people when they need it and their tasks depend on it. I have learned how to create extensive spreadsheets that answers important, district wide questions. I have served every single director on this campus (maybe minus the maintenance director:) and every principal.

I name all of this not because I am not humble or lack a sense of humility, but really because I believe what I do is important and I'm proud of that. Additionally, I don't think my compensation fairly matches my role's responsibilities. From my research, which considers all major tasks I am in charge of or support, a starting base for my position that would seem to support market value is $70,820-$78,400. This considers  enrollment coordinating, being an IT tech and helping with helpdesk tickets around data and our SIS, being our SIS’s programmer, and of course being our district's registrar, along with having a large role in state reporting. While I don't have a ""perfect"" number in my head to ask for, I do want to be valued at the fair market rate.

I initially wanted to give this job my all for one year before I presumed to understand it's worth. Now that I have, I would like to continue this work indefinitely and I feel I now have the knowledge to understand what it truly takes to be successful at this job and what that means fiscally.

844,1,[removed],(31m) where to put savings for a house?
845,1,"Hey folks, I was just informed that my job is relocating me and the family to Denver this summer. Looking at the house prices there however has had my wife and I somewhat panicky and unsure of how much house we can truly afford. To get something similar to what we currently own would be around the $800k mark, an almost 175% increase to what we paid for our house. We are currently a one income family (soon to change when my wife completes her degree in a few years) with a 5 y/o who will start kindergarten this year. Here's a quick breakdown of our finances:

Income: $168k a year
VA disability: $27k a year
Equity in current home: Approx. $200k
No CC debt
Current Mortgage: $265k remaining on $310k at 3.25% or $1700/mo
Student Loans: $28k (deferred while wife is in school)
Vehicle: $9k ($529/mo at 3.49%)
401k/IRA/HSA: Maxed each year
Savings: $5k
Health Insurance/Dental: $5.6k a year
Pension Contribution: $8k/year
Credit Score: 800+

When we sell our current residence I plan to pay off the vehicle with equity to save us another $529 per month. Minus the realtor fee of approximately 3%, that would give us a ballpark range of around $180k to use as a down payment for our next home. My napkin math at the end gives us approximately $5000 a month or so that we could technically use towards a mortgage. However, that would likely leave us with nothing leftover outside of our budget which is unrealistic. I've since ran the numbers through a mortgage calculator for an $800k home with a 30 year term at 6% and got an approximate of $4200 a month. 

So while the numbers do work in theory, I'd like a second, third and fourth pair of eyes to make sure we aren't crazy to try and take on a mortgage like this.",Can we afford a VHCOL city?

I initiated these about a year at a total $80k principal, and have focused heavily on paying down the 21% loan (about $12k left).  If not possible to get a worthwhile APR then I assume I'm probably best just paying them off as a priority. Here are some more facts to consider:

I have about $270k income (salary); mid 30's, no house (rent+parking+utilities is about $2500/month); 750+ credit score (680 at loan initiation); $85k in federal student loans averaging about 6.5% APR (covid frozen, but that will end soon); and $45k in aforementioned personal loans at 16-21% APR.  I just started receiving this high salary about a year ago, as I used to be in non-profit/public interest before going back to school, so I don't have significant non-retirement savings -- only have about $10k in spare cash. I have no issue making the monthly loan payments and have in fact paid off significantly faster to avoid interest, but I would like the flexibility to add to retirement or dca into investments when reasonable, and also to maintain an emergency fund for potential layoffs in this economy, unforeseen medical, etc.  I've tried things like lending tree to estimate loan rates, and all the preliminary offers are 15% or above which makes it seem not worth the credit hit for the small amount of interest I would be saving (would like to potentially buy a house in next few years).

869,1,"I haven't been able to find the answer to this in the subreddit guide or online.

I've been putting my 401(k) contributions into Roth the past few years, because I figured it was better to pay taxes on it up front, rather than let it build up to a huge chunk of money and have a large chunk taken out when I retire.

But now that I think about it, if people quit their corporate job at lets say 63, and for the last 2 years work as an unofficial ""advisor"" or a consultant, or self employed business making $30k, wouldn't their entire haul be taxed at the lowest rate? Is this a common practice?

Because of that, our income for the year is much lower than normal and our MAGI is below the $109,000 phase out for making deductible Traditional IRA contributions. (We are both covered by workplace retirement plans.)

Despite that, we both did Backdoor Roth IRA contributions/conversions in early 2022. This is chiefly because we get a state tax benefit - the State of Illinois [does not tax Roth conversions](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=276494) so we are able to avoid state income taxes on the contributions. 

I'm preparing an early version of our tax return via FreeTaxUSA, which is not allowing me to enter the Traditional IRA contributions as non-deductible because we are **entitled** to the deduction. 

As far as I can tell the end result is the same. We take the deduction on the contribution but the deduction is wiped out by the Roth conversion. However I am having some trouble wrapping my brain around this and just want to verify that I am doing this correctly.

883,1,"**Key points**

* How ""cash rich"" strategies can benefit in a high interest rate environment
* The advantage of holding treasury bills
* How to purchase treasury bills in a TD Ameritrade account

Defined outcome strategies that I have been using to reduce my risk in the market are net credit or neutral, meaning when you execute an outcome no cash is used. I don't like to use margin (or “naked” options), the short puts in my defined outcome trades are fully collateralized. Meaning any active outcome typically holds capital in the form of cash in my brokerage account until maturity. In the event of assignment, I have the cash ready to purchase shares at the strike price assigned. As a result, this kind of investing strategy is considered ""cash rich."" 

**Why it matters:** In a zero interest rate environment, holding cash is fine because there is no opportunity cost. But as risk-free interest rates rise, the opportunity to generate income on cash can be substantial.  

**What can you do?** Use the cash being held as collateral to buy treasury bills. The [current annualized yield](https://ycharts.com/indicators/3_month_t_bill#:~:text=3%20Month%20Treasury%20Bill%20Rate%20is%20at%204.51%25%2C%20compared%20to,day%20and%200.09%25%20last%20year.) on a 3 month treasury bill is 4.51%. There are several reasons why you might choose to hold Treasury Bills instead of cash:

* **Safety**: Treasury Bills are considered to be very safe investments because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. This means that there is no risk that you will lose your money if you hold Treasury Bills until maturity.
* **Yield**: Treasury Bills typically pay a lower yield than other investments, such as stocks or bonds. However, they may still offer a slightly higher yield than cash, which typically does not pay any interest.
* **Liquidity**: Treasury Bills are very liquid, which means that they can be easily bought and sold on the open market. This makes them a convenient investment option if you need to access your money quickly.

**How to purchase treasury bills**

One of the easiest ways to buy treasuries as well as other fixed income investments is using the bond wizard on TD Ameritrade. They've got educational resources that walk you through the steps to add treasury securities to your portfolio.

I planned on keeping this car until my student loans were paid off but life had other plans for me I guess (I put $2k into maintenance a week before it was stolen :D).

Some background about me, I'm 22, and have a very good credit score for my age. Last I checked a couple days ago it is 760. What is killing my credit score is how little I've had accounts open for, it's been about 5 years but that's the thing weighing my score down. I make $70k base + $10k with bonus and pay differential. I have both private and public loans equaling \~$40k. I graduated last January and started paying my private loans off in June 2022. So far I have been putting \~$800 into my private loans with the higher interest rates (almost as high as 8% thanks COVID), but have been paying the monthly minimum lately because I moved back across the country to live with my parents to deal with family problems. 

Right now I am at a loss, the responsible side of me doesn't want to get a new car even though I could afford it. The other side of me doesn't want to buy a used car for $2k-$3k less and miss out on the manufacturer warranty and the fact that it has miles on it. 

I have $10,000 I'm willing to put down on a car. I'm trying to figure out whether I should try to find a beater that won't kill me in maintenance costs, buy a cheaper used car that will depreciate thousands of dollars once the market flips. Or buy a nice shiny new car that will hold its value a bit better and won't come with the headache of a used car. 

Right now I'm looking at Hondas or Toyotas, I qualify for their recent graduate program of $500 off and my credit is good enough to get their lower APRs (\~2.9%-3.9%).

My family are all spenders, I am a saver..... at least I try to be. These higher interest student loan rates are driving me up a wall. If I were to invest money I could put towards my student loans it'd probably be a wash considering how high those rates are.

I don't use a password vault. Well, not really.

I use Google. There is only one  password  not in it- the Master Google account one (and it's something like (8iH1@DK19!19jAwkkKj). All passwords are different, and all are random strings.

I also use 2fa on the Google account- using a Google Voice number tied to account (which was fine until one day when I went to ubreakifix, I wiped my Pixel device without thinking, and permanently locked myself out of my Google account (Gmail and Google Voice).


Problem was the 2fa would send a authentication code to either that email, or to that Google Voice number.  I couldn't access the account in order to retrieve the code to authenticate the account to gain access to the account. So basically I effed myself, and  the random alpha numeric symbol password was useless.

4 months later Google sent a account recovery link to my Microsoft recovery email account. I am glad I had the foresight to set that up, and confirm it prior to this.

I won't ever get locked out again though as I created the Google Security [backup codes](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1187538?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid), and backed them up to a biometric locked file on another non-Google account, and one backup code, and the Google Password is in my wife's possession. 10 codes. One time use.

Basically, even if someone got my Password to my Google account which contains all my saved passwords, they cant access the account without authenticating and getting a text code to the Google Voice account which requires authentication to access itself (or by using an account authentication one time use backup code).

Google Voice numbers can't be ported without being unlocked after account authentication, and there is no SIM to swap.

I know the IRS uses Modified Adjusted Gross Income to determine this, and that AGI is on the 1040 tax form. The issue is that I don’t get a 1040, only a W2, and even if I knew my AGI I’m not sure how to go about calculating MAGI. I know there are multiple ways to calculate it so I’m not sure what is acceptable by IRS standards.

922,1,"Hello Personal Finance, I joined last year &amp; have seen the advice you all give regarding financial struggles

My own situation, I graduated grad school in August and I was luckily hired right out of grad school making 85K a year, which isn’t a lot in NY, still I am extremely grateful that I was one of the lucky students that found something. 

I am currently in 15K credit card debt spread over 4 credit cards. I have a Sallie Mae loan for 16K with payments set to begin in April. I have a Federal Government loan with payments set to begin in September, 2023 for $270,000, which I plan on paying back through IDR. 

For more context, Before grad school I was in virtually no Credit Card debt, but after fighting with my parents I had to move out twice (once before grad school and once during) and that’s where most of my credit card debt came from. I did not have a stable job while living on my own &amp; used the school loan to cover off campus housing while using my CC to cover living expenses. I was also in two car accidents (one before grad school, one during) which caused me to dip into my Credit Cards even further &amp; that’s essentially how I ended up in this much CC debt. 

After following this page I made my own kind of personal finance sheet and wanted to know if I could be more efficient in tackling my debt. 

Income: $85,000 
Take Home Pay After Taxes: $2270 Biweekly ; $4540 Monthly 

Sallie Mae Loan: $16,000 12%APR 

Credit Card debt
American Express: $5330 - 29.99% APR

Discover: $5611 - 24% APR

Apple Credit Card: $3755 - 26% APR

Capital One: $900 - 27.74% 
[P.S called my banks and no one would lower the APR, in total I’ve had all CCs for about 4-6 years while only making the minimum payment, before grad school I had a job at Apple working full time and that’s why the CC company’s gave me a high credit limit. When I was working full time &amp; before my accidents &amp; before grad school my FCIO score was around 760. Moving out / the car accidents / leaving apple to go to grad school are what really messed me up.]

My main goal is to pay down my CC debt as efficiently as possible. I am currently paying 240$ a month towards my Amex &amp; Discover Credit Cards simultaneously and plan to raise that to 300$ by April or May if I can afford it. I am paying 180$ towards my Apple Credit card &amp; $50 towards my capital one. In sum, I am paying over the minimum amount for everything. 

I recently sold my car, and I have had to suck up my pride and move back in with my parents so I am not paying rent or car payments/insurance. I plan on paying the Sallie Mae loan over 8 years which would be 270$ a month but I am thinking of just making the minimum payment there &amp; putting the money left over towards my Amex/Discover card instead. 

I would like advice on my Credit Card payment plan, does that sound like a good idea or would the snow ball method be better? I believe because my APR &amp; my debt for Amex/Discover card being relatively the same I am better off paying them down at the same time than only focusing on the Amex card. Realistically I would love to be Credit Card debt free in 18-24 months and that’s when I think my life will finally begin again!

So, is it correct that the minimum payment they expect is 2.16% of the total outstanding balance?

Essentially, if I take this card, transfer my Capital One (34.9% APR) balance to this Vanquis card (29.3%), would the next 9 months be 'fee free'? So I won't be hit with that odd-£50 fine, pay off an additional £900, and only then around September/October start getting that fee again - all in all saving me about £400-450?

965,1," 

I live in an apartment with three others. One roommate has lived here for 6 months and has consistently been behind on rent/utilities. He hasn't really been looking for work in this timeframe either.

This has caused him to fall months behind on rent/utilities and our landlord has contacted us that we need to send in all of his outstanding payments by eod to avoid moving forward with collections. According to her, since all of our names are on the lease, we are all equally liable in collections despite us three always paying on time. When this roommate signed the lease originally, he had his dad sign as a guarantor since he had no income at the time. The guarantor is his father who has not been particularly responsive. We talked to him last night and he did not seem confident that he's able to pay moving forward (lease goes through June).

None of us are comfortable loaning him the money since we have seen how hard it is to get him to pay things back. We have kept our landlord in the loop every step of the way and have a call with her today to talk through next steps.

These are my questions:

1. According to the guarantor language below, do we have any leg to stand on in terms of isolating collections on the roomate/guarantor not paying rent?
2. Assuming he can't pay today, it seems like the only option is to cover his outstanding balance, so we don't take the credit hit, and begin looking for a new roommate. Are there any other options I'm missing?

Come my first paycheck in December, the appropriate amounts are withheld for my health insurance, life insurance, etc. but there is no 401k withholding. I talked to HR. They basically said “oops, we must have reset the 90-day thing when we corrected your name. Sorry. It’ll kick in 90 days from then.” I asked if this could be retroactively corrected and they said they’d look into it but haven’t been very forthcoming when I’ve asked about updates.

Obviously as an individual of somewhat modest means I don’t have the cash laying around to buy such an expensive thing outright, so financing will be involved. 

My research has brought me to what is called a tax lease, which is a loan term commonly offered by lenders that specialize in capital equipment investments like this. Essentially a lease term is set up (similar to a loan) with a purchase option at the end of it, at which point you would own it outright. The monthly lease payments up until that point are then tax deductible since you’re technically “renting” the equipment for business purpose. 

My question is do you have to have an LLC established to realize these benefits, or could you write this off against your day job’s W2 (which is currently my sole source of income)?  Reason I ask is I’ve come across vague references to a requirement that specifies use of the equipment for business purposes in order to be able to write off the lease payments against your taxable income. Obviously if the IRS wanted to look, you’re going to have a harder time proving business use if you don’t yet have an established business or any of the associated paper trail.  Since this is not starting out as a full time thing for me it’s going to take a while to establish a niche and any kind of consistent revenue. 

This may seem like kind of a simple question but I don’t have much (any)  experience navigating anything like this.

996,1,"When it comes to paying off credit cards, the most prevalent advice I see is to pay off the card with the highest interest rate first.

...but that doesn't consider each card's overall balance, so I expect that it really depends.  
Here's a hypothetical example of 2 cards:  
Card 1: Higher interest rate, lower balance. Last interest charge was $20.  
Card 2: Lower interest rate, higher balance. Last interest charge was $50.

It seems to me that I should get the Card #2 interest charge down to $20 before I think about paying more on Card #1 – even though Card #1 has a higher interest rate.

After all, the interest charge is ultimately the cost of borrowing money - so it would be wise to focus on reducing that cost. This would be the card with the higher interest ***charge*** \- which is not always the card with the higher interest ***rate***.

I never used any website as bad as Optum:

**1st attempt**: I requested to sell all my investment (I only have one SWPPX fund), but Optum only allows you to request selling using dollar amount, not share units. So two days later when the transaction settled, it turned out (likely due to fund pricing variation) they left about 13 dollars (about 0.3 shares) on my SWPPX balance. This showed as a settled transaction on my history as ""SALE DUE TO FUND TRANSFER "" one day after request.

**2nd attempt**: I then requested to sell that remaining 13 dollars again following the same procedure. This time they showed a transaction history to ""credit 13 dollars into my HSA cash account"", with type ""SELL INVESTMENTS"". But my cash account didn't see any change. Now three (trading) days passed, and nothing happened. I still see the 0.3 shares on my portfolio. I still see no settled transaction for that 13 dollars. AND, the website does not stop me from initiating another request to sell the remaining portfolio either after I tentatively tried to (it used to block me saying there is pending transaction and I needed to wait). It is like the 2nd liquidation order did not go through at all.

Called my employer's HSA management phone number (as instructed by Optum), they have no idea what is going on and all confused. Called Optum, got the usual running around and no one had a clue what they were talking about.

Should I request to liquidate again? I don't even know if my previous (2nd) liquidation request is still being processed or not so I am not certain another liquidation request will complicate the matter, but we are close to the transfer deadline :(

I’m a work from home contractor for a credit bureau. I live in New Mexico, my company is out of state if that matters? I’ve been in this position 1 year 3 months. I get paid $18/hr weekly. Every Thursday/Friday for the past year my check deposit has been exactly $558.64, on every paycheck, literally I have the stubs to prove it. It’s always exactly the same amount because I don’t have a time clock so in my time sheet every week it’s always the exact time I input, 40 hours down to the second. 

Here’s the problem:

Today my deposit was $458.76. I quickly logged onto my workstation and checked my paystub. Nothing has changed. Hourly rate $18/hr still the same. 40 hours worked. My tax withholding for fed and state however have all nearly doubled. For no reason? That’s where my extra $100 went. 

I contacted HR for an explanation and she said “sometimes taxes increase and that’s that.” So essentially I can kiss $400 a month ($5000 yearly) down the drain and now it’ll basically be like I took a pay cut and am working for $14/hr now because reasons?

How can this be?? Am I missing something? I’m no spring chicken and at no place I’ve ever worked at in the past has my take home pay been slashed at the start of the new year for seemingly no reason.

1) buy a starter home and pay off in five years. Pros - I’m very risk averse and don’t want to over leverage, plus this gives mobility. 

2) buy a duplex and rent one side. I’ve have some friends have success with this and my partner is a licensed inspector and has been an individual property manager before.

1019,1,"Hi Reddit, I'm a first time home buyer running into some seriously weird issues with an HOA, and curious about the legality of some of the stunts they're pulling. I'm a veteran using the VA loan. Nothing has closed yet, but things are getting close enough to start worrying. Sorry for the long post, but there's a lot to question.

My partner and I are purchasing a condo unit in Chicago. We have already agreed to a price with the seller, our lender has approved the loan, the appraisal and inspection are both completed as well. When it came time to drop off some money orders to the front office, we started seeing some serious problems.

The building manager was great, up until we handed her the sales contract and the number for money down was still blank. Our lender told us to leave this blank for the time being, just so VA loan stuff could clear and it didn't need to be there until way closer to closing anyway. Here's where the fun starts:

The building manager asked what our ""loan to value"" was rather quickly and we were stumped, because as newbies, we aren't great with a lot of terms. We told her we were doing a VA loan, and she immediately snaps back with, ""oh, so do you have the 20 months of assessment fees available to pay?"" We had absolutely no idea what she was talking about and let her know that. She prints off page 22 and 23 of their 40 page HOA rulebook and shows us a clause buried in there where if you put down 0%, you owe 20 months of assessment fees. She did some quick math to show we would end up owing just shy of what a 10% down payment would look like.

She also included 2 parking spots and cable/internet. The parking spots are on a waitlist and we were like 8 spots down, so she pulled those numbers right out of thin air, and the cable/internet is already on the assessment fee and she listed it again. So I'm feeling like it's pretty obvious she's trying to scare us off.

It doesn't end there. She is also requesting we each file a credit report through a company they use, again, after we've already been through this with our lender/bank and received credit scores from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. I asked if they could just get this from our lender since it's already been done, and I was given a stern no, it has to be through this specific company. They gave us a number, an extension, ask for ""Name"". For what it's worth, both of our credit scores are very good. Certainly more than sufficient for this place.

They have also requested that the next HOA board meeting they have, that we meet them remotely so they can basically ""interview"" us and it sounds like they're going to approve us moving in.

The 20 months of assessment payments WERE provided in the HOA rulebook they gave us, but we didn't receive it at the beginning when we were discussing with the seller. It was also buried in an email with a total of 63 PDFs, only one of which was the rulebook. Everything else was just cover pages, meeting minutes, small potatoes and nothing-pages. No one except the HOA was aware of this 20 month assessment fee. Not us, our realtor, lawyer, lender, the seller, the seller's broker, the seller's lawyer, no one had a clue until we told them the building manager hit us with it and everyone is arguing this fee should have been front and center. Also, none of us (seller's side included) have ever heard of such a clause and we're all in agreement that it sounds absolutely insane.

Our lender told us to basically tell them to kick rocks on having our credit hit again for their report, as this is a pretty bad thing to do during a major purchase. If they want credit scores, they can get them from him if he even deems it necessary.

Our realtor suspects that ""voting in"" people in the building sounds like something a co-op does and doubts this is even legal. Our lawyer is looking into how they got around this being a form of discrimination.

So, I'm wondering if anyone has ever seen anything like this? How can we hack this apart? Is this stuff even legal? Even if we beat these fees, what are the odds the HOA just messes with us the entire time we're there? It isn't too late to back out and cut our losses, but it's getting way too close to let it go.

Thanks in advance!",HOA is pulling some seriously strange and seemingly nefarious stunts. Can you guys give me some insights?

I’ve tried to research this question and couldn’t find the answer. My employer’s 401K allows for pre-tax, Roth, and after tax contributions with in-service withdrawal capabilities.

I typically max out my $22.5K 401K contributions, subtract employer match and contribute the rest after tax up to the (now) $66K limit.

Our 401K funds are not great so I really like rolling my after tax contributions into a Roth IRA and being able to invest in VTSAX.

If I could only afford to do one, I’d want to take advantage of the post tax contributions (and transfer to Roth IRA) given the better investment options, but have typically always maxed out so it was never an issue. I might be rethinking that this year and realized I wasn’t sure if you had to have $22.5K in 401K (pre-tax or Roth) contributed by year end to be allowed (by IRS etc.) to do after tax contributions or if it is okay to only / mostly do after tax.","Do I have to do $22.5K in 401K contributions by end of year to do a mega backdoor Roth?

1035,1,"I’ve been watching for used cars, and one I like is available for a good price, through a non-dealership store (Carvana). 

I’ve been preapproved for a loan through Carvana, with a decent, but not great interest rate. This was not a hard enquiry and the rate quoted to me was described as a “minimum rate”, meaning once they actually check my numbers it could increase (I have good credit, 740s, but it’s not immaculate). 

I have a checking and savings account through Big Bad American Bank, and there are three credit unions in my town, but no “in” through my employer. I believe they are all open to the public. One of them I know has been here for years, the other two I think are new, I’ve never heard others mention them and they didn’t pop up when I was thinking about this a few years ago. 

So, how do I shop for a loan? I don’t really want to convert my entire (meager) financial portfolio to a different bank, although I know there’s many very good reasons to not bank with whom I currently use. I’m open to moving everything to a credit union, but I don’t know how to choose one - is it simply who offers me the lowest interest rate (assuming other benefits are on par with what I have/expect)?

Then, what is the order of operations for staking a claim on the car, agreeing to a loan, going to the “store” and taking possession? (They can deliver the car to me but I feel weird about buying it sight unseen; store is 1hr away). Does the credit Union issue me a check, or is there some process done at the store with my account number?

1045,1,"My husband and I both make good salaries, with a large portion of my annual salary coming in my annual bonus. Usually I use this bonus to get ahead on bills, max out simple IRA, put some money in stocks, and for home improvements. This year, after maxing out my IRA I netted roughly $45k, which I was planning to use for a badly needed renovation. Unfortunately, my HVAC unit also bit the dust this week, which will be $5500 to repair. 

I was already nervous putting all of the money into the kitchen, given it would not leave me with much liquid savings for emergencies, and now with the HVAC expense I don’t think I will have enough to do the kitchen. My kitchen cabinets are falling apart so I really don’t want to wait another year to do the renovation and I want to knock out a wall/change the footprint as part of the renovation, so I kind of need to do it all at once. 

We don’t have any debt aside from my husband and my car notes (and my mortgage), but I have money already set aside to pay those monthly payments for the year. I pay off my credit cards in full every month. Our parents are also well off, so if we were to ever fall on some really hard times they would help us out if needed. 

So with all of this being said, I had an idea that I could open up a new credit card with a 0% intro APR to pay for the HVAC and some of the home renovation cost, pay the minimum balance during the year, and then pay off the card in full with my next annual bonus (which should be around the same amount or more).

Is there any reason this would be a bad idea? I have never not paid my credit cards in full, so using a card like this would definitely be new to me. The only problem I am anticipating is that I may not be able to pay for the home improvement expenses with a credit card, but in this case I would just put more of my regular household expenses on that 0% APR card (and still pay it off at the end of the year).",Should I put home renovation costs on new credit card?

My wife and I recently got married and have been reviewing our upcoming budget for 2023. Given that 2022 will be the first year we file jointly for taxes, we had a question around Traditional vs. Roth 401(k) contributions.

In prior years, our joint income exceeded the limit for Roth IRA contributions. Since then, we've focused solely on maximizing contributions to Traditional IRAs.

However, given the lack of an income limit for Roth 401(k) contributions, we're wondering if we should continue contributing there. Both of our employers offer this and we've both been contributing a small portion to it (currently \~5% Roth, \~10% Traditional). I've read prior posts and outside thought pieces on this but no one has distilled the proper pathway very well.

We're very fortunate in that we plan to max out our Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s - just in case this plays a factor in how we allocate the contributions.

We currently pay them rent equivalent to the monthly maintenance ($1650 per month) and they pay the property taxes (approximately $30K per year). There is no mortgage.

We're financially comfortable enough to absorb the tax bill; it means that a lot of money we'd been putting towards savings (IRA, etc) would instead go to property taxes. 

If we assume ownership as individuals, we can get a pretty substantial rebate on the tax bill since it's our primary residence, but that would involve dissolving the LLC. I'm not sure what the tax implications of that are.

1069,1,"Hello everyone. I'm a self employed gig economy worker that just hit 2 years of continuous full time 1099 work. I don't make a lot of money, but I make enough to get by. Luckily I have a wonderful fiance who splits expenses with me.

Yesterday we went to my local credit union to open a new account, and we decided to try refinancing our 2018 Chevy Cruze that is in both of our names. Our credit scores are 'fair' at around 620. I very recently all but paid off a $1,000 credit card, so likely my score is higher.

Anyways, everything seemed to have checked out. They pulled our credit, and said they need proof of income, insurance cards, registration, etc. I informed the bank that I did not yet file for 2022 yet, so I do not have 2 solid years of self employment income to report yet. They said that's okay, and so after submitting my 2021 and 2020 returns, they told me that my income is not enough to refinance.

In 2020 I believe I made around $20,000 because I still had a W2 job for about 2 months. I also own an LLC that I've operated since 2016 which turns a profit of about $2-$4k a year. Surely my 1099 work yields at least $13,000 or so a year.

But now that I'm looking at my numbers from 2022, it appears as though my 1099 work only yielded about $12k, I'm not positive though considering Shipt deactivated me in March 2022 and I have no access to those earnings until they send me a 1099. I'd estimate that with Shipt I made around $14,000 last year altogether excluding my LLC.

My concern is that I have tried to do 2 years of continuous self employed work because mortgage lenders typically need 2 years of tax returns to determine whether or not I can get a house. I learned this about a year ago, so I was 1 year in and figured I'd keep going with the self employment since I was already halfway there.

Even with my fiance's full time W2 income accounted for and her credit score, they wouldn't even let us refinance a car. Do we have a chance at even getting a mortgage on a cheap $20k-$30k trailer? Or did I essentially waste 2 years of my time? Would our chances of being able to get a home increase once our credit scores go up? As I mentioned earlier my credit card was paid off, but I didn't really give any time for the bureau to update my score, which in hindsight I probably should have.

Common sense tells me that a mortgage should be much different than an auto loan to be approved for, considering mortgages have much longer terms of 15/30 years. We also plan on using our tax refunds to put as a down payment. Perhaps I'm worrying too much? I'm not sure though.

Then $8,333 x 6% x 50%= $250 pay period match even though you contributed $6k in the first paycheck?

1096,1,"Most of the info is in the title, but some more below:

Just the other day, sitting around watching a Christmas movie with my visiting family, at like 11pm at night, I got 4 texts all within seconds of each other.  Two came from Chase (my amazon card and my sapphire preferred card), one from Fidelity (my 2% everything card), and one from Navy Federal (my debit card).

All of them said basically the same thing, along the lines of ""we detected a fradulent charge for Walmart+ for $108.xx, did you authorize this? Reply Yes or No"".  Of course I said No immediately to all of them, as I don't even know what Walmart+ is.

All of them canceled my cards and said new ones were on the way.  I called NFCU that same night (using the number I know for  a fact is them) since they're truly 24/7/365, plus it's my actual bank/debit/checking, ya know?  They confirmed it had happened and were overnighting me a new card.  I called Chase and Fidelity the next day using numbers on the back of their cards, and they each confirmed it was a legit text, it was fraud, and my cards were nixxed and new on the way.

Cool beans, nothing lost but ~30 hours of not being able to buy anything except with emergency cash... and having to update all my autopays across different subscriptions and shit.

**All that being said**... What else, if anything, should I do?  And how would this have happened in the first place?  4 cards all compromised at once, all attempted the same charge at the same time.  They have nothing in common except obviously *me*.  The debit card NEVER gets used, the Amazon card is only on Amazon, the Sapphire card is only used for its 3% things (dining, streaming, etc.), and the Fidelity card for everything else.  None of them are like, tied to the same store or anything that could have been hacked.  So at this point I'm just scratching my head as to HOW this happened more than anything else.","All of my cards (debit included) were fraudulently charged for a $108 Walmart+ membership within 1 min of each other.

1097,1,"Hi all,

I recently started a new job and will be enrolling in a mandatory 401a retirement savings plan. I also have the option to enroll in a 457b deferred compensation plan. 

Based on my current expenses and spending habits, I don’t think I could comfortably afford to max out both my 401a and Roth IRA accounts. Based on my understanding, general financial wisdom says to max out my Roth and then contribute as much as I can to my 401a. I’m trying to figure out if, while still maxing out my Roth, it makes sense to divide up my remaining contributions into the 401a and 457b deferred compensation. I had initially thought I’d throw it all into the 401a, but wonder if I’m missing something. Thoughts?

My wife and I are planning to file for divorce this month.

Afterwards, we'll file our taxes for the year of 2022. During that tax year we were still together, so would it be smarter to file married, filed jointly?

Currently, my wife is the only person that makes the money. I'm unemployed due to a medical condition and haven't been working for 5 months now. I don't want to file together with her if that means we'll both have to split the tax cost.

1105,1,"Hi PF community,

I am having an issue that I'm not sure how to resolve. 

In May of last year, I opened a zero-interest card from Wells Fargo to pay down my credit card debt. I'm recently graduated and finally have a healthy salary, so I'm trying to improve my financial health.

Having been a longtime lurker in this sub, I want to add for the record - I have never missed a credit card payment, I spend less than I earn, and I don't use this card at all. 

Now, here's the problem: Although I have a balance on my WF card of nearly $5,000 that I'm paying the minimum on each month, the funds were never actually dispersed to the credit card it was intended to pay off. WF has the correct card number and I've spoken to them \*many\* times over the last eight months, and still nothing. They just keep kicking it to a different office. The first time I spoke with them, they told me it would be a three-month investigation process. Eight months later, there's been no resolution -- and they haven't even tried to contact me. 

Today, I spoke with the executive office and they couldn't find a complaint. They did give me a case number long ago, but I didn't have it on me. After some research, they found that my complaint was never escalated to the appropriate office. So, not only have I had an additional $5k in debt on my credit report for the last eight months (which is obviously affecting my credit), they've completely mishandled this issue and I don't even know whether they've done any research or attempted to resolve this issue.

What should I do in this situation? I don't know who to ask because I'm embarrassed that I'm just starting to get my life on track financially at 32 (please be kind!). So I turn to you folks to provide any insight you have. Is it possible to just have WF cancel this debt? Or how should I approach this?

kindly,

1106,1,"Hello Everyone!

My wife and I are purchasing a house for the first time. We have 3 different mortgage options and we're looking for pro/cons on a few of them.

The house we are buying is $295k and we are putting 10% down.

Loan 1: 5.25% 30yr with a balloon payoff at 10yrs. PMI requires 15% Equity (rather than the standard 20%) and they are offering a HELOC to cover the last 5% down payment, so we wouldn't have any PMI.

Loan 2: Same lender as Loan one but is a 6.5% 30yr. PMI requires 15% equity and we can have a HELOC for the last 5% down payment, so no PMI.

Loan 3: 5.875% 30yr mortgage. PMI is est. $150/mth.

&amp;#x200B;

Not taking in account any early payoff / extra principal payments, the total cost of the loan would be:  
Loan 1: $522K  
Loan 2: $594K  
Loan 3: $541K

If we take in account early payoff (and paying the same amount on each loan each month, so once PMI is gone, that amount goes into extra principal payments), the total cost of the loan would be:  
Loan 1: $435K  
Loan 2: $551K  
Loan 3: $450K

Loan 2 clearly isn't the best option (no PMI doesn't offset the interest rate difference).

Loan 1 is the cheapest (lowest interest rate and no PMI) but it comes with the additional risk that if we don't refinance or move, we're stuck paying off the remaining balance in a balloon payment, but we get a low interest rate. Its also the loan that we would pay off the quickest.

Is the balloon loan a bad idea because of the added risk? Other people that have I consulted with have pretty mixed opinions.",Mortgage: Low Interest w/No PMI Balloon?

I've already dealt with extreme burnout for a long time; taking 5.5 years to graduate (barely) really took a toll on me, and not to mention all of it being for nothing since I couldn't even get a job after graduating.   Having to work for minimum wage just to pay off my student loan for a really hard degree that didn't do much for me is really just so mentally taxing I really just can't do it anymore.  

I've been applying to YCombinator and other VC firms and stuff but I'm not getting anywhere mainly because my app isn't done so I have no traction, but I'm just one guy trying to do it.   If I could financially sustain myself so I can focus all my time onto one thing and not have to split hours with a soulsucking service job then I would get it done and I am confident in that.  So I'm thinking: ""what is stopping me from just taking out a massive loan and gambling on myself?""  Like aside from a bank not being willing to give me a loan, for real what is stopping me?  Like my financial situation is already very bleak and I've already kind of committed a lot to this anyway.  

Like am I crazy for thinking thats a good idea? I've been trying to do anything else I can thats like a safe option but I'm mentally ready to risk it all at this point.  Just the ability to have a small pool of cash to pay myself for my labor and sustain myself would change my entire life for the better and I just feel like everything else I've been doing hasn't been working.  Is it a good idea to do something like that just to get me through this hump in my startup process?",Financially irresponsible to take out a loan for a startup?

I was never smart with money. the past few years I’ve been trying to fix the mess I’ve made ( I spent money as fast as I made it on nothing but crap, racked up CC debt etc). I stopped buying things and have paid off all my credit cards last year and bought a house. 

I make roughly $130k a year and am able to save 30-40k a year after taxes. I am a real estate agent on the side. 

My unions retirement sucks (belong to a union as a mariner). I’ve been in my union 6 years and only have 1.3 years of credit towards my retirement (I need to actively sail to get days towards retirement; ex: if I sail 4 months and have 3 months off the 3 off don’t count). 

My union does not offer a 401k. Only certain contracts within the union do and they are insanely hard to get. 

I have a house and by end of 2023 will have about 100k of equity. I started an IRA that I am making out every year. 

I’d like to leverage my equity into investments but have no idea whether I should put the $ into stocks/mutual funds/index funds or if I should buy some rental real estate or maybe try to do both? 

I’ve been researching and self educating but I’m at the point of information overload and am incredibly overwhelmed. 

I have a wife and 2 kids (2 years old and 10 months old). My wife does not work. I need to be able to retire for my wife and myself as well as put two kids through college in roughly 18 years. 

In the next 10-15 years I’d like to be in a position that I am not reliant on my career as a mariner. I am not saying I’d quit I just don’t want to be in this position where I am forced to work.  

I do recognize I am very fortunate compared to many who live paycheck to paycheck but I’d like to make a good situation better to be able to provide for my family.

1149,1,"Hi all, forgive my formatting in advance, I am on mobile.
 
I am 22F and have been at my current job out of college for just under a year, was making 50k and just got a raise to 58k. No debt. I live in a 1 br apt with my partner in a HCOL city. He works freelance in the film arena, and his income varies, so I feel the most comfortable making financial choices like housing with the assumption that I can pay everything on just my income, though he is usually able to contribute about 30% of household expenses. He could be doing more, but as my income is more stable, this has been what I have been the most comfortable with until this point.
 
Presently do not have a strict budget but I know I need to work that out. This last year was somewhat of an experiment as my partner quit his job in March to go freelance, and like I said, I did not want to count on his income to pay our bills, but now that we have gotten a clearer picture of his earning capabilities, I feel more comfortable relying on him for his income.
 
At this point my fixed costs are:

- $1,100 rent (Will be moving in July to something around $1600, where I live now is extremely unsafe and this is nonnegotiable).

- $250 car payment
- $100 utilities
- $200 gas
- $33 gym membership
- $760 6 mo car insurance premium that happens to be up for renewal this month (shopped around and unfortunately cannot find anything lower)
 
Whatever is left over I do spend frivolously, but I pay my CCs off in full monthly, though I am ready to sit down and build a budget. I guess I come to you all asking what can I be doing better, and am I super far behind? Any advice for budgeting?

I know the most obvious answer is save as much as possible and build a proper budget. I don’t need to look at the bank statements to know that most of my spending is on takeout, but I am currently learning to cook so that should be steadily falling. I know I absolutely have to decrease my spending to supplement the increase in my housing costs when the time comes. 

I have been feeling bad about my spending because I know it has been careless when my partner is able to contribute 50% to rent, I just blow that money. Again, I have no debt, but I am worried I am behind financially in terms of savings and retirement. 
 
As of now I am investing 10% of my income into a Roth 401k, and 1% into a traditional pretax 401k at the insistence of my parents – my mother feels like she is being screwed by having to pay enormous taxes on her traditional 401 not that she is retired, but I have seen on here that a Roth 401k isn’t always the right choice. 

Honestly, I am a secretary and honestly do not see my income in my lifetime go above 100k, but I am young and who knows where I will end up. No employer 401k match, but I believe after I have been with the company 2 years I receive a contribution at a percentage of my salary. That said, between those two accounts I have currently contributed around $2800. 

I also have an HSA with $2200 in it as of now, and pledged $3600 to that account this year, with a $700 employer contribution. I have about $2600 in a savings account as an emergency fund. 

I know I should open a Roth IRA, but I am not really clear on how that works. My employer 401k is through Vanguard, can I just open the account there, or would it be wiser to open an entirely new account through Charles Schwab? Am I in bad shape currently, and if so, what changes need to be made?

I have an STR (Short term rental) in Florida that I'm thinking of reselling it and putting it into a brokerage account and let the 7-10% compounded growth grow.

1153,1,"Hello personalfinanciers! I have always enjoyed the advice and insights from this sub and find myself in a place where I’m finally able to take stock of where I’m at and think a bit more long term about the future. And could really use some advice. 

First, some high level details:

Gross monthly: $8900

Monthly expenses:
-Rent: $767 (live with my partner in a shared home with friends)
-Home savings account: $1,116 (20% of net monthly)
-Utilities: ~$100
-Pension contribution: $575
-Roth IRA: $542 (yearly maximum)
-Car payment: $558 (more on this later)
-Car insurance: $114
-Phone bill: $72
-Vacation savings: $200
-Credit card: $2000*

*I treat my credit card like a debit card. I never carry a balance and always pay off my charges monthly. I group all other monthly expenses onto my credit card spending (like groceries, nights out, gym, shopping, etc). It gives me some peace of mind and flexibility so i’m not being too fastidious on every category. 

Assets:
-Index fund total: ~$15k
-Roth IRA: ~$17k
-Emergency fund: $17k (this covers the  basics like rent, utilities, and car payment for 6 months m)
-Home savings account: $7k
-Vacation account: $4k

Some context: I was finishing a PhD for all of my 20s (before PhD worked a canvassing job that paid shit). During my PhD, I made ~$30k/year. I started to save what I could in my Roth IRA starting in 2017, and managed to pay off all my undergrad student debt (about $38k) over the course of my grad studies (pretty proud of that!) The only debt i now have is my car payment, which I share with my partner. Our total monthly car payment is $810/mo at 2.94% interest. We have an agreement where we both contribute 10% of net pay, or $600/month, whichever is lesser. The rest of those contributions/money get rolled over into a joint savings account to be used for car related expenses. We own an electric vehicle so car maintenance should be low. 

In March of last year, I accepted a job at a state agency in WA where my salary was $80k. In October, a truly dream job opened in local city government doing what I focused my PhD on, and came with a $30k raise and better benefits. So really a win-win-win. Lots of room for advancement and I should max out my current classification in 2 years, which is a 4.5% raise/year. 

I’ve realized that - in part growing up working class and having a pathologically frugal father, and in part being a low-income earning graduate student - I am still living in a kind of “poverty mentality” where I have psychologically caught up to my new salary and spending power. I feel guilty taking vacations or indulging in myself, or like even the simple things like buying cocktails instead of well drinks when i go out every now and then. 

I live in a HCOLA and I would like to buy a house. I think i’m on track to do that in the next 5 years. While my partner and i aren’t married, I imagine we might be in the next few years (I can’t imagine life without him at this point). We don’t plan to have kids. 

How should I be shuffling my budget around? What should I do with my yearly raises? Promotions (very likely)? What should be some of my medium and long term goals?  

Thanks in advance and excited to see what y’all say",Financial planning advice as I turn 30: looking for feedback and insight on current approach!
1154,1,"TLDR at the bottom. 

I opened a new credit card to take advantage of a balance transfer promotion last year. I did 2 separate balance transfers, 1 at 0% interest and another at 6% interest (which was way better than the 26% I had been paying). I have been paying over 1k per month on a $180 minimum payment to get this paid off by the end of the promotional period. The 0% interest period ends 3/23 and the 6% interest period ends 10/23. 

What I just found out is that my payment does not apply to the transfer with the first promotional end date. It applies to the higher interest first. There is no way that I can make a payment directly to a balance transfer and I do not have the total remaining at this time to pay off. It is only 8k but unfortunately I just don't have it right now and won't have it before March. 

I would really like to avoid paying the 26% interest that is going to hit on that balance. I have great credit and am considering taking a low interest personal loan to pay that off and avoid high interest but my husband does not think this is a good idea to open another line of credit for that debt. 

We just bought a house and won't need a new car for over a year so I am not incredibly concerned about this affecting future large purchases or overall credit score. 

So, what is the best option for me here, taking the interest hit or trying to pay out the total balance with a new line of credit and taking on a lower interest for the total amount? Any advice on what I should consider is appreciated. 

TLDR: I misunderstood how balance transfer payments were working and am about to get hit with 26% interest on 3k.

What I'm planning on is taking the majority (75-80%) of my savings to transfer, leaving some in the initial low-interest account for emergencies and quick transfers (my checking and rent are part of the same bank I have the low interest acct with). 

Does moving that amount of money out of a long-standing account impact anything (earnings, credit score, etc) poorly, or is it all just a positive for me in the long run?

1178,1,"Hello everyone, happy new year.

I'm financial novice so I got myself into a messy situation with my ROTH IRA, that I started to contribute to in Vanguard in 2021. Some bullet points below on my situation for easier read

* 2021: Higher bonuses and low 401k contributions, resulted in a $140k AGI (my salary then was $123k) so only a partial contribution was available to me. I filed only recently (so very late) for the excess contribution so that's a hard pill to sallow for the 6% penalty but I'll be learning for that mistake
* 2022: New job with exactly $125k salary and maxed out 401k, so I'm hopefully anticipating my AGI would be lower that I could have contributed the full ROTH (question on this line of thinking below) but I will possibly have to recharacterize or withdraw
* 2023: Contributed a small chuck to my ROTH IRA already
* ROTH IRA Backdoor was not used in any of these situations

Hopefully the above points makes sense essentially, I am in the partial contribution range and will need to be more careful about how I contribute to my ROTH IRA. Some questions I have are:

* Am I thinking about my AGI correctly in that contributions to my 401k should help reduce my AGI so I could be eligible for the $6k ROTH IRA contribution (not counting the backdoor method)?
   * If so, should I wait for my W2 to start calculating my AGI?
* Lastly, with the portion I already contributed to my ROTH IRA for 2023, should I just go ahead and recharacterize that all to a Traditional IRA (I haven't purchased stocks) and go for a ROTH IRA backdoor from now on?

Any other thoughts on my situation are greatly appreciated. I'm pretty disappointed in myself for the negligence I had in managing my ROTH IRA account but am will to learn to my mistake and hopefully be better in the future.

1183,1,"I max out my Roth IRA (via Backdoor) and 401k (Traditional) every year. I used to work for a company where after-tax contributions were not allowed, so I stowed away some extra saved money in a regular taxable brokerage with Fidelity. I put in about $20,000, though with market conditions this account is now worth about $16,500.

My new employer does allow for after-tax 401k contributions and although I probably won't have a ton of extra money, I'd like to take advantage of any tax benefits I can. 

My thought is to sell my entire brokerage account, harvest the loss on taxes, then ""live off"" the $16,500 for the next few months while putting almost my entire paycheck into my 401k through traditional (as normal) and then after-tax with the in-plan conversion to Roth. I'd do this for a few months until I had about that $16-20K in the Roth portion.

Since I'm basically a long term set-and-forget investor, something feels bad about selling stock at a loss that I know would recover, but if I'm not taking it as cash and re-investing into similar holdings (total market index funds) I guess it's all the same.

* Is this a good plan? Any unexpected complications to be aware of? 
* Would wash sale rules apply? If I sold out the brokerage account would I need to wait to buy in through a different account with different rules? 

I also have a kiddo and a 529, I could just move the $16,500 directly into there. I wasn't planning on front-loading his college fund like this, but it would be a simpler way of making sure that currently taxable money ends up being non-taxable after growth, while still capturing some losses this year. I could shift his future college contributions to other vehicles later if we load him up now.

The other thing is that i've read time and time again that rather than do a mutual fund, maybe I should just dump it in S&amp;P or some comparable index fund as no mutual fund would outperform it.

1187,1,"Hi all,

I had a small 30 day missed payment on an account about a year ago (death in the family at the time it was suppsoed to be paid/thought it was on autopay), and decided to just take a long shot and write a goodwill letter and just see if it could get removed. I know the odds of it being granted was low, but figured it doesn't hurt.

Apparently, I was wrong? I saw my score tanked about 25 points and when I looked at the updates, it had the note ""Consuner disputes this account Information - Account previously in dispute now resolved by data furnisher"". At first I thought this was a promising remark, but given the reflected change in credit score, and the fact that the missed payment is still there, I'm thinking it's not. 

It seems there was some kind of misunderstanding, since I wasn't trying to dispute (and from my understanding- goodwill letters aren't a formal dispute). I made it pretty clear in my letter I was accepting the balance as my own, and the reasoning for the missed payment. Is this normal? Should I contact the credit bureau/ creditor and explain it wasn't a formal dispute and just s good will letter? Or is this just part of the process with good will letters?

The only other changes on my credit report were just balance decreases, so I can't imagine the decline in score was related to anything else.

Two years ago I had some mental health issues and for whatever reason I signed up for untold amounts of subscription based services during this time and stopped monitoring my spending. I usually put everything on my credit cards and at some point my credit card was put on lockdown by the credit card company because apparently the auto payments I had setup were bouncing back. So many of the recurring bills weren't going through. I had no idea or at least I wasn't paying attention.

Anyways over the last six months I paid off those cards, and started noticing all these bills from a ton of companies hitting the card. I did my best to go through my credit card activity, identify, and cancel all the recurring transactions I didn't need, because all those recurring bills started to hit my card once it was unlocked. There was probably 15+ recurring subscriptions that were hitting my card.

Should I contribute to a traditional IRA and scrap the idea of a backdoor conversion this year? Or do I do a backdoor conversion now and risk being open to pro rata at the end of the year (does it ever make sense to do this?)? Are there other options I’m not considering?

1207,1,"TIA for the help:

The information: Purchased a home last fall. Purchase price: $120k with $12k down. I took out a $160k mortgage at 5.25% as the house is in need of renovations. Monthly payment is $795. After closing costs, etc., the bank gave me a $24k check earmarked for said renovations. I had a family member give me $10k, leaving me with $34k in a savings account specifically for home renovations. My regular savings account currently has $15k.

Normally, I’d fund my investments via that $15k account. However, I haven’t yet as I’m undecided between doing just that and potentially needing it for my home renos. 

I’ve done much of the renovation myself thus far. However, I’ll soon have to bring outside contractors in for a small bath renovation and a kitchen renovation, hang new doors, trim, and a few minor things. Still need to buy appliances, cabinets, doors. 

My renovations account is currently sitting at $25,750, after I’ve purchased electrical materials, paint, flooring, etc.

I’m 29m, my base salary is $66k, am expecting $5-10k in OT this year but don’t want to rely on it. My job is pretty secure. No other debts. Just backed my 401k off to 15% versus the 25% it was at. Its balance is currently $22k. My Roth is at $16.5k, HSA - $6.2k, Rollover - $11.2k.


Apologies for this being a mumbled, structureless mess. In a bit of a hurry and just looking for some advice from those smarter than I. Would you take out more on your mortgage to fund the remaining renovations - to ensure funding your Roth and HSA? Or would you hold off on funding and try to leave mortgage as-is? - at the risk of not funding those accounts?

i made around $2,500 from a w-2 job, which i will obviously get a form for later. but most of my income was from self-employment in which i made around $19,583 this year from. i do not think i will even get taxed additionally from my w-2 job because i did not make enough in that job. 

this is the current math:

* As of right now, 19,583.50x0.9235= 18,085.36 is self-employment taxable income (without deductions and expenses)
   * Self employment tax rate: 18,085x0.153= 2,767.06
* As of right now, I made a net of less than 2,500, so earned income is less than standard deduction (approximately 12,000)

First, thank you in advance for all the generous and thoughtful responses.

I am 25 years old and currently a student with no source of income. My school disallows students from working their first semester of school. Though, I can work starting this semester. 

I have  about $18k in credit card debt from four cards. All cards have interest rates around 20%. These cards were taken out in 2019 to assist family during an extremely distressing time. I have made every minimum payment excluding December 2022 where I ran out of money due to law school living expenses. 

Also, I have and will continue to incur student loan debt for law school expenses. I estimate to have around $180k in law school debt by the time I graduate in 2025. I have no undergraduate debt or car loan debt. 

I am currently a law student at a T-14 school where I am supporting myself through grants given by the law school and federal student loans. I comfortably took out the loans knowing that top law school graduates, with hard work and perseverance, can attain jobs at private law firms making around $200k their first year. My long term career plan is to 
work at a big law firm to pay off debt and then return to my home state to serve as a public defender. 

I would need to earn $1,000-$1,500 a month to meet the monthly payments and my immediate reaction is just to get a job but am wondering if …

Instead of working a part-time job in law school and losing time toward professor relationship development, independent research, and networking —should I declare bankruptcy now? 

If I work a part-time job, I won’t have time to join a journal, be involved in affinity groups, participate in moot court AND still make time to study diligently to get the best grades possible to maximize my employment outcomes.  

How would bankruptcy affect future employment in law firms and the government?

1255,1," Hi everyone,

I'm an 18 year old male and I have a lot of business ideas that I want to try, but I'm having trouble getting started. I need to earn the first few thousand dollars to get things off the ground, but I just can't seem to make it happen.

I've tried a few different things, but nothing seems to be working. I know I should get a job and go that route but I have proof of concept with my ideas and really struggle with the idea of getting a job.

I don't view myself as lazy or undisciplined. I get at least an hour of exercise a day, I eat well, and I love working on entrepreneurial things. I just cannot get the first few K's to get started with anything serious. This is slowly making my parents grow bitter as I am now 6 months into being 18 and still haven't got a job or gone to college.

How would you recommend I get started? Is there side hustles I can do to earn the $3-4k or should I force myself to get a job? What advice do you have for someone like me who is struggling to get started?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and consideration.",Need advice on how to make first few K's

My company offers an effective 5% match I believe and something like a half match on the next 3% after that.  So essentially I do an 8% contribution before tax to a 401K each month to take full advantage of that. 

In addition I have zero housing costs currently as I live with family rent free, and no healthcare premium as well as my plan takes care of basically everything. Now here’s what I do have.

1264,1,"Hello everyone quick question, 

I have been a bit in a tight spot financially so I requested to do a partial payment on 
My car bill this month. It requires me to pay a portion up front and the remainder next month. 
A few days ago the partial payment was pulled from my bank account. Yesterday 1/4/2023 the same establishment charged me AGAIN, however for the full monthly car payment. 
I called the car financing agency and they told me to have my bank stop the pending payment which I did as of noon 1/4/2023. 

I work overnight and pulled up my bank account to see if my balance was back to normal and it’s definitely not. I have a lot of transactions missing and I’m now in the negative. I’m assuming that it’s still processing the changes?

1265,1,"I have a 2018 Hyundai Elantra with 25000 miles on it. I bought it new and I'm just 6 months away from paying it off. I was planning to keep this car for another 5 years but after a break-in last week I found out that this model doesn't have an immobilizer and is very easily stolen. I was very lucky that the thieves were scared off by my neighbor and left the scene after breaking a window. I got a steering wheel lock to deter future thieves but I am still concerned about more break-ins and higher insurance premiums and lower resale value. Having to put a steering wheel lock every time I park is not fun either.

I was checking KBB and CarMax and seems like I might be able to get $14000 to $15000 If I sell this car then I would have to buy another one (maybe a Corolla or Civic, for $22000 to $27000 depending on trim) and I know that the prices for used and new cars are high right now.

Mechanically speaking this car is pretty reliable and I don't really need a new car right now.

Right now I'm living paycheck to paycheck until I manage to get over the hump of late Rent payments once I'm steadily working. I had a job at Amazon from Aug up until Nov before I resigned. I had taken a 1.5 month LOA for Mental Health reasons which led to manic spending, constant buying of food/drinks via Postmates, and loss of payments from SDI because my Dr. Said they weren't in the system and we didn't have all the right records and paperwork since I had contacted her way too late into the LOA. So I lost around $2500 of income due to that. Once I came back to work I ended up feeling physically incapable and mentally incapable of continuing working there with all this money due here and there looming over me, losing money to Ubers to work since it was far away from me, and just not feeling the right support from coworkers saying I'm just trying to not work and all that despite all my issues, mental, physical, or otherwise. I was physically hurting myself everyday at work to the point of near incapacitation once home. It was just like stress overload.

So during all this I ended up forgoing any payments to credit accounts due to either being too broke or focusing solely on rent and borrowed money from friends/family. I had a chronic spending problem putting most of my credit towards my gaming PC and its upgrades, a gaming laptop, a new phone, another new phone, a new E-Bike i never used because in my area none of the apps support it for delivery purposes and because of that mental health problem and low physical health I never got around to using it for any reason (I'm now selling it), lots of foods, snacks, drinks, and just anything that kept me any form of entertainment. Everything piled up, late fees, interest, etc. Until it was too much for me.

I've thought of Bankruptcy but I'm not entirely sure how to go through that and what it entails. I'm in CA if that makes any difference. I'm now working at Walmart as mentioned making $17/hr and just recently on Dec 17 and on Dec 23 contracted COVID from work and had to take a COVID Leave which I'm just now getting off of and can return to work on the 6th according to my doctor. I got paid for 4 scheduled work days + 4 days of COVID which amounted to around $950 after taxes and some of that went to automatic payments towards my Moneylion Loan, MoneyLion Instacash Advance, and some other Advance Apps as well as a Dr Appointment, Uber rides, and some light groceries leaving me with around $600. And I currently owe $750 Rent for Dec + $100 Utilities, $75 Late Fee, $750 Rent for Jan, and upcoming receipt of my Utilities due on the 15th. 

Thankfully I worked with my landlord and can pay them when I get my next paycheck in 2 weeks which should hopefully be a lot bigger this time around since it will include some of my COVID Pay and more work days. However I've also looked at Rental Assistance in the off chance I can get assistance for coverage instead of deleting my entire paycheck in one go just to live here.

So what now? How do I go about repairing my situation and raising my score? I uses to have a 760-780 score back when I was /r/churning and didn't even have a job at the time and ended up with super high limit cards with Amex. Though they ended up lowering them severely when I put them under a payment plan and they never reverted it once I canceled the payment plan. If I had all 3 cards at full credit I could have basically put all my other debt combined into just those 3 cards and even my main Chase card before they cut that limit too. But I wasn't thinking of that at the time.",Rescuing my credit. What do I do?

However, the builder’s incentive was pretty good imo so we decided to pull the trigger. It’s a 2023 new built in a location that we like to be in. 30 yrs fixed @ 4.99%, they give us $13,000 to pay for closing cost (which should cover all of it);  appliances also included for free (approx. $5000 in value). With that said, our out-of-pocket is expected to only be the 5% down payment.

As the title suggests, I screwed up big on my ROTH IRA contributions from 2021 as I revisited my 2021 filing and discovered my AGI was $140k so I was only eligible for a partial contribution. I understand now I am well past the deadline and would be subject to the 6% tax penalty which is per year so long the excess remains in the ROTH IRA. Some questions I was hoping to get guidance for:

* From Vanguard, do I  recharacterize the contribution or simply remove it?

1316,1,"Preface: I know next to nothing about cars.

Our 2012 Subaru Forest unfortunately has blown a head gasket. This is the second used car in three years to need a new engine. This time around, the warranty/service contract was sooo close to covering the fix, but I would be responsible for the $2,000 engine tear down to even confirm that it is something covered under the warranty. If it ended up being covered- great but, that's still $2,000 more I'm in the hole as opposed to $3,000 to just get it fixed out of pocket.

So, we're looking at trading toward something else. I've never bought a new car before, and I'm pretty tired of being burned by used purchases.

Is it foolish for a financially struggling person to buy a new car? I've always felt like new car = luxury item, but having learned of the 100% warranty coverage I'm considering this option for the first time.

 I understand as long as you keep up with the service schedule, every single thing you could think of (except windshield damage, wrecks, and external factors) would be covered and paid for by the warranty for the first 5 years at which point it switches  to a 3rd party lifetime warranty.

 I cannot handle finding myself in this situation again in a year or two years.

The payment's looking like $400 more a month than I'm currently paying which, if I follow my budget, should result in still saving (but considerably less per month). I still owe about $6,000 on the Subaru, so couple that with the need of a new engine, and you can see how trading it in gets me peanuts for it.

Between my last two used car purchases, I've honestly spent enough on service and repairs for a pretty sizable down payment on something new.

And of course, if I go this route, expenses are going to have to cut waaaay back.

It's not really a question of **can I do it**, more so - is it a smart move in the long run?

1323,1,"To keep things relatively short and sweet, I had a bit of a rough start financially. A combination of low-paying jobs, sporadic gig work, irresponsible credit usage, and unpaid medical bills absolutely tanked my credit score all the way down to 558.

This morning, I paid off all of my delinquent credit (nine delinquent accounts). I kept careful records while paying them off and got receipts in case they do not fall off my report as they should. 

The only things remaining on my credit report are a student loan with a balance of $13,000 (all payments on time and up to date) and an AcceptanceNow loan on a laptop that I bought last year that still has about $900 left to pay off (all payments on time and up to date). 

I currently make $50,000 a year and am paid weekly. My take home pay after insurance, 401k, HSA, and federal tax (no state tax in this state) deductions is about $786.00 per week. We get a fluctuating profit-share bonus around the 15th of each month (usually between $100 and $400). My job and company are very stable and I intend to stay indefinitely. I just received a $5/hr raise to $25/hr and have been told to expect another ""significant"" (no idea) raise later this year (Decemberish).

I live at home with my parents and am paying $350 a week in a combination of rent and other miscellaneous bills. Every other week, I pay AcceptanceNow $186. My parents currently pay my student loan ($160 per month) and have stated that I don't need to worry about paying it until my finances are in order again.

I desperately want to start increasing my credit score. I'm not sure how much paying off those nine accounts will help and I'm not sure how to best start building it back up again. I would also like to move out of here and get a house of my own within the next few years, if at all possible. I'm 29, turning 30 this month.

I will spare the details but unfortunately I have no way to contact that person again to correct this with their bank and they already confirmed to me that the request for transfer has been made.

The payment will still work by using ABA number instead of ACH number but just take longer?

Me and my friend have both lived at home all of college and are ready to move out. What I’m trying to figure out now is if it’s better to rent a place for a year or two or live at home for a few more months and try to save the 3.5% down payment and closing costs for an FHA loan, while leaving some money for an emergency fund. I know rates are crazy right now and aren’t likely to come down for a bit, but is owning a home and building equity a better decision than renting? I feel like a mortgage is roughly the same as rent these days, property taxes are the only thing that worries me. 

I bought my car in cash and my only payments are for my phone and student loans (27k total, 19k being federal loans around 2-4%). At the moment, I have around 5k in cash and 17k invested in retirement accounts. My goal for the next few months is to build up my cash savings and then move out. 

Note: either decision would be splitting rent/mortgage with roommate (1 atm but that could change)

Are there any glaring things I’m failing to consider?

I have a Rollover IRA from a previous employer, the account was initially setup as a Traditional 401k, it is not of significant value. I made my 6k contributions in 2022 bringing it to under 15k. My mistake being that I assumed an IRA was an IRA, when in fact I believe I should have put my 6k last year into a Roth IRA. This year I will be getting married and our combined income will be over the \~250k Roth contribution limit.

If I understand this correctly, I can continue to contribute to my Rollover IRA, but I am now not able to setup and contribute to a Roth IRA due to combined income?

I am aware of, but somewhat unclear on the backdoor option, and not sure if it’s something I should pursue? I could convert my Rollover to a Roth, but that will come at a significant tax cost given our combined income? Could I alternatively add the 6.5k to my Rollover and then covert that to a Roth IRA without a tax hit? Should I avoid all that and just keep submitting to my Rollover? Is there any point in opening up a traditional IRA and submitting to that instead of the rollover?

Then today an insurance agency I spoke with last week who I didn't hear back from finally emailed me with slightly lower quotes from Farmers and Nationwide. Now I've been reading LOTS of negative reviews on Progressive especially on how they handle repairs or following through with claims. So here are my 3 questions...

1. Would switching over to **Farmers** or **Nationwide** when I just switched to Progressive have any negative consequences to my premium? Keep in mind this would mean I'd be jumping carriers twice in one week. There wouldn't be a gap in coverage as I would purchase the new policy before canceling.   

2. Is Progressive as bad as everyone says? And if so, would the move to Farmers or Nationwide provide me with a better company to depend on for claims involving repairs and hopefully never, a total loss valuation?
3. Am I better off just sticking with Progressive for the remainder of the term (6 months) and switching when it's closer to renewal? FYI, the 6 month term was paid in full to Progressive yesterday so I'd have to wait for a refund if I cancel. If you recommend I switch later, which of the two would you say is the better carrier between **Farmers** and **Nationwide**?

I can understand why banks have this, and I understand that this may be seen as a benefit for some (maybe even most) people; but, I personally hate it. In fact, the reason that I reported the debit card as lost was solely because I didn't want that old subscription service to be able to charge me anymore.

Do other banks have this issue, or is this just Chase? Is there a bank that I can sign up with that will prevent merchants from charging against a cancelled debit or credit card?

If all other banks suffer from this issue, what options do we have for cutting off subscription services that are difficult to cancel?

1389,1,"Hello all,

I just turned 26 some months ago and have gone through roughly 3 years of irresponsible spending due to getting my first higher paying job, me being me, the COVID pandemic, and depression which I am now getting treated. 

This past 2022 was the 3rd, and I want it to be the final, year that I completely wipe out my bank account at the end of the year due to poor planning. I'm tired of it and really want to start buckling down. Even though I'm 26, I feel like I'm 22/23 financially if that makes sense lol.

My weekly take home pay is 868.37 which is 3475.48 monthly

I currently pay 700 in rent. I have a really awesome housemate who makes quite a bit more than me and decided to split the rent fairly as opposed to evenly, which I really appreciate. I do live in California, so rent is definitely on the high side, and I'm not banking on living with my housemate forever. We both gotta live our lives, even if it requires moving out, which is also a motivator for getting my shit together.

I try to save 500 monthly, and I was doing a pretty good job last year until depression really hit, and I just wrecked everything so I'm starting from nearly 0.

As far as payments go, I've been tackling CC debt which is around 7K and expect to have it paid off by the end of the year. I have 35.5K in student loans and while I qualify for Biden's forgiveness program, I'm absolutely not banking on that since it seems unlikely it will happen. I'm not focusing on putting money into that and instead I want to use the remainder of the payment pause to clear as many CCs as possible.

The rest of my monthly payments including utilities and subscriptions total around 400 - 500. I'm currently rounding up all subscriptions and closing any I don't need and switching the ones I can to yearly payments since they're cheaper and eliminate annoying monthly payments. 

My goal for this year is to pay off all my CC debt while figuring out how to save money and where to put it which is what I mainly need help with. I mostly have the CC repayment figured out. 

I have 4 CCs  with significantly lower balances, so I'm starting off with a snowball method and once those are done (I actually already have two paid off!) I will switch to avalanche for the rest, since they're pretty much maxed out or close to being maxed out. 

As far as saving money goes. My plan was to continue saving 500 per month during the snowball period, making weekly payments to the CC I choose to pay, with any remaining money at the end of the week going into said CC to pay it off faster. Once the avalanche period starts I plan on switching and putting 500 a month into the card I'm paying off as opposed to my savings with any remaining money at the end of the week going into my savings as to not neglect that. 

The issue with my savings is that I want to be able to put some of my them/ invest them into something meaningful that would actually benefit me in the long run even up to retirement age while also keeping part of my savings on deck like in a basic savings account in the event that I need to pay for a sudden large expense (like if my car breaks down). My employer does offer a 401K but the only issue is that I think at the moment I would prefer to get as much take home pay as possible to wrestle down my debt, and have more control over how much money goes where as opposed to having the money somewhere I can't necessarily touch it. If there are any alternatives, I would appreciate any advice. I'm not sure if my best bet would be to just keep putting my savings in a basic account with my bank while tackling my debt and finding a way to invest it once I have more breathing room.","Advice for 26yr old that is finally starting to buckle down financially?

Unfortunately at the end of August the high risk specialist I was seeing thought I was going into pre-term labor and had me admitted to the hospital. I had met my deductible by this point and while I was there a financial advisor came by to review my personal info and my insurance. 

She reviewed the hospital bill and showed that with my insurance it would be ~$500.

I did not receive any of the financial paperwork with my discharge paperwork.

1424,1,"A few years ago I got scammed into a PACE loan for a home improvement project (energy efficient attic insulation thingy). I had just bought my house and was a first-time homeowner and didn't know any better. The guy who sold me on it did some very nice sleight-of-hand where he would point out the low 2.99% interest rate on the PACE loan and the fact that it would be paid off through my yearly property tax bill, while never mentioning that with all the fees and additional costs they charge, the *effective* interest rate was closer to 11%. When I recently went back through the paperwork and saw that I really kicked myself for going ahead with it. 

But apart from the actual loan amount that I owe (about $8500 left to pay) this loan has cost me probably tens of thousands of dollars indirectly. Back when interest rates were at their lowest, I wanted to refinance to save myself some money but had forgotten about this loan. Turns out I got several offers for a full 1.5% reduction in my fixed interest rate on my mortgage (dropping down from 3.99 to 2.49). But everyone told me they couldn't do it as soon as they discovered I had a PACE loan, which turns out counts as a lien on the property. That really whistled my pickle.

Another super annoying thing that happened: last year the dumbasses doing escrow review at my lender fucked up and did not calculate the amount for the loan that was in my property tax bill. So what happened *this* year? Right, a big escrow shortage resulting in a $400 per month increase in my mortgage for the rest of 2023 to make up for it. I know it'll settle down next year probably but that still pisses me off.


So I want to pay off this loan and saw that they take credit card payments (with no additional fee). I did some churning a while back so the question that immediately popped into my head was, ""Why can't I just apply for new card that has a 0% introductory APR for, say, 15 months (those are a dime a dozen) and pay it off with that? Heck, I'm seeing a lot of these cards have $200 to $400 welcome bonuses, no annual fees, and some of the better ones are 2x points on all purchases with no limit. I can just divide the balance by 15 and pay that amount monthly to pay off the loan interest free. I do not anticipate I'll have any issues making the payments.

While this seems like a no-brainer to me, my question is: is there anything that might prevent me from doing this? I'm thinking for example of something like there being limitations on what kind of credit card purchases qualify for a 0% APR on the new card. I've never heard of anything like that but I want to make sure my plan has no holes in it. I don't want to be opening a new card for no reason. Or might there be anything that I'm not considering that would make this a bad deal?",Pay off PACE loan with credit card?

I have a cleaning service that does a full clean every other week and a local landscaping company care for the yard.   


My sources of income are disability insurance through my previous employer for 2/3 of previous gross pay and VA disability compensation for 70% under appeal to get me to 100%.

I will be owed back compensation from the VA if I win my appeal.

Given how quickly my ability to care for myself is going downhill, I have started looking into in-home assistive care.   


I don't have enough assets to normally even think about a trust, but the trust seems like a good idea. The trust can pay for my care while I am alive and then have the kids inherit anything in the trust when I pass. When the VA pays the back pay, I can wipe out the debt and have the trust purchase a handicapped accessible house for me that the kids could sell once I pass.

1438,1,"Greetings!

I live in the US, and feel I am facing a dilemma. I know this is a question many have asked in some form or another, but basically I am worried my older car could break down/become prohibitively expensive sometime in the next few years. Here are the details:

I own a 2013 Chevy Equinox with just over 150,000 miles on it. I own the car in full, no loans on the vehicle. Besides regular maintenance (oil changes, tires, etc) the only major expense I have incurred so far was the alternator failing last year. So I am currently averaging about $700-800/year in vehicle upkeep, plus $1500-2000/year on gas.

Looking at used cars, I cannot find many Equinoxes with more mileage than mine. That has me worried that I am nearing the end-of-life stage of the vehicle. With that in mind, is it worth it to trade it in soon for a new car? 

I would be trying to get a Bolt EUV. If I can avoid dealer markups it would be a $30k car, $5k down payment, and I would guess $5k trade in based on the used pricing being $8-12k for cars similar to mine. The IRS says the 2023 EUV qualifies for the current EV tax credit of $7500, so by next tax season end I would get back my down payment + sales tax, and I would have a car I know will last at least 5-10 years reliably.

Summary of costs:

Current Equinox - $2800/year, could spike in price
 
Bolt EUV - ~$5000/year loan, &lt;$500/year operating costs","Trade-in vehicle while it still has value, or wait and risk vehicle death at unknown time?"

My parents are well off financially but never taught any of this information to their kids and I never had the chance to learn it in the school system because I was homeschooled. 

My gross income is $35,763 annually and my net is $29,097. 

I currently pay 5% towards my 401k and my company's match is as follows ""The company matches $0.20 to your account for every $1.00 you contribute, up to the first 5.00% of your eligible compensation."" 

So for every dollar I contribute, which is about $174 a month, my company contributes 20 cents. Which usually comes out to around $34 a month or $408 a year. 

So annually, including my companies contribution, I contribute $2,496. 

This seems incredibly low to me but here are my monthly finances:

&amp;#x200B;

Rent: $285-$350 (depending on the electric bill for that month) 

Groceries: $200

Gym: $12 

Theme park annual pass: $86

Car Insurance: $90

Car Payment: $175 

Health Insurance: $170

I feel like I am barely surviving. Everything I read says to put more towards retirement but I can't afford to do that. Where I live is incredibly hard to find a job. The only reason my rent is affordable is because I own a house with my fiance and he pays the mortgage while I pay the utilities.

Our hope has also been once we start a family (3-4 year timeline) that I can leave my job to become a stay at home mother.

I have an investment (not tax advantaged or a retirement account) that I bought before I had any debt, and I could liquidate it today (at a loss) and pay off the debt instantly. Or, I could keep the investment, and cash-flow the debt for a few years (having optimized for budget and spending already), but my calculations show that the interest expense to do so would be nearly identical to the realized loss I'd see by selling today. 

So while I'd get the ""immediate guaranteed return"" equal to the debt's interest rate, I'd also be realizing a loss, so does that in effect make it a wash? Not really sure how to frame that in my thinking, or if it's even relevant. I suppose I would get to write-off that loss on my taxes for the next couple years. 

Generally, this investment isn't something ""that fits my thesis"" anymore either (as the smart folks would say), that is to say, I wouldn't buy it today given what I know, though I believed in it when I did. It could of course go up, liquidating it could be a lost opportunity, or dumping it now could prevent me from realizing a total loss.

Questions I’d love some insight on…

**Buying a house / What to do with our cash**

We were holding onto the cash in the hopes of buying a house soon, like asap. I even lowered my 401k contribution to get more cash in the last few months. However, any decent house in the area is 1.2m+ and the 110k cash we have saved is just not enough. Even with the housing prices coming down, due to the high interest rates, buying a house doesn’t seem like a possibility any time soon. 

So the question is, should we continue to hold onto our cash but put it into HYSA so we can guarantee usage in a year or two? Or give up on the idea of house and put most of it into the market considering the market is low now? I’m not necessarily trying to time the market, we’d likely end up DCAing it over a few weeks. I’ve reset my 401k contributions to max as of 1/1/2023.

I have been deferring my gratification for 10years since I moved here as an immigrant. On all those years, I was working full-time, going to school full-time, even had part-time jobs, unpaid internships. As immigrant, I help (until now) support my parents/family. I was not really able to travel,  or buy much luxury

Fast forward to present, we are now financially stable. I have a good career, have savings, investments, etc. I still have minimal debts (all 0% I knooow). In the past year, I have been traveling. I have traveled more that year than those 10years of my life. I am enjoying it while doing my other hobbies as well. It feels good to just focus on work and my interest, without worrying about school and making extra income. I am thankful to my past self for making those sacrifices. Being jealous on my peers going on vacations and buying new cars etc. Those years I was working, I didn’t save much (but still did) since I was helping out family. 

Now, I am in a good spot in life. But, personal finance is still in my radar. I noticed I’ve been gone and my apt’s empty, also been on my plans before I started traveling. So I have also done my research and asked people. I know I will still be traveling. So I thought I should buy a duplex so other half is paying at least. But of course there are vacancy issues etc, so I want to have more buffer. I am 31, single, and feels like I have so much to catch up so I don’t want to pause  my traveling really.

1500,1,"I have regularly done backdoor roth ira for the past 5 years. I have one traditional IRA and one Roth IRA account with TDAmeritrade (and no other IRAs with any other providers). I have never made any pre-tax contributions to traditional IRA, nor have I converted any pretax money from my 401k to IRA. I deposit after-tax $6000 (or yearly max limit) to my traditional IRA and convert the same amount to Roth IRA once the funds become available for transfer.  However, I have accumulated a small amount of interest in my traditional IRA (less than $0.50) which I believe is the interest earned during the time my (backdoor Roth) funds stay in traditional IRA before being converted to Roth. The TDAmeritrade allows converting full account or a specific amount.

1. Should I convert full account (including that small sum of &lt; $0.50) while doing Roth conversion? Does that trigger any pro-rata rules, or have any other tax reporting implications? 

2. If yes, does the pro-rata rules apply to my 401k accounts also, since I have both pre-tax and Roth 401k balances?

Our plan is to have a conversation with them about what that will actually look like when the baby is here but for context: I've been in-depth walked through their financial set-up as part of estate planning and believe this is extremely realistic.

We'd conservatively planned \~$200k of college savings for each of our planned 2 children (invested, 6% return) and planned to supplement out of pocket for the rest of the costs. We hope that our kids will attend public university in our HCOL state that has a great university system, the same as we did and 3 of our 4 parents did. Kids will attend also public school through high school.

The issues — it's very difficult to know what college will actually cost in 18-25 years, and that alone makes me unsure enough to not depend only on grandparent contributions. Also, the addition of the those contributions could be the difference between our children being able to to go whatever school they want versus sticking with our plans of public university (though I'd still strongly encourage lower education costs).

TLDR — in-laws said they'll pay for college but we want to ensure that we're saving for our childrens' future too. How would you approach? A living trust funded via brokerage accounts (over a ESA/529)?",Planning for kids college when grandparents say they'll pay?
1506,1,"I started my current job back in June, since then my 401k with their provider John Hancock has kicked in.  I do also have a 401k with Fidelity from my previous employer, where I have about $12k there.  So I'm trying to decide if I leave my previous 401k where it is, roll it over to an IRA, or rollover to John Hancock.  Here are some more details:

Fees with current Fidelity account:

* Annual plan level fee is 0.11% of plan's assets
* 0.13% of account balance per year deducted quarterly for advisor fee
* Additional fees from within investment funds

My current company has a free Financial Advisor to help with anything 401k (only with John Hancock), so he looked into this all for me and he's estimating I'm likely paying about 2% yearly on my Fidelity balance, so about $240.  Whereas John Hancock would be just shy of 1% - which varies based on investment options.

Honestly, this all confuses me beyond belief and a financial advisor giving me this info only confused me more. 

The biggest benefit I see to rolling over my Fidelity 401k to John Hancock is that I would have access to this financial advisor to advice on investments, etc. based on my total balance.  However, I hear Fidelity is just a better option than John Hancock, which I why I lean towards leaving it there - but do I rollover to an IRA?  If so, I know nothing about IRAs - I'm assuming I'd need to do a lot of the investment decisions myself then, etc.

For reference I'm 24M and got married in 2022. This review covers my income and spending this year, along with my thoughts on what I did wrong and can improve on. It is excluding my wife who spends about the same as me but makes 20% more than me. This is a long post, in hindsight I'm not sure how popular it will be, but I enjoyed writing it and I think it helps me to see it written out and motivates me to be better. Hopefully it can help others as well.

Breakdown of the linked pic:

* Total income: $96k
* Total taxes: $11k (doesnt include any returns)
* Net income: $84k
* Total Spending: $62k
* Net Income - Spending: $22k

Note: the monthly income is high in mid summer as I started a new job but stayed with my old job for a couple months. I am thinking of going back part time this coming summer to increase my income again. 

This year was a big year for me, some purchases include:

* $15k for half my wedding/honeymoon
* $5k down payment on a new car
* $3k on office supplies for my wife and I's new WFH job
* $20k or $1700/month for half the mortgage, utilities, car payment and insurance

Note: This may explain my high spending, but I am worried about the other $20k on misc that I haven't tracked (mostly amazon, traveling, and food) is very high and may increase. Hopefully 2023 has less large purchases and can shift an additional $20k into savings/investments. Other than knowing my big purchases and investing 20% automatically I have no actual budget. 

&amp;#x200B;

||Year Starting|Year Ending|Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Savings (Cash)|$13,296|$12,295|$(1,002)|
|Retirement/Brokerage|$6,442|$30,420|$23,978|
|Debt (Student loan/Car)|$(19,689)|$(39,430)|$(19741)|
|Net worth|$49|$3284|$3235|

&amp;#x200B;

Note: This graph above shows a breakdown of my cash, retirement, and debt to gather my net worth. As my first year working full time I'm happy to increase my net worth, but given how much I made a total increase of $3235 or just 4% of my take home pay seems really low. On the flip side my cash/retirement increased almost $23k in one year. Which is more than 20% of my income, so I am happy with that.

Goals for 2023:

* Cut spending by 30% down to $42k (is this still too high for my age/income?)
* Increase Savings/Emergency fund to $20k
* 40% of my income into my retirement accounts
* Increase salary - Get promoted, could be difficult as I'm only 6 months in.
* 3 one week destination vacations

Notes: I feel like I'm setting tough goals for myself, but realistically achievable if I keep with it. I aspire to FIRE and want to be better. I believe if I push myself enough I can get promoted this year, but I only have 6 months of experience and no degree (I'm in finance), so this may be an unachievable goal. The last goal is a reminder that I don't want to be all work and no play. My vacations don't have to be expensive, but I want to set the goal and time to get out of the house and relax. 

Overall I'm new to having money, I always thought I was good at saving. But it turns out I'm really good at spending.

What do you all think? Is my spending insane? Should I set a real detailed budget, if so any recommendations on resources to help? Is dropping by 30% even enough? Let me know if you have any pointers, advice, or comments.","2022 Income and Spending Review, Am I spending too much?"

I have stats and numbers that I could show to justify the raise but don't want to come off as arrogant because the stats FAR exceed my peers. (It's blatantly obvious what my numbers are, so don't want to ""Show off"" per say) This also goes to say that I'm not anything special. This company would thrive without me still.

I’d like to start off by saying I have been terrible with money for years. I’m 24, about to be married, and making about $2000 a month (She makes about $1700/month). I don’t parents anymore, and when they were around they were terrible with money as well. Recently got back on my ADHD medication along with others that have help me turn my life around.

1535,1,"Hello! Just as a pre-requisite, I lurk here and have done searches, but I have some anxieties about upcoming life changes that I'd like some thoughts about.

I accepted a job back in August that requires me to move to the greater Seattle area. They gave me plenty of time to move, and I'll be moving soon.

I currently enjoy MCOL-LCOL, and even here I have chosen to spend a little more to get a good social/walkable apartment location . ~$1800/mo 1 bed.


As for finances (the important part):

I'm 23, single, dog owner, no student loans, no debt (minus car payment)

My base salary is ~160k, bonus eligible (usually 10-20% per year) + yearly RSUs (~$30k/yr)
I should note that my compensation was decided on the fact that I will be moving to Seattle, so nothing will change. If I chose to stay it would have been less.

I'm currently maxing 401k, HSA, and my company's Stock Purchase Plan.


I use YNAB so my view into my spending/bills is pretty easy.

My monthly take home after taxes/contributions is ~$7k.

I pay $1100/mo for my car (including insurance/gas)
I have no credit card debt, student loan debt, or retail loan debt (i.e. phone financing etc)

I budget $500/mo for my dog (whatever is left over goes to a fund for potential medical expenses)

Utilities/Bills usually total around $400 (absolute max)

Admittedly I'm a bit of a spendy person when it comes to going out/eating out, but that's by choice and is entirely malleable and can be reduced at a whim.
Last month I spent $1000 on eating out/going out


Onto where I'm conflicted. Moving to a HCOL area obviously will cost more. 

I'm thinking I should pay $3k/mo for rent + parking, but I'm not sure if that's excessive (or i could be affording more?)
I won't live with roommates as I have personal issues that make it incredibly difficult to share a space. I'm fairly young, single, and would like to be socially active, so I'm ready to pay a premium to be ""in it"" so to speak.

I'm assuming as I get older and potentially find a partner, my living requirements will change.

1536,1,"I bought my house a bit over two years ago for $475k. I refinanced during peak Covid and got my rate reduced. It's an FHA 30-year fixed rate mortgage locked in at 2.375%.

I work from home full-time now and, frankly, I'm wondering why I live in the city. I'd like to move across the country to Maine (from Portland, Oregon), but I'm not to keen on getting a new mortgage at 6.5% or whatever the new rate is currently. I can get so much more for my money out east.

I'm curious what my options are? I've been reading about mortgage porting, allowing you to essentially keep your current terms and move into a new property, but I just got off the phone with my lender and she doesn't think that's possible with an FHA loan. Damn, it seemed like such a great option...

I've also thought about getting a second mortgage and renting this house out. I make $155k/year, so I think I'd be able to afford a second mortgage if I'm able to rent out this one. But, I guess that's a whole thing, too, because I would need to rent out my house before I can get the second loan or at least have a lease signed?

Do I have any other options or will I just have to sell, get a new mortgage, and refinance once rates come back down?

I have about $50k that I could put down on a new home and another $200k in the bank that I'd rather not touch, if that opens up any additional avenues.","I want to move, but I have a great APR. What are my options?"

1550,1,"Hi all!

I don't have a *ton* of debt. I've balance transferred debt from a few cards and kept paying it off, and my credit score is around 730 at the moment.

I have $5,000~ between two cards from balance transfer deals that have 0% APR until December this year.

I have $4,500 on a card that has 18%~ APR (AmEx). The thing is, I'm in the middle of moving in with my partner (saving money after the move also), so money is really tight. I have good habits - most of the debt was from medical bills that balance transfers helped me from accruing interest while paying it off (started with close to $18k~).

Is a loan from a place like Upstart worth paying off the 4.5k~ card that has APR on it? I went through the process and my loan for 5K would have 10% APR - which makes sense hypothetically to move forward with. In addition - with us moving in together, we have our security deposit + other moving fees to pay.

Is it dumb for me to apply for a $6K loan at 8-10%, use most of that for my 18% APR balance and pay it off, and the rest for moving costs? And then of course the focus becomes paying off the 0% APR balance transfer debt - but obviously the interest debt comes first.

Any thoughts here? I have a good 401K that I contribute my max too - don't want to take a loan from that.. but I have no clue if that's better...

I'm not understanding the situation very well and I'm asking for insights from people who have gone through this. This is for 2022, and I'm preparing my paperwork to do the taxes. 

In short:
1) In January 2022, I contributed $6,000 to my Roth IRA (on Vanguard).
2) By the end of the year, my annual income is way above the Roth IRA contribution limit. 
3) Called Vanguard and told them to remove the excess from my Roth IRA and transfer the funds to my Roth Traditional account (which I opened just now). I think this was called re-characterization. They moved the extra funds from my Roth IRA to my Roth Traditional account. Because this year was red, and I was in loss, they moved around $5,300 to Roth Traditional. This action has generated a form that I will present to my accountant when doing the taxes. 
4) Once the funds were settled in Roth Traditional acc, I asked Vanguard to do a conversion and transfer them to Roth IRA. They did and they told me that I must fill form 8606.

My questions:
1) When I fill this form, should I declare just $5,300?
2) Where am I submitting this form? (to the IRS website?!)
3) What should I bring to my accountant when doing the taxes?

Since then because of various factors...including unexpected expenses we thought could wait (something in the house which wasn't an issue when inspected but then became an issue that needed dealt with after a bad storm), no matter how we budget, scrimp and save. Things keep coming up which cause us to resort to living paycheck to paycheck and accumulating debt.

1562,1,"Hi, I hope I’m in the right place. I’m looking for advice/opinions on my current financial situation and curious if buying/building a home is the right decision for me given the current market. 

Context: 

I’m a 26 year old single adult in South-Midwest USA. I currently have the privilege to live in my parents house due to both personal and financial reasons. Since I don’t pay actual rent I have been able to save up a few thousand dollars and I’ve even dabbled a bit with investing the last year (nothing crazy, just some mutual funds and a 401k with my work). I have no immediate plans to move out nor are my parents planning to kick me out,  but obviously I don’t want to live with my parents forever. 


I have recently been offered the opportunity to buy some land off another relative for an extremely discounted price. (They’re asking $500 cash for 3 acres of land, kind of a steal)
Having my own property already would (presumably) make building a small home a more realistic option for me since I could use the land as collateral. I’m just not sure if this is a wise decision financially? 

I’ve been looking around for months on rent/mortgage prices in my area and I’ve been comparing them to the average cost of building a small home/building/trailer.  I’ve found that the price is basically the same either way, and that doesn’t even include the price of land. So I’m thinking if I’m paying the same amount either way + basically getting free land I’m kind of stupid not to take this opportunity, right?

I just worry I’m being too naive and not considering this from all possible angles. One of my biggest regrets in life was listening to all of the adults in my life telling me to go to college despite the huge financial consequences. I don’t want to make this decision as carelessly. I have never owned land or a home, my only experience is renting a few different apartments during my college years. Furthermore I haven’t borrowed this much money before. There are a lot of “what ifs” and I’m not sure if it’s wise to make a commitment like this. 

More context: 

- I’m very in debt. I owe about $80k in student debt. I haven’t started paying my federal loans back yet due to deferment but I have been making pretty aggressive monthly payments for the private loan I borrowed. I anticipate to have the private loan paid off by the end of this year. I also still owe on my car and will for another few years. These things alone I feel like are flat no-no’s to a lender, my debt to income ratio is kinda screwed right now. Even if I can secure a loan, I feel it will be absurdly high interest/monthly payment. 

- The land in question is very close to a popular liquor distillery that gets a lot of tourism. I don’t think I’d have much trouble selling the land/home later down the road should I decide to move, 
but that is a “what-if” that worries me a little. There’s no telling the future. 

I think that about covers it. If anyone has any input or advice it would greatly appreciated! Thanks",Is Buying a Home a good decision for me?

I noticed my initial shares had just been partially vested to me last week, but also noticed they were not adjusted to account for the stock split. When I messaged my CEO he said that weren't going to be split, and that the reason we got extra shares was so that our overall equity wasn't diluted.

I heard on other Reddit posts that some people are using VUSXX and other Treasury Money Market Funds as a replacement to a high-yield savings account and they say it is very liquid. But I noticed that the short-term government bonds the fund buys have an average maturity date of 28 days. So what happens if a lot of people want to take their money out? Would the fund then have to sell the bonds before maturity? If they do, wouldn't the fund lose money and that would mean VUSXX isn't as safe as a high-yield savings account? 

Also does VUSXX or a high-yield savings account like Ally bank pay higher yields in general? Because I noticed in 2021 and 2010-2015 the yield on VUSXX turned 0.",How Does VUSXX (Treasury Money Market Fund) Work?

I'm debating on what payment option to take for a coding BootCamp. They offer three options:

1. A 6-month program paid upfront at $20,000
2. A 6-month Program is deferred at no interest for $31,000, paid by 15% of your monthly salary once you do get a job.
3. A 12-month part-time program deferred at no interest for $33,000, paid by 15% of your monthly salary once you get a job

For all of them, you are given 12 months to find a job after you finish the program, but I'm assuming it will take me six months to land a job after each program.

I do not expect to stay at this job for another 2 years for a slew of reasons. In fact, I had just gotten through a tough interview process before getting told ""we want to hire you but they just froze hiring"". They said they'll reach out to me mid-year when they expect the freeze to be over. Even if they don't call me back, I plan on leaving in the next year.

Up until now, I've been contributing 6% to fully leverage their match. Obviously, my own pre-tax contributions to the 401k are nice. The funds are OK and I ultimately will probably just roll over into my IRA that I manage.

Is it in my best interest to just continue contributing the full 6% or should I just take my full paycheck and contribute it to my IRA?

1615,1,"Hi All - I have two fairly specific, related collections questions I'd be grateful for some guidance on. The TL;DR is I got calls from collections agencies about two different bills, one which I never received the original of, and the second which I tried to pay but never received an answer from the company on how to access their system to make a payment. Trying to figure out how to resolve these without tanking my credit report, which I've tried very hard to keep pristine :)

I got a call from a collections agency saying a FedEx invoice I owed was in collections (value of $51.50). I was pretty surprised because I never received snail mail or email information about this bill/invoice; the first I heard of it was when collections called me. That being said, I made two big moves recently (one domestic within the US, and one international, I'm now based in the Middle East), so there's a chance it was never forwarded (I did set up mail forwarding to be safe). Now, this is a $50 bill, I just want to pay the damn thing. But I'm concerned about this showing up on my credit report. It's not currently on my report, but my understanding is if I pay the bill, it may still show up on later; at that point, do I have any recourse? Would showing them proof that I paid the bill be sufficient to get it removed from my report? Is it worth contacting the collections agency and asking for confirmation that this won't get reported before I pay? I've never dealt with collections, so not sure what a reasonable ask is here.

The second issue is with ConEd, the NYC electric company. I closed my account with them when I left NYC last summer and transferred everything to the new tenant. A few months later I got an email truing up the amount I owed after a meter reading (about $300), which I was ready to pay. Problem was their website wouldn't let me log on to the system to pay b/c my account was closed, so I emailed support asking for guidance on how to pay, but never heard back. I called them, they told me to email support.....So a few weeks ago I get a call from collections about the bill, which on a personal level I find frustrating given that ConEd sent me a bill with no way to pay it, but that is neither here nor there. I asked them to email me the invoice with payment instructions, but haven't heard from them. They even took down my email address, so not sure what the deal is. This one is also not on my credit report, but I'm not quite sure what to do. I stupidly didn't write down the name of the collections agency so don't know how to follow up. I *do* have a copy of my email to ConEd requesting guidance on making the payment, but as of now, that's the only proof I had that I tried to fix this debacle. Any ideas on what a reasonable next step should be? Am I just a sitting duck until they either contact me again, or this shows up on my credit report?

I've never had anything sent to collections before, and I'm not trying to shirk my financial responsibilities here, but I also know that navigating collections agency can be tricky and I just want to do the right thing while protecting myself/my credit history.

1618,1,"My wife and I have solid incomes, have saved a lot (across multiple investment vehicles), have an emergency fund, two real estate properties and our debt is low. We have three kids and 529s that are in good shape.

We are both in our late 40s and hope to retire in our late 50s. By that age our last child will be in college.

We have had a brokerage account with Morgan Stanley for over 15 years. I also keep a rolled over IRA with them. The performance of the investment hasn’t outpaced non fee based investments but I’ve stuck with them because they assist with financial planning and review our entire portfolio. They have also assisted with questions about real estate planning (purchased a second home for my mother to live in). However, the support has dropped in recent years to levels that make me want to try something different.

Most of our investments are with Fidelity now (401ks, early career Roths). I also just move our emergency fund to Fidelity because I can draw better interest rates than B of A these days (although I’m still trying to identify the best fund). I‘m planning to do in kind transfer to Fidelity from my investments at Morgan Stanley. I met with someone at Fidelity to discuss the process and to be quite honest, I wasn’t overly impressed with the guy. Consolidating all of our accounts at Fidelity, we are in the ballpark of 2m so I was disappointed in the first interaction. I’m also not impressed with some of the tools available on the Fidelity website. I recall tools in the past that helped with balancing your portfolio based on your risk profile. I can’t seem to track them down now.

My goal is to have all accounts at Fidelity and to have someone review my plan on occasion and make recommendations on investments. Perhaps a quarterly check in. I’m done with active management by a broker. I just want the review and guidance. Occasionally I may also need tax guidance.

[M26, NYC] I’ve had a Chase debit/savings account for a long time, opened when I was back in high school.  For two years, I’ve had a Chase credit card.  I pay off 90% of my card every statement.

But I’m below water in terms of living expenses.  I have stuff in a Roth IRA and a Brokerage Account elsewhere, but I am not touching that except to add to it.

My Chase savings account has $15k, and while I am optimistic about a raise in the near future (and very likely a change in employment too), my current income does not support my basic living arrangements.

I need to basically liquidate my savings, put $5k-$7.5k into a checking account, and put the remaining half into the mentioned brokerage account.  My hope is that the $5k-7.5k can supplement me until the raise/transfer of job.

But Chase seems to mandate that I need to have a savings account in order to have the checking/credit accounts, and my cursory knowledge of modern banking practices leaves me thinking that I don’t need to keep my money there with them, doing nothing for me.

1664,1,"Sorry everyone, if this is the wrong place. Please point me to the correct sub if it is. I'm in California.

February last year, my dad had a medical emergency. Sadly, he didn't make it. His hospital bills were extensive, but my parents were very low income and he was on Medicaid.

His bill came in May and insurance paid most of it and the hospital forgave the rest. The amount due was $600, which I paid for my mom. The bill was printed in May and the due date was in June 2022.

Last month (December) my mom got another bill for $3964. It shows the same account number and name for my dad, but has a completely different Bill ID and the total billed is higher by the same amount. It also shows the $600 that we already paid. This bill was printed in December but has the exact same June 2022 due date.

Is this... Legal on the hospital's part? We haven't had any correspondence with them since I paid the first bill. I was hoping this fit under the No Surprises Act, but that seems to be more for ambulances. And can we get in trouble for the past due balance, when they never even contacted us about it?

I plan on calling later today when the hospital's billing department opens, but I'm wondering if there's anything else I can bring up?",Unexpected second medical bill

1703,1,"Hi team, seeking some forecasting strategies or advice for a year full of varying expenses MoM and past expenses that don't seem necessarily indicative of future spending habits. 

**Life situation:** 

* Been living with my fiance at her moms (rent free) for the past 6 months 
* Getting married end of March and will be spending about $25k on our wedding over the next 3 months
* Both with predictable salaries and get paid twice a month
* Would like to move into our own apartment soon (ideally before our wedding - budget permitting)
* Started tracking expenses in Mint since October, however, it has been hard to trust using those expense categories in a forecast for 2023 because we've been traveling / eating out more, spending much less on groceries and haven't been paying rent
* We have travel aspirations this year (Honeymoon &amp; plenty of weddings) that we want to budget well for to help us decide if we need to make some sacrifices this year, and or to help alleviate my financial stress
* I will also add that last year was a bit of a tough year for me where my salary was below my cost of living (Damn you Bay Area...) and I only recently was able to crawl back from CC debt thanks to the living situation with the future mother-in-law &lt;3

All this to say, I have been somewhat paralyzed trying to put together a 2023 plan for ourselves. My current thought process is: 

1. **Nail down a reliable estimate per general category / month** (Groceries/dining, Bills, Car, shopping, Health care, personal) - really difficult to nail down when I don't feel I can really trust the last 3 months of Mint charges (very high travel expenses, for example)  - *any advice on how to do this effectively?* 
2. **Adjust those expenses by month** (increase rent, grocery, utility costs when we plan to move out)
3. **Add in large ad hoc planned expenses** throughout the year to account for our potential plans (Honeymoon flight purchase in Feb, Paying wedding photographer in march, etc.)
4. **Nail down savings** \- Understand which months can we actually expect some savings. Unfortunately, given all of the increased expenses with wedding &amp; moving out it feels like we'll have to deprioritize monthly savings in the short term to be able to fund some of these big purchases (I'd like to not do this obviously, as we'd love to start saving up to buy a house)

So I'm seeing if anyone has any forecasting strategies or advice they might be able to help me out with to nail down our financial plans for this year full of expense changes. 

**Ultimately my goal is to understand:** can we afford ALL of those weddings we got invited to? Can we  afford a 2 bedroom Apartment in LA? Is it feasible for us to get a dog? And to generally get control, understand, ownership of our financial situation, to stop stressing about money and big purchase decisions. 

FYI I am trialing out YNAB, but realize that the tool is less for forecasting and more for getting some ownership over our finances (especially since we'll be combining most of our finances)

I’m looking for some advice on how my partner and I can be more efficient with our finances. I like to think we’re good with our finances but I will always seek out more advice from smarter folks.

I’m a 24 year old accounting analyst at an employee owned engineering firm and I earn about ~ $61K annually. My partner is a 23 year old special education first grade/kindergarten teacher who earns ~ $44K.

I keep a monthly tracker in excel for our finances, but we don’t necessarily budget (which is something I would like to explore). We typically average a net income of anywhere between $1.2K - $1.6K a month. Unfortunately most of that profit sits in either of our checking or savings accounts. I do own some ~$500 in stocks in multiple companies but I’m not well-versed in stocks in general.

My company offers a 3.25% match on 401K and I currently contribute 10%. Is there more I could be doing to maximize this?

**to note. I know of the avalanche/snowball method of dealing with debt etc, but I am concerned she doesn't make enough money to make any progress in paying any of these cards off**

Originally she was $9,000 in debt. So we devised a plan and started paying it off monthly and it would have been done by this month. When I asked her the progress she withdrew and showed me the truth.

The debt was not $9,000, but actually grew to $14,000 and was spread to over 6 credit cards. And he credit score was 550 according to equifax. **in short she didn't tell me the truth**

She can easily pay off 2-3 of the cards as they are only $300 each. But the last 3 start at $1,000 and go upwards from there.

To add to this she has very little income. I'm talking 800-1000 a month. And that's if I pay for all her living stuff so her whole check goes straight towards her debt. 

The problem being of course I have no idea if she is making so little that she is basically throwing her money in a bottomless pit and she's going to keep owing more and more?

So any advice will help. Does she pursue bankruptcy? She is 30. I just dont see how she can get out of this if she doesnt make enough money unless someone gave her the money which her parents nor i am willing to do. And letting this go for this long not doing anything about it.

I don't have a ton in savings, though, outside of my 401k for retirement, because I paid off a lot of medical debt over the past 3 yrs, so as much as I'd like to help her avoid the loan, I can't just gift/lend her a large lump sum of money, because that would wipe out the remainder of my savings.

I currently have $123,000 in my OPERS account that can be refunded. I’m also going back to the federal government where I’ll receive a pension (currently have 4 ½ years and plan on staying indefinitely.)

I currently have:

$25,000 in TSP
$13,000 in Deferred Comp
$6,300 in IRA
$11,000 in HSA

$12,000 – Car loan – 3.74%
$27,000 – Car loan – 2.5%
Cash/Emergency Fund - $15,000

If I rolled the entire amount over to an IRA, at 65 with a 7% annual ROI, it looks like it would be around $817,000. If my math is correct, I’d have to live 40 years after retirement to receive that much via my pension.

Two questions:

Should I leave my pension with OPERS or roll it over to an IRA? Although I’m generally an optimist, I don’t trust OPERS to remain solvent long-term, nor do I trust our fat cats in Columbus to keep their hands out of the cookie jar forever. I’d also like to roll it over while the market is down. 

Should I cash out enough to pay off the $34,000 personal loan since the interest rate is high? I believe, in additional to the taxes, there’s a 10% penalty for cashing out any of my pension early. I’m hesitant to do this, but the thought is appealing.

If you're interested in the intersection of philosophy and personal finance, I highly recommend giving this video a watch. It's worth the time investment, in my opinion.

1769,1,"Hey all, sorry for the stupid question. Basically, I've used TurboTax almost every year with the exception of last year, because I believe last year they charged a fee for their service, when every prior year it was free (for the basic edition). I think I remember reading about some criticism for charging customers for this for the first time. Last year, I used FreeTaxUSA instead (which I think I still had to pay a nominal fee, like $10-20).

Anyway, I was just perusing TurboTax's website and noted that they do have the free edition for this upcoming tax season.

Did they bring this back or did they indeed still offer this last year? I'm just wondering if I should use TurboTax again or stick with FreeTaxUSA.

* We save about $4k/month, primarily because we live in an utterly trash apartment.    
* Jointly, we have ~$200k saved for a house downpayment. We live in a HCOL area. This money is sitting in some mix of I bonds, short-term treasuries (4-5%), and HYSAs.

* She has about 20k in student loans.   


Here's where things get complicated. 

* We had planned to get a house during the coming year, but we don't really like the city we live in and want to move back home  -- across the country.

1799,1,"My partner and I have racked up a large amount of debt on a credit card with a staggeringly high APR. I'm an authorized user on this card and I hadn't realized that the rate was so high until last month when I wanted to know for sure because we felt like we were getting nowhere with the payments.

Debt is ~9k and the interest rate is ~28%

Knowing that, I wanted to try and get our balance transferred to another card with a low rate (or none for a starting period) so we could have some room to breathe. To this end, we signed up for the Citi Simplicity card hoping it could help us. Got the card, limit is $2000, and we've called support to get it raised and were declined due to the newness of the account. We're not even going to touch this one if we can't use it the way we planned to.

The original card is paused and we haven't spent with it in months now. I've committed to paying it down $500 a month. Partner has agreed to that as well, but they can be inconsistent because of the nature of their job. So I see two timelines, one where we pay $1000/mo and one where we pay $500/mo.

With $1000/mo, if my numbers are correct, we'll have this thing paid off in about 10 months and incur ~$1000 in fees. If we trend closer to $500 each month, we'll pay it off in 2 years and incur ~$2300 in fees.

With our new card, the balance transfer method only seems to work if we can get a credit limit that can cover the bulk of the debt. Doing it $2000 at a time will incur 5% transfer fees, and the original debt is still accruing interest while we pay the other card off.

So now I'm not sure what to do...

2) I could be wrong...but due to inflation the longer that I have this loan the worse it is for the bank holding the auto loan. I am actually doing them a favor paying this off fast.

I ordered a jacket about 5-6 months ago from an online site that didn’t arrive as expected. I contacted the company and they told me that I could return the package in its condition, however because they’re located in China, I’d have to pay the shipping fee, which I did. They told me that once they received the package, they’d give me the refund. It’s been about 5 months since I shipped the package and they still haven’t received it. The tracking number I received showed that the package is somewhere in China. For some context, I live in the United States.

At first, I was able to make the claim and the bank gave me temporary credit, however just today, I received a mailing letter telling me that Bank of America concluded they couldn’t approve of it. Now, the money has been removed from my account and the claim is shown as closed. The only papers they provided in the mailing letter they sent me included the emails I sent to the company and pictures of what the jacket looks like and that the transaction went through, but as I mentioned, I did everything the company said to do (paid the shipping fee, sent it via USPS, and used the correct address that they gave me). I tried calling the bank to explain the situation, but it tells me the bank is closed and it hangs up on me.

My adult cousins and I were gifted some working farmland in a midwestern US state (in which none of us live, although we all live in the US) by our grandmother before she passed. It's not a lot, but it brings in a total of ~$25k in rent before taxes annually split between the six of us. It's farmed for commodity crops by our aunt &amp; uncle, with whom we have a lease. We have had it for about ten years and are now considering selling it. It's supposedly valued by the assessor at about $550k, and we're thinking we would do better to sell and take the windfall than to just continue receiving the rent payments. All my cousins are pretty interested in moving forward w this but we're still trying to figure out what to do. We'd probably get it appraised and then give our aunt &amp; uncle right of first refusal to buy the property, which we think they would. It would feel good to keep it in the family and we wouldn't have to pay an agricultural realtor.

1821,1,"Hi all,

I am a newer ""higher income"" earner and have always historically invested in both a traditional IRA and Roth IRA.  I was contributing to my Roth IRA for 2022 until August when I realized I was over the allowed AGI to contribute to a Roth.  

I had a pre-existing Traditional IRA (from a previous employer 401k rollvover) and contributed to it instead of the Roth IRA thinking it was a smart idea since my 401k was maxed and it was an option for additional investments as of August until current.  This was before I knew about backdoor Roths. 

So, for 2023, I'd like to do a backdoor Roth.  The issue is that I have this pre-existing Traditional IRA that has quite a bit of money in it.  My thought was to do a reverse rollover into my current employer 401k, but I made the mistake of contributing money into it that are no longer pre-tax as of August of this year (see above).

  
My questions are:

* Can I just withdraw the Roth IRA contributions as cash without penalty since I shouldn't have made them?
* Can I still do the reverse rollover from the traditional IRA to my employer 401k even though there are 4 months worth of contributions that are not 'pre-tax' so that I can begin doing clean backdoor roths as of 2023?  If I can't do the reverse rollover due to the post-tax IRA contributions that I've made in 2022, what are my options?

Hope this makes sense.  Thank you in advance.

I am 25 y/o and looking to solidify my retirement plan. A little over 3 years ago I started contributing just enough to my 401(k) to take advantage of the full employer match (post-tax). As of 1/1/23 my employer started offering Roth 401(k) contributions.

The only thing I am skeptical about with the Roth IRA is that I read the income threshold to contribute is around $150k, and I anticipate I will surpass that sometime within the next 5 years.

I can currently sell it for \~$8k above what I paid for it. However, the bank I have the loan through will not issue the title to a new buyer.

$30k in eTrade brokerage (stocks that were gifted to me from my grandmother over a decade ago, XOM and Msft, I would prefer not to touch these for sentimental reasons and the fact the market is so down... This might be stupid rationale and I will politely accept a roast)

- 23 yo, with a gross annual income of 62k/year. It’s my first job out of college. I started 6 months ago, but I plan to leave after 16-20 months for another job depending on the economy.
- Take-home pay per month: $4k
- Total expenses per month (includes $200 allowance for fun money): $2k
- Emergency fund: $9,300 in a HYSA as of December 2022
- Federal student loans: $14,500 (2-4% APR, but no interest has accrued)
- Private student loans: $10,470 (5.79% fixed APR on a 5-year payment plan, where I have been paying $202.05/month since September 2022)
- No CC debt

I’m not worried (yet) about my federal student loans, but I am wondering if I should continue investing in this bear market or pay off my private student loans in full. Over 5 years, it will accumulate ~$1,650 in interest—$330/year. 

I started investing in late-November 2022. I have $3,000 (principal) so far in a taxable brokerage account—60% VT, 10% each of SCHD, SCHG, AVUV, and individual stocks. 

However, I will begin funding a Roth IRA this month that I will max out before funding my taxable account. My job doesn’t start matching a 403b until I have put in one year of service in July 2023, at which point they will match my 5% with 8% on their end (13% total). My take-home pay should roughly be the same after 5% pre-tax starts getting taken out on account that my taxes get lower as well. 

I plan to retire early at 45 yo in my native country (Philippines), where the cost of living is much lower; and so I don’t ever plan on maxing out my 403b—or 401k if and when I do switch to a private sector. I haven’t crunched the numbers, but I feel that maxing out my Roth IRA every year going forward is more than enough to cover my expenses from 60 yo onwards.

Given that I have finished building my emergency fund, 
- **should I invest the $2k that I have left-over per month after my expenses;**
- **pay off my private student loans in full this month with my emergency fund and start my emergency fund all over again;**

Now the question I have been pondering is the following:

1. Go all in into an SP500 fund through Charles Schwabb and continue investing my monthly savings and hope for the long term gains.
2. Buy a rental property (probably an apartment downtown in the capital), paying no less than 50% of the asking price and financing 50% or less. Pay the loan + all extra savings into the principal to try and pay off the property. The idea being into creating a cashflow stream in the medium term. Probably once I have 3-4 apartments start diversifying my savings into SP500+rental.

All help is appreciated as I am a bit lost on what to start focusing at this stage.

In my thinking, I cannot have the 401k pull on there as it would be past the max allowed for the 2022 year (which is when this pay period is from) and I shouldn't need to contribute additional SocSec taxes as for 2022 they were already completed and my last few stubs has a $0 value for those.

I am a project manager for an engineering company. I have had my position for around 5 years.
I do good work, consistently get good reviews and have normally received decent yearly raises.  

This past year was tough. Some things happened early this year with the company owner who had a lot to do with the day to day inner workings of the business, and he had to take a huge step back. This was followed almost immediately with the other project manager quitting.  I was handed about 50% of the workload, (on top of my usual work) but somehow managed to make it through. It was a hard year. My boss did give me a small bonus (first bonus ever, despite bonus/profit sharing being a talking point and dangling carrot for years! We never thought they would actually follow thru on it)
I honestly just felt like it was the least they could do considering how much more work and stress I was absorbing with the internal company changes. 

All in all, it wasn't a great year. Things still are not back to normal, and it seems the expectation moving forward is that my work load will not go back to how it was in 2021/early 22. 

I was curious what contract would look like this year.  I received it this week, and was disappointed to see that I was receiving a 2% raise. By far the lowest I've ever received.  My review was great, they were happy with me and my work. 
Considering cost of living has increased in my area by 7.5 %, and I know the company has priced new work accordingly, I wasn't thrilled and spoke to my manager, who said that they've decided to start doing a yearly bonus at the end of the year, (up to 8% of my current wage) if certain profit margins are met. So basically, I AM receiving a raise according to them, it's just in the form of a bonus. 


I really don't know how to feel. To me, a bonus is meant to be a bonus, and considering how long they've been talking about it and dangling the carrot, it feels a bit sneaky to finally initiate the bonus, but do it in lieu of a raise.

I'm asking, assuming that I am going to help with 50% of the costs, should I put in one year's tuition and expenses per kid and hope it doubles in 8ish years? Maybe 1.5x in the case of the oldest one? Or should I be thinking in terms of a percentage of my own savings when finding my maximum prudent contribution?

1854,1,"Hi all,
I understand property taxes increase every year and I expect it, I was just a bit surprised this year and have some questions. 

My husband and I bought a house in Massachusetts in June of 2021. The estimated taxes were 3,306.

In January of 2022 we saw our taxes were increased to 3,532. That was about a 220 dollar increase. We knew it would increase because it was the first year after buying a house. All is good and fine. It ended up being a 30 dollar increase per month with insurance also increasing. Not the end of the world 

This year though, we just received our taxes and they will be 4,004. That's an increase of about 470 dollars, which is about a 13% increase. I'm looking at a 70-100 increase in my monthly payment if my insurance increases the same way. 

Is this normal? Allowed? Do I expect it to continue every year because I don't know if I can continue to afford the monthly pay increase of $100. I thought the cap increase in mass was 2.5%",Property taxes continue to increase exponentially?

1856,1,"With the new year here and being able to contribute to my wife and I IRAs for the year 2023, I realize that we might actually be over the contribution limits for 2022 and 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in March/April 2022, my wife and I opened IRAs on Vanguard and deposited $12,000 in each, $6,000 for 2021 and $6,000 for 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

For the year 2021, our AGI was \~$132k, and both my wife and I earned over $6k that year. All good.

For the year 2022 however, I believe our AGI will be \~$210k, so pretty close to the contribution limit for 2022 ($204k - $214k). I am not sure how to confirm that AGI before filing for 2022.

For the year 2023, I would expect our AGI to be \~$220k, once again very close to the contribution limit for 2023 ($218k - $228k). So at this point I believe we won't contribute to our Roth IRAs for 2023 and open traditional IRAs instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this situation I have a couple of questions:

 \- I'm still not sure how to calculate MAGI from AGI. Our tax situation is pretty simple (filing jointly, no mortgage, no student loan, standard W2 employment for both), so can I assume that AGI = MAGI?

 \- Should we deduct the amount of IRA contributions from AGI (so $12k for 2022 for example)? I see you can also deduct tuition and fees, what does that cover? Childcare expenses?

 \- If we contributed more than we should have for 2022, how do I correct our contribution? Should I just reach out to Vanguard directly?

 \- What would the penalty be? 6% of the over-contributed amount per year? So if we contributed $1000 over the limit and I do the correction before March/April 2023, I can expect a $60 penalty?

I moved back to CO on a huge whim and it actually turned out about as well as it could have. I am now making 76k with a raise to 78k this spring working a union job in Pueblo CO.

Houses are expensive here but it seems like after 2023 things may get more reasonable (330k for a new house for example). Company is about as good as you can get in my field, there's 1 other place 1-1.5 hours away where I could make a few dollars more but realistically this is it. I'm not sure I can fathom working this job for 30-40 more years but it is very cushy and legitimately may be the best job in the whole industry with everything accounted for, or at least among the top ones. I could make more but it'd be doing 3rd shift in a more expensive area which I have no desire to do.

We have some downtime at work so I started programming again and finished a big side project. Prior to that I did an internship at the end of my 2nd year in CS as a software engineer intern. It got me thinking about finishing my degree. Long story short the local and online options just don't seem good to me. So it seems like if I want to finish the degree I'd need to go back to SC for 2 years, which the university has approved with in-state residency as a readmit.

1908,1,"Bank rhymes with 'Villainy"". Fitting, LOL, since they're focused on high-interest lending.

TL;DR: Can I call Villainy Bank, ask them to reinstate the accounts and continue making payments? Is that a thing? 

Or do I just settle for 25-50% of the balances due, and accept I'm not doing business with VB for 7 years, if ever again? Will my credit report show that I settled, and for what percentage?


Trying to make long story short, life has sucked and I basically stopped paying bills for 6+ months. I moved, Villainy Bank's letters returned as undeliverable and I guess they assumed I flaked on them. One regular credit card ~$4K line and one ""promotional financing"" ~$1K line auto repair card. Both, of course, maxed out.

If Villainy Bank had said ""pay up by x date or it's going to collections"", I would've done it. They called about a billion times but never laid out a timeline by which account would be charged off. My other credit lines did, and those I paid up.  

The good news: the VB credit card never showed up on my report, for some reason. The auto repair card did, but neither are showing up now. 

I'm not some lowlife deadbeat. I spent the money, and I then spent more money instead of paying back the money I spent. So I want to pay back the bank if I can. But if I can't, they abandoned me by charging off my account, so screw them &amp; I'll settle it with the agency. 


I would estimate I paid back between 40-75% of the total spent on the accounts before they were charged off, excluding fees and crap. My credit is hovering around 550 and I'm not planning to buy a car or house in next 10 years at least.","Bank sent 2 CC accts to collections. Am I screwed, and if so, how badly?"

Fast forward to today, and I get a million credit alerts at once, all telling me that my old account is with a new collections company. I am just now finding out that no matter the start date of the original debt, if it gets sent to a new company, the age essentially resets.

Shame on me for not knowing that, but I'm trying to do what I can to fix this ASAP, since my score plummeted overnight. Obviously, if a debt could in theory float around from company to company, and just keep resetting forever, my best option is to just pay it off, right? I could theoretically pay it all right now, but it would almost wipe my E-fund out (I guess that's what it's there for, right?) 

I also know companies are often open to some kind reduced settlement negotiation...is there some kind of guide on how to make that work? I've heard horror stories from people dealing with collection firms, so I want to keep my interaction with them to a minimum.

We both work full time for the same employer, in non-patient care Healthcare field and have WFM flexibility. My wife has always seen working as a means to an end but is terrified of financial instability, due to circumstances growing up. However, with the cost of daycare we are looking at ways of making a transition for her to SAHM. She would prefer to raise them over working a less fulfilling job, if possible for the next 4-5 years. Daycare costs would go from 7k to 20k if we chose that route (would have to move daycares and go from part time to full time for first child).

Current combined income is $101k ($52k &amp; $48k) before taxes, and it is likely I will receive a promotion in the department in the next year as everyone in our department has received this promotion after reaching my experience level ($52k to $67k). If not, there is a competing employer hiring for my exact position that this is their salary floor. I plan on applying regardless but prefer to continue where I am.

Additionally, my BIL and his wife are expecting in April and have expressed interest in paying my wife to watch our niece. My wife would love to do this as well, charging a “fair” rate (slightly under market value, around $8-9k), but we also want to consider tax implications of this for them and us (report income vs. cash, deductions,  etc). They make about the same as we currently do. We are close and on very good terms but also want to consider contract/liability issues as I am sure that 99% of problems could easily be worked out but would want to be protected.

Wife also considering selling crafts on the side (Etsy, locally, etc.) as she enjoys doing it but we don’t want to rely on this income.

My situation is fairly straight forward but I've been getting conflicting advice on how to budget. 

I'll be making $80,000 pre tax, more with bonus but I don't want to count on that at all. It should be taxed at 22%, plus social security and stuff will bring it to about 30%? 

So, I'm left with about 55k give or take, or $4600/mo. From here, how do I break this down? I have no car payments or anything like that, my only overhead should be rent and food and gas.

I was looking at 50-30-20 but a guy in my office told me I need to be spending way less than 50% on rent and food and saving way more than 20%. He said I should be spending no more than 20% on rent and 5-10% on food. 

I don't think this is awful advice, but I'm having a hard time finding an adequate apartment in my city for under like 1700. The other thing to consider is if I'm closer to work and paying slightly more, I can walk and save on gas costs.

I have $8,800 in an Emergency fund and continuing to save $200/mo. 

I spend about $1000/mo on my car. $200/mo for insurance which I could drop down to about $175/mo. And I have a ~$46,500, 65 month loan at 1.24% leaving me a monthly payment of $845. I also have $8,750 saved for car expenses, mostly tires &amp; registration (very expensive in my state) but could cover any other emergency repairs, I’m not currently adding any additional money to this savings.

I also save ~$400/mo for “fun” stuff, money to spend on concerts/travel/fun experiences etc. Currently this account has $5,600 in it.

Currently I live at my parents home and pay $0 for rent &amp; expenses. I am hoping to move out to an apartment sometime early 2023, I have $5,500 saved up for furniture, and all the one time costs at the start of the lease. I live in a HCOL area so a 1 bedroom will be ~$2,000 - $3,000 a month before utilities. I would prefer a 1br over a studio because I work from home full time and would like the extra space.

I also plan to spend around $225/week on groceries, household supplies and generic spending money once I move out.

I have 3 credit cards, one through my main credit union, one department store card (they were a previous employer and employee discount was easier with the CC), and an Amex gold. I do ~98% of my purchases on one of these 3 cards to get the points/perks and fully pay them off each month.

I have a few main questions and am looking for general advice on things I can do to improve my financial decisions.- Am I saving enough for retirement by just making out my 401K? What other options do I have as I believe my higher income would make me ineligible for some accounts?
- Regarding the $8,750 I have saved for my car, would it be better to keep this saved for car expenses/registration? Or should I put it towards the car loan or allocate that somewhere else?
- Will 30K be enough for a down payment on a home as a first time home buyer? I know this will depend heavily on the market/area but I’m not sure if 30K is reasonable in general or if I should target more.
- Realistically how much can/should I afford for an apartment when I move out? Is 2-3K a month feasible? I for sure want to stay below $3,000/mo for rent &amp; utilities as I know I could better spend that money earning equity, but is that even a realistic target for my income/expense level?
- Any other advice or ideas on things I should be doing differently to better prepare myself for my future?","27 and unsure if I am making the right financial decisions and budgeting correctly, looking for some help!"

1963,1,"TL;DR: Looking to buy a home in the Denver area and hopefully take advantage of the housing crash people are predicting this year. My primary objective is to build equity.

My finances are as follows: I'm 27M and work as a software developer making $86k annually. Monthly I take home $4600, of which $1200 goes to rent. After factoring in necessary expenditures (gas, groceries) but before impulse spending, I have $2300 per month (probably spending less than $300/mo recklessly so by a conservative estimate I'm still $2k in the green.) I have $57,000 in liquid assets. My credit score is 760. I have no outstanding loans or debts.

My lease is up in April, but I'm aware that 3-4 months is not enough time to find a house. Ideally I would renew for \~6 months and have something lined up by the time that expires late into the year.

As of right now, Zillow is showing very few listings below $400,000, and the Buy or Rent calculator says that at $400k, I would have to stay there for at least 8 years to break even.

My first question... Is this objective is realistic and worthwhile at this point in time? I figure this crash will be the cheapest property is going to be (especially in Denver) for a pretty long time, which is why I feel pressured to act soon. On the other hand, if I were career-focused enough, I'm sure I could get my career path to outpace inflation.

Some other general questions:

* I'm aware that market fluctuation is unpredictable, but it seems people are still able to make educated guesses about it. Is there a rough estimate on what would be an ideal time to buy?
* Aside from HOA fees, what other considerations are there regarding a condominium?
* Aside from hiring a home inspector, what should I be paying attention to when assessing the quality of a home? I'm capable of using my own eyes and ears, but tips on where to look would be helpful.
* I have no experience negotiating with a bank over things like interest rates. What should I keep an eye out for? If I get a lousy rate can I just walk away and ask a different bank? If I don't have a house lined up, can I just walk in and ask for an estimate for what kind of interest rates I would qualify for based on my income and credit?
* I plan on keeping a decent amount of money in my bank account even after my down payment, as I intend to be prepared for maintenance-related incidents that require immediate attention.

Now, I work part-time starbucks while full time back at school, and doordash as additional income. I've always had a buttload of debt, which is no different now, however now that my income has been cut short, I will no longer be making sufficient money to cover all my debts. For minimum monthly payments for car, rent, and loan/credit cards (so, this does not include the cost of food, gas, phone, etc) then I pay $2,800 each month. That means for work at my average pay 15/hour, I'll have to work around 200 hours each month to meet bills, and that's on top of school. Considering I'll likely only get 80-100 at sbux, that means I'll have to do 100 hours of doordash each month. That's my current outlook, and it's really grim. 

I have had little help from people in my life in decades past (I'm 34 now), and due to medical issues and other life circumstances it's been incredibly difficult to get on top of finances. I paid off almost all of my student loans previously, but have been paycheck to paycheck for a while. 

in credit cards/loans, i have about 63k in debt.  i also got a new car (my first one ever!) and i owe 36.6 total still, only had it for a year. Rent is maybe the only thing that might be flexible, although i have already worked out a deal with my gf for somewhat lower rates so that's not really an area i can do much more saving. 

for expenses, I've pretty much limited all expenditures. even for food, I take as much of the expiring food from work as they will let me, to keep costs down. I'm really at a loss. I may have tax return money, and I may have student loan money coming back to me for next semester's classes, but at best these can maybe push me out a month or two. I'm already spent through any of my savings, and right now I'm about in tears every night because I feel so utterly hopeless with my situation.

I know nothing about bankruptcy or anything like that, I'm scared they'd take my car as it's the only asset I have, and I love it, and it's quite reliable. I'd still need a vehicle to get to/from work and school, and not having a car would put a serious dent in my ability to make income to pay debt. I'm working on re-doing my budget, AGAIN, but it just seems there's no amount of hard work and bootstraps that can get me out of this mess. 50 hours a week on top of class seems like so much, and that's provided I get scheduled at sbux and there's doordash availability. 

What should I do? Should I look into bankruptcy options? If i do that, what is the liklihood they'll let me keep the car I have, or will they repossess it? that's my biggest concern. Should I j ust do what i can to work as many hours as i can and prolong all of this? I'll ask my parents for cash, but I expect them to say no / have no funds available.

1988,1,"So I have a question and I will admit it is a fortunate position to be in. And I tend to think I am splitting hairs here. But is maxing out a 401k/thrift always a good idea?

Here is my situation: Hubs and I are the same age (late 30s) and make decent money, although we are in a high COL city so we aren’t wealthy but we are well off. We both max out our retirement and have been since we started our careers around 27 (school before). Because of our higher salaries and with match, we have each been putting 17% away in tax deferred retirement accounts. We own a home and our mortgage is 2.85% so it is cheaper than rent in our city. Have about $15k in stocks, $20k cash, and $20k ibonds that mature this year. So while our retirement is rather healthy (even with the downturn and starting in our late 20s) I would like to have more accessible funds. 

One of the reasons we didn’t save more outside of retirement is because we both had hefty student loans (mine paid off last year hubs done in 18 months). 

The question is this: should I cap our retirement savings at 15% so I can invest/save more in non-retirement accounts? Or should I just keep matching because at this point I’m just splitting hairs and that extra 2% will mean so much more when I retire in 25 years? Like increasing from the $20,500 to $22,500 for 2023 is going to cost less than $100 from my paycheck which I probably won’t notice with my COLA adjustment kicking in.

I am 24 years old and am not very fluent when it comes to retirement savings or investing and would like to try to maximize my retirement/savings yield. Below is my current situation:  


* 24 years old, making $75,000 in US
* Live in a city, but don't plan to live here for more than a few years, so I don't think buying a house makes sense at the moment, but I would like to own property sometime sooner than later
* No car, only expenses are rent, groceries, and other basic day-to-day things
* Each month I put away around $1000-$1500 into my high yield savings account which is currently at 3.3% APY
* I currently have around $75,000 in my savings account which netted me almost $200 in interest last month
* I have a little under $30,000 in gov student loans, no interest has accrued and the payments are frozen, and I am waiting to pay this until we find out whether the $10,000 relief comes through/when the payments unfreeze
* I switched to a new job last month, so I have two Fidelity 401k pretax accounts
   * The one from my old job has about $20,000 in it (similar salary to the new job, and this was after 2 years)  and is no longer getting any money put into it
   * The new account is set to 8% contribution with a max of $2,000 match from my employer
* My takehome pay is about $2,000 semi-monthly (from around $3,000 gross after taxes, insurance, 401k, etc.)
* My rent is only $800 as a friend bought a house and split the mortgage between himself, me, and our other friend/roommate. However, my rent will probably go up to around $1000-$1300 next year if I move in with my girlfriend as I may be doing

My main concerns are, should I be putting the liquid cash I put in my savings account into some other form of investment like a Vanguard account or something similar? If so, what is the best way to maximize the free money? Should I be putting more into my 401k? 

In general, what are the best ways to invest/plan with my money?

Also, when it comes time to pay the student loans, does it make sense to pay it in full, as I did the math and the current interest rate nets me more in my savings than the interest I accrue on the loans.

2005,1,"I am hoping to get some good advice and not sure things could get any worse than they are already. I’ll try to be concise while also adding pertinent detail. 

A couple of years ago I (stupidly) co-signed for an apartment for my brother and then a couple of months ago I got notified that I got a negative mark on my credit report. It turned out to be for the apartment for a little over $10K. 

I had started receiving harassing calls from a collection agency a couple of months prior to the negative mark but I never answered. They rarely left voicemails and when they did, they were looking for my brother specifically. I didn’t really piece it together that it was for that apartment. Eventually I blocked the number. A couple of weeks after, I received calls from a different number and they left a voicemail and this was the first time my name was being mentioned.

I ended up answering and they explained what the debt was for. Up to this point, I was under the impression that I was relieved from any co-signing responsibilities. This was due to the fact that I had spoken to the apartment manager 2 months prior to the end of the original 15 month lease contract to ensure that once the contract ended, I did not approve or consent to any extensions or renewals. I was told that my brother had already submitted the notice to move out by the end of that contract.

Fast forward to the day after I received the derogatory mark notification, which is when I left work early to speak to the apartment manager. Of course, the apartment was under new management so this wasn’t the lady I had spoken on the phone to the prior year. Thankfully she was really nice and tried to help me understand as much as possible. She told me that my brothers contract “rolled over” into a month to month plan which meant that I was still responsible as a co-signer. On top of that, she could not provide me a copy of the lease contract for some reason but she had it pulled up on her computer and showed it to me. She pointed out that my name nor signature/initials were nowhere to be found on the contract. 

By this point, I go home to review all my documentation. I found a pre-leasing agreement that I filled out and signed but the form specifically says that it’s not a guarantor binding document and was strictly to see if I qualify for co-signing plus it showed it was for unit X but the actual lease agreement I was shown was for unit Y.

I’ve sent a cease and desist letter to the collection agency along with a copy of the lease agreement and pre-leasing form claiming that this was under dispute. So far the only “proof” they have provided is a copy of that pre-lease form as well as an itemized statement from the apartment (which does not show my name on). I’ve also filed a dispute with Experian which was finalized just this past Friday and the results show “verified and updated”.

So I just now got off the phone with Experian and they claim that they have confirmed that I am responsible but that they cannot provide me with the proof directly. They direct me back to the collection agency for that but as I mentioned their “proof” does not seem valid.

It's a new year and over the break I have been thinking of business ideas or other avenues to earn extra cash. In the past year I have been ubering in my free time to pay the minimums since Sept. Today, I am left with $11,589.92.

My school loans only cover my living expenses and I have used some of my allocated grocery budget to meet the credit minimums. I have a credit score of 576 now (the beginning of the year I was at 730). I read on here that I could apply to balance transfer cards with 0% interest and I got rejected to two credit line so far.

 I know if I saved 200$/week this year I could pay it all down but in my budget spreadsheet, the minimum monthly payments is 437$. I don't see how I could do both. Everytime I have contributed more to the minimum I still am charged with the interest on the CC that takes nearly half of the minimum payment.

I'm happy enough with my investments as they are, but I've been doing a bit of forward looking planning in terms of how I could access this money eventually. It seems like the restrictions on the 401k are limiting, and perhaps the best path would be roll it over to a Roth IRA so I could access at least my contributions early. However, I believe there is a 5 year wait before it's possible to access any funds in an IRA. With all this in mind, my questions are:  


1. Is the above generally correct?
2. Under what conditions should/shouldn't I consider starting to roll over my Roth 401k to a Roth IRA now in order to start the timer?
3. Does the 5 year rule apply to the funds in the account or the account itself? Ie. If I rollover some today, wait 5 years and then rollover some more, do I have access to all of it or only the funds from today?

So basically, for New Year’s Eve my friends and I got a hotel room. Everything was cool and fun. I put the room on my card because it was my idea. After I checked out I got emailed a bill for 169 dollars. That’s fine that’s the price I was told when I booked. Then when I check my account at home it says my card has a pending charge for 190 dollars.

I called up there to see if there was some explanation for the extra money, and the worker seemed confused and was looking at my reservation from over 6 months ago for prom, where I got snacks and stuff from the lounge and charged the room, however, when I got the bill when I checked out, they never charged me for the snacks. Then he realized his mistake and went to the correct reservation from the night before and said that 169 dollars was the correct price and that it was “probably” just an incidental fee that will go away

So it’s either an incidental fee or they might be trying to charge me for the snacks from 6 months ago I’m not sure since the worker seemed unsure too.

Basically my question is can they charge me for the snacks from last time? If they didn’t put it on the bill last time, and I didn’t get any snacks this time therefore it wasn’t on this bill either, can they charge me for them since it’s not technically on any bill?

Right now the charge is pending, but in the case it doesn’t change to 169 dollars am I allowed to dispute the charge? Or would that be wrong?

I’m not necessarily worried about the 20 dollars, it’s just more of the principle of being overcharged with no clear reason why.","I think I was overcharged, is it okay for me to dispute the charge?"

Hello, this my first time in this community post and I am sort of in a pickle. To start off, my mom wants to use my credit score to purchase a property in NJ to rent out to people as an investment property. However, I refused because I am saving up for a home for myself down the road.

My mom is remarried and my stepdad does not have credit because he does not have papers. They were talking about purchasing a home among themselves to rent out to others, and my mom asked me to co sign with her for the home. I refused because I want to use my credit down the road to get a loan for myself. Afterwards, my mom got upset with me and said ""I don't help her with anything"". I was confused because whenever she needed something I was always there and I never ask her for anything. Then I asked her ""you had 10 years to figure out your credit so why are you trying to hurt mines""?

Today, they both tried to convince me but I still refused. They said that once my stepdad got his papers he would use both my mom and his credit score to refinance the house under both of there names, and I would lose nothing. TBH, that sounded to good to be true and that made me even more skeptical of there plan. They also stated that I would get something out of it but this seems like something that we will fight over and I am not interested in investing in property right now.

If you're wondering, my mom's credit scores isn't that great. The other day she went to a mortgage broker and asked about financing a home under her name. The broker said that she will get refused because her income isn't high enough.

My concern is the number I put into 4c is several hundred dollars, which seems high. Is the W4 assuming I’m the sole income earner for us and adding the amount in 4c to adjust for the fact that my wife does work, or will the amount in 4c be added to what is already being withheld in taxes from my pay stubs with my Single filing status?

I'd later distribute what I have in SPAXX between my three normal funds when the stock market shows signs of recovery. I understand that by doing that, I could miss a day of awesome market growth and that's a deterrent for me.

2078,1,"Hello,

I'm being made redundant (being laid off) from my job. This will happen on Monday of next week. I have significant share options vested with the company. It looks like it's going to cost me around $45k to exercise these options and then I will get hit with an income tax bill for the value of those shares minus the exercise price. I expect the income tax bill to be around 175k (I'm in Ireland and I believe its a 52% tax hit total).

This means I will end up paying a little over 200k total after the income tax hits. I don't have anywhere near that money, but if I don't exercise my options then I will lose them in 12 months.

I have no idea what to do. I don't want to lose this potential value that I have worked incredibly hard for over the past 38 months, but I also don't want to pay that massive tax bill when the shares are not liquid (Private company that hasn't done a buy back since 2021).

I live in WA - no state income tax.

The most recent 4-week treasury is earning 3.83%, and right now the ladder is averaging 3.72%. But then I look over at my Vanguard settlement fund - VMFXX - which has a 7 day yield of 4.21%, 4.10% net after the expense ratio. VMFXX seems to good to be true.

1 - It's paying a higher interest rate than short term treasuries

2 - It's less work - instead of managing a ladder all I have to do is drop my emergency fund into my Vanguard settlement account and let it sit

3 - It's practically as safe as treasuries since it's very unlikely to drop below $1.

4 - It's more liquid - I could withdraw all of the money today if I needed to instead of getting some back each week.

2085,1,"Hey guys,

Like many of you probably experienced over the last year or so, my 401k, which is managed through a third party investor, is currently losing money and both of my funds are down about 18.3% on the year. Luckily I don't have too much invested just yet, but considering the only reason my balances were increasing was due to contributions, it's incredibly disheartening. 

Background on the funds, I worked for two companies that provided matching programs and I contributed as much as I could afford at the time to the 401k for that employer. When I left my first job for the second, I opened a new 401k but kept the old one to continue growing, but now I'm at a job that offers a pension so I've neglected to contribute to either of my two old plans. I set both of the risk profiles to relatively high, with the understanding that I'm young and I have plenty of time to build my retirement nest egg, and that any potential growth would outweigh short term losses, however with the market as it is right now I'm starting to rethink this strategy. Should I adjust my risk profile to a more conservative investing profile while the market is still so volatile, or should I just ride out the high risk profile until the market starts to rise again?

Also, before anyone mentions it I do intend on a) combining my two former 401ks into an IRA with this provider, and b) I do plan on continuing contributions despite my current company offering a pension, it's just been a busy couple of months since I started my new job!

2126,1,"Hello PersonalFinance users! 

I'm trying to get more on top of my financials this year and had a question about credit card balances. I get paid the day after my statement is due up on the 27th (about $700 if that matters), but I get paid on the 13th as well. I have auto-pay on my credit card that will pay the statement the day before on the 26th. I'd much rather pay it all off on the 13th and not have to worry about stretching the 13th's paycheck to make sure I can cover it.

My question is - if I pay off that balance well before the due date, can safely turn off auto-pay since my balance will be at $0 for that cycle? Credit card debit is scary as hell, and I just want to be extra cautious that I'm not planning on making a stupid move.

2134,1,"My girlfriend recently received a notice from the IRS (CP2000) indicating that she owes more money on her 2020 tax return ($6,000 tax, $1,000 penalty for significant under-reporting, and $500 interest). Thankfully, this high figure is based on wrong assumptions^(1), and I re-did her taxes properly and it's down to $2,800 and $200 interest.

The instructions on the notice said if we agree, to send a check. If we disagree, to respond in writing. I have the response, along with all new forms and schedules.  

My question is -- now that the [interest is 7%](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/interest-rates-increase-for-the-first-quarter-of-2023) (4% Federal Short Term + 3% fixed), is it wise to send a check for what we believe to be the correct amount + interest? The idea is to stop the interest from accruing even if the IRS wants to counter with other corrections (if any). Or do we just sit and wait... under my assumption interest keeps accruing.

For context, I'm familiar with taxes (IRS VITA volunteer) and am reasonably confident in my new figures for her return. If there is any disagreement with the IRS, it would be small, or they might ask for proof. But it took them 1½ years to send out this notice, I don't want interest on $2,800 (the amount really owed) to be running for another year and a half!

And backup question: should I submit proof, like her 1099-B showing the basis figures? And her medical expenses showing HSA distributions were qualified? I know this isn't an audit, but it shouldn't hurt right?

A small home rental in my darling downtown has become available next month. Rentals are hard to come by in my area so it immediately peaked my interest, as it’s exactly what I’m looking for. It would be used as a Waldorf inspired preschool. The reason why I consider this “risky” is because my daycare license is still pending so it could be a few to several months before I’m up and running.

2139,1,"Quick background:  I'm getting married this year.  My income is above the Roth IRA limit, so I have been making backdoor contributions for years. I have no money in a traditional IRA.  

My fiancee's income is below the Roth limit, so she has been making direct Roth contributions for years.  But where we differ is that she also has money in a traditional IRA.  When we get married, our combined income will be above the Roth limit if we file jointly.  

Questions:

1) Can I still make backdoor contributions and avoid her traditional IRA triggering the pro-rata rule for me/us?  From some quick googling it looks like I can, but I would really like to see the IRS guidance or some kind of proof that I will be safe doing this, if anyone can provide it. I have never filed jointly before and really don't want to trigger any kind of penalty.

2) Because our joint income will be above the threshold, my understanding is that she will not be able to make direct Roth contributions anymore if we file jointly. My instinct is that if her traditional IRA amount is relatively small (like a few thousand), it probably makes sense to roll it over and pay the taxes considering the years of backdoor contributions that might be ahead.  Is there anything else I need to think about here? What other factors are there that I should be aware of?  Does the timing of when we roll it over matter?

2B)  Are there any quick guides to help decide if it makes sense for us to file jointly or independently? I realize for most people jointly is better, but not for everyone, and I just want to find a quick way to figure out where we fall.",Backdoor Roth for me if spouse has traditional IRA?

I'm based in the USA and here's the situation:

My Wife has an HSA from her previous employer in 2021 that we would like to move to a brokerage HSA that's not yet open (Vanguard/Fidelity/etc). Across 2022 she was enrolled in a HDHP plan with HSA at her current employer. However we elected to switch to PPO plan for 2023 for her, and her coverage started Jan 1 (2 days ago). We do not want to roll the 2021 HSA into her 2022 HSA, and instead transfer it to a brokerage HSA (consider it a central HSA for all future job changes versus rolling into new job's HSA). I don't expect her HSA eligibility to come back around until 2024 or 2025 as we need the best HC coverage until then.

Questions:

Can we even open the brokerage HSA now, on Jan 3rd 2023, based on the fact that she is no longer under HDHP plan that ended on 12/31/22 and now under PPO plan? 

What about the fact that it's to be opened to TRANSFER an OLD HSA and not to ""contribute""? 

Was our only option to open the brokerage HSA in 2022 while she was still covered under HDHP?

I requested to change to my married, legal last name on my Capital One accounts (1 checking, 2 savings, and 1 platinum credit card) without much issue except for my Capital One platinum card account: it’s the only account with correspondence still addressed to my maiden name and I’ve been calling their customer service line every couple of months for the past 7 years to try to get it corrected. I know it’s just a name, but I took my spouse’s last name mostly because I went no-contact with my abusive father many years ago and wan no association with him. Seeing my abuser’s surname tacked onto my first name is triggering, and I become really emotional about it.

I had to have the platinum card reissued multiple times before they finally sent me one with my correct legal name on it. I finally got the card with my correct legal name just last week, but every email and piece of mail I’ve gotten since then regarding that card is still addressed to my maiden name, including the paper letter the card was attached to as well as the email correspondence about my card statements

I’ve lost countless hours being transferred around and explaining this issue over and over within departments at Capital One over the years, and every single one of the people I’ve spoken to keeps saying that everything on their end says my last name is updated. I’m not proud to say that on my most recent 1.5 hour call to get it fixed, I completely lost it on a couple of poor customer care associates, yelling about how I can’t be the only f***ing customer with a name chang and how I feel disrespected and angry that they don’t have the decency to do a deep dive into whatever CRM they use to fix whatever data fields they pull from for mail and email correspondence.

&amp;#x200B;

But, after a couple of months of freelancing, I made more money than at that stupid job I had before. I was so into my job and was inspired to create something new that I completely forgot about filing taxes (in a couple of months).

I faced this pay stub issue when I began looking for a new place to rent. I wanted to live by myself for a while since I needed a peaceful and quiet environment to work in. At my current place, it’s almost impossible. When I started looking for properties, landlords kept asking me to provide a pay stub. Then, I realized that the only good thing about having a job is receiving all the papers required from your employer.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I think I know how I can fix this problem. But I’m not sure if it’s gonna work for me. I found an online paystub tool creator. There you fill in all the required info and get a ready-made paystub. You get everything except for a signature from your boss. So, should I sign everything myself if I’m my own boss? Is it going to be a legitimate pay stub? What about taxes, then? What should I do?

2167,1,"Hello everyone,
I sold my first house back in September of 2021 and was able to reap 3x profits without paying any taxes on capital gains. This has raised my liquid asset close to $500K. 
I've been living in Europe close to 10 years and took interest in purchasing a property from a dear friend in Germany. Proactively, I converted $200k into euros when the dollar and euro where 1:1. Unfortunately, things didn't work out as plan and I will no longer be purchasing any property in Europe.
Wanting to put the rest of my money to work, I created my first investment porfolio with $170K. I intend to hold it for the long run to profit from its dividends payouts.
Lastly, I dumped $30K on 'I Bonds' (three family members, $10K each account) when the government was offering 9.62% for six months. I plan to hold these for a maximum of five years.
The remaining balance (Approx. $80K) is sitting in my savings account.

Here's my plan for your evaluation:
The €200K I have will be re-converted to dollars upon my return to the States. That could be as early as this year or in the next six years. As the euro slowly recuperates, this will generate a good return. Of course uncle Sam will want his share. My plan is to transfer the principal amount  I converted and the remaining balance, transfer it in increments under $10k to avoid triggering the IRS.

The investment account was created based on performing dividend aristocrat and king stocks. Is this a good option to produce passive income?

How effectively am I managing my money? Is there a better way to produce better results?
My goal is to build a wealth of $1M dollars within the next 10 years.

Thank you for your time.",I sold my first house. Now what?

2170,1,"First I want to acknowledge this is very much a first-world problem but I’m so lost and made this burner to ask for advice.

I am still in college, my parents are going through a very messy divorce and they have multiple properties (mortgages on some) as well as some liquid capital and some other investments (but primarily the properties). Because they could not reach a reasonable settlement, and neither want the other to have it, they want to give anything with joint ownership over to me.

Now I don’t want to take their money, they’re clearly both very unhappy and I want to do the best for them, and make sure they both have a comfortable lifestyle in retirement. Preserving what they have built and not losing too much to this hyperinflation is my goal. I am still a student, and after looking up some basics, it seems like I would have to pretty much immediately liquidate the properties just to pay the taxes, I don’t want to do that. Is there a way to avoid this? My best hope is for some kind of passive income stream. I don’t want to sell them either because it seems like the rent is paying for the mortgage and then some.

I’m really lost as to what to do, I’d like to think I’m good with money but this is a sum of capital entirely out of my pay grade and I'm kinda fried in the brain, both with this news and the divorce. I also want to make sure they both have comfortable living situations and are able to keep relying on this sum without me having to be the arbiter of who gets what, just looking for some advice.

gig work. I used to have a credit score of 760 and with a certain credit card limit of 9k. I have always been pretty good at keeping my usage low and making my payments. However I lost my job and
had to put a bit more on my credit. It ended up having a balance of $4800 out of 9k. Wich was bad I know and I was going to make a decent payment
on it. However I just saw that my credit card provider lowered my credit limit, to 5k... and I have a balance of $4800. So now when it gets reported
next, it is going to really screw my credit since it looks like almost 100% usage. I still have a credit score of 740 and always make my payments on the
credit card, never miss it and I use the card pretty frequently. Not sure why they did this to me. I am wondering if it is smarter to take out a personal loan that credit karma keeps offering
me. Or if I should open another credit card to get the balance back to where it was? I obviously wish Icould just pay off the whole balance now but I cant.

Background: I'm a student officer for a personal finance club at university, and we're trying to do more speaker events for our members. Someone suggested that we invite a personal finance influencer to come speak. Some suggestions include Graham Stephan, Erika Kullbergh, and Vivian your rich BFF.

I'm somewhat conflicted here. On one hand, I know getting someone who's tiktok famous or YouTube famous to come speak to us will definitely spark and attract interest. On the other hand, I'm skeptical about influencers, especially finance ones, as a whole because of issues surrounding transparency, conflict of interest, and diffusion of responsibility in giving out broad and general financial advice to people who might not fully understand the asterisks before implementing it. I also know Graham Stephan got in hot water for supporting FTX before it blew up on him.

2200,1,"My company recently started offering the option to contribute to after-tax non-Roth as well as in-plan Roth 401k rollovers aka Mega-Backdoor. Super happy about this but also realizing I don't have a way to properly calculate how much to contribute. Here's why:

- 2023 Standard employee 401k contribution limit - $22,500
- 2023 Total 401k contribution limit - $66,000
- Employer matches 4% of Total Compensation
- Total Compensation consists of Base+Bonus pay
- Total compensation is unknown until Jan of following year
- Employer match is paid in Jan of following year

Since I don't know what my total compensation will be in 2023 I don't believe I can calculate how much I can contribute exactly. I run the risk of either under or over contributing.

As an example consider:
Base Pay: $100,000
Bonus Pay: $0 - $100,000
Total Compensation: $100,000 - $200,000
Company Match: $4,000 - $8,000

How much should I contribute in 2023? 
66,000 - 22,500 - x = y
x = employer match (unknown in 2023)
y = my after-tax contribution

If I contribute too much, my employer will not be legally allowed to contribute the full match amount and I lose out on money, right? 

PS. My employer has until March 2024 to submit their employer match for taxes occuring in 2023. Since they are paying out the 2023 contribution in 2024 does that technically mean that specific match will count towards the max limit in 2024 instead of 2023? If so, that solves the equation, but since they're submitting it for tax year 2023, it makes me think this is not the case.

2203,1,"So my SO brought up the idea of moving into a better apartment even though we want to eventually buy a house in the future. his argument is that he wants to live somewhere comfortable, with your own assigned parking, bigger place, better environment and possibly one with a pool/gym.

I don't agree because right now we have the cheapest rent in the city, our rent is $1k with one bedroom and you don't find rents that cheap in the city unless you move to the country side but the country side is about 1-2hrs away from our jobs. you can find rents slightly cheaper but it is always a studio or just one with no parking. We live in New England so having parking is essential! especially during the winter months.

I told him that i much rather stay here until we have enough money for a house. We don't have too complaints where we live except that living in the city has been eating up our cars because of how bad the roads are, is a smaller place, we managed to get an extra parking spot only because our neighbor only has one car but if he were to get a second car then there's a chance we might have to give up one of our spots.

His argument about saving for a house is that because of how expensive houses are here, it would take us years before we are able to have enough for a house. so he figures why not spend that money at a better apartment.

2206,1,"Early in 2022, my wife asked for a deferral that would give her the max $20,500 contribution to her 401k. This was working fine initially but we unfortunately just noticed that in July they stopped making the deferral. (Our mistake for noticing so late…). Apparently their payroll system incorrectly flagged that she had reached the maximum after $10,260. They’ve admitted to the mistake and say it’ll be fixed going forward but that doesn’t make us whole for their mistake.

The missed deferral brings our MAGI up to where we have to reduce our Roth IRA contributions, so this has implications beyond just the missed pre tax contributions this year.

I’m not very happy to accept “oops our bad but nothing to do.” But I’m unclear what we can ask for them to do. Can they make corrections on the last few paychecks with near 100% deferral (and we send them the money)? It seems like if they can’t fix it they might owe us QNEC money but I’m not clear on that and honestly I’d rather a fixed deduction due to the tax implications. We’ve made it difficult on ourselves given we didn’t discover until the end of the year and so no more 2022 paychecks to fix it with.

The stocks I have in my Robinhood are VTI, SPY (1 share each), AAPL, MSFT (2 shares), ETSY, TSM, ABNB,

I am looking into these 3 funds for my three fund portfolio:

* FZROX (70%)
* FZILX (20%)
* FXNAX (10%)

Does this seem reasonable? I've seen people recommend FXAIX...should I go with that?

2227,1,"TL;DR: Parents are paying $700+/month for car insurance, thanks to two brand new drivers and a recent accident. Is this the rate we should expect?

I'm a 21-year-old driver living with my parents (late 40s) and my brother (18). My parents own a 2020 Expedition, 2014 Edge, 2006 F-150 (paid off), and a 2001 Ranger (paid off). My parents currently pay over $700 a month for car insurance through USAA. I believe it's the full amount of coverage offered. My brother and I only became licensed three months ago, and two months ago I totaled a previous car we had in a collision that was my fault.

Obviously, all of this would naturally add up to a pretty high rate. It's a lot of vehicles, with two brand new drivers and a recent collision on record. With that in mind, is $700+ a ""reasonable"" monthly premium, or is it still absurdly high given the circumstances? I want to suggest to my parents that they at least get a smaller level of coverage, but the full coverage really saved our asses in replacing the car I crashed. Supposedly my mother has shopped around a bit and was not able to get any lower quotes, but I don't know how in-depth her search was. She says she can't find better rates, and doesn't think anyone would be willing to insure us anyway so soon after an accident.

The situation worries me a lot. With the insurance and two car loans combined, our cars are eating so much of my parents' income that I'm afraid it might be untenable. What can we do to mitigate the costs? Do we need to shop around more, reduce our coverage, or just ride it out until my brother and I have longer driving records and/or move out of the house?

Side note: Personally, I think the biggest culprit is probably the 2020 Expedition, but it's been an extremely hard sell getting my parents to consider swapping it for a cheaper car.

* $100k emergency fund in HYSA (probably too much, would like to move to stocks but valuations scare me a little bit)
* $100k in taxable investments (all equities)
* $50k in crypto (it used to be more...)

* $200k annual gross base salary with 15% bonus that I've hit for two years
* $5.6k monthly expenses excl. rent (based on all my credit card activity)
* $4k monthly rent for 1bd apt

2239,1,"I am a tradesman in my early 20s looking for the right budget app. I mention I am a tradesman because my hours can be inconsistent, especially in the winter. The app that would best suit me deals in percentages. Here is what I am thinking...

I want to set spending allowance based on percentage of hours I input. For example, lets say I add up all my necessities (rent, bills, loan payment, ect.) and it is $1000 (For easy math). Based on my average spending of less specific expenditures like groceries, water, electric, ect. that most likely can't be determined to the exact dollar amount I can create an ""allowance"" for everything else besides those necessities. Then I want 10% to go to savings, 15% into retirement, 10% in to investments ... ect. So if I work 8 hours a day, when I log those hours I want the money to be dispersed by the amount of time I have to be able to afford that expense. So if I buy groceries once a week (I get paid weekly) then immediately, my grocery allowance will be ""filled"" based on my average spending to eat for the next week.Things like rent, that are monthly, can then be split between, lets call it 4 weeks of pay, equally after my immediate things are paid for.

The math would look like this... 

8 hours of work a day - insurance and taxes = Income

Income - ($1000 / 4) = Share given to necessities divided by time

Income x .10 = Share to savings

Income x .15 = Share to investments

Income x .20 = Share to intangibles

(This is just an example so i don't care to allocate the full 100% after necessities)

Now the main goal i want out of this is to divide up the part of each share NOT USED. If I work more than normal, lets say 50 hours, so I have excess then, because I am using percentages, I will have more than I need or want to spend in any given category which I can then move elsewhere or put into savings.

Vice Versa I want to know on weeks I work less than 40 hours how much I have to pull out of reserve or aware from investments ect. It would be better even if the app intentionally drew out of investments to fulfill necessities when necessary. 

It would be great if I can link my accounts as well.

As you can see, I am spending more than I am bringing in. Most months I am able to put money away or chip off more than 50 on the credit card. But due to a super cold week in december as well as needing new boots for work, I was not able to break even.

The credit card debt is from needing truck repairs, snow plow kit for said truck and 2nd job, as well as month to month backup spending (such as boots this month). The loans are through my bank so I dont think I can ignore them like the federal loan pause.

2262,1,"I signed up for legal aid benefit via my company and I want to prepare a will this year. I have no children/spouse. When I die, I want some of my money to go to my brother. The catch is he is SH** with money. if he inherits a lump sum, he will spend it all within the year and be homeless afterwards.

I guess an annuity is the simple way to describe what i want to give him. i want him to get money monthly for the rest of his life, inflation adjusted (or whatever is closest to this as possible). but i want to make sure he can NOT cash it out for a lump sum. i know the idea of what i want, but i don't know how to implement this.

1) is annuity the right option? if so, is there a way to prevent cashing it out?

2) how do i set this up? would the legal aid who help me write a will be the right person to talk to? or do i talk to insurance companies? do i just need something in writing, or do i have to actually set up something while i'm alive?",Planning an annuity for heirs? (US)

So I make 68k per year and out of impulse I bought a $18,988 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SE truck 2020. Low mileage when I bought it 12,241 miles! Now it’s 13,124 miles. Pretty great on gas mileage I do have to say because of the automatic eco mode. 

Anyways with taxes and dealership throwing gps/theft premium total is $20,588 I could’ve got something else but it had everything I wanted. I’ve been driving it for almost a month now. I checked kbb and my car is worth 17k. Each month my car is depreciating and I wanna sell it after it pay it off … 

Jan 10 will make a month and I’m already tired of the car. My first car payment is due Jan 21. I only have 16k in the bank, $3000 in my savings account and $1,000 in my 401k. 

I don’t like monthly car payments so my plan is to pay 3,000 each month until I get rid of this car loan. That’s 7 monthly payments. In July I will be done with my car payments.

You guys pointed out my rent was too high. You were right. The more I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I got paying 45% of my take-home for rent. I also forgot about social security and medicare being taken out of my gross pay, reducing my take-home.

Simultaneously, I had an out - my landlord had not signed the lease (there were some other issues, not the point), so I got out and started looking for cheaper places. I found one for $500/mo cheaper. 

But I forfeited my $1000 security deposit. It's in the contract that if you apply for a lease but don't end up signing, they keep the deposit. Moving was already so expensive for me. That's 3% of my current income, vanished into thin air.

2282,1,"Hello,

I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering in 21' and actually ended up taking a gap year to travel the world a bit and see the family with some money saved up during COVID. Now, with my first degree-related job out of school I am making $70,000 a year with 3-15% (8-11% on average) profit-sharing contributions starting **FY24**. I also received an $8,000 signing bonus which is waiting to be used to eliminate a loan. I'll get into my debts and monthly expenses later, but as for retirement options, I will be putting the Roth IRA and maxed-out contributions on the back burner until my high-interest loans disappear. 

My question is, coming from a family that I wouldn't call financially literate, how can I best approach my current student loan situation:

* **Private** \- $5,700 - 11.24% \[$140/mo\]
* **Private** \- $10,500 - 10.63% \[$280/mo\]
* Federal - $4,500 - 5.05% 
* Federal - $2,100 - 5.05%
* Federal - $500 - 5% \[$60/mo\]
* Federal - $5,500 - 4.53%
* Federal - $2,000 - 4.53%
* Federal - $4,400 - 4.45%
* Federal - $2,200 - 4.45%
* Federal - $3,500 - 4.45%
* Federal - $5,500 - 2.75%
* Federal - $2,000 - 2.75%

**Total: \~ $48k**

**Monthly (Net): $4150 - $420 - $60 - ($120 + $120 + $150) = $3,280 -&gt; $3,250**

I give a rough breakdown above, but the only monthly expenses include the gym, gas, and food which sit under $400 total each month. The only major purchases I've made since getting this new job have totaled $2,000 for a new set of tires and some much-needed preventative/maintenance work on the vehicle.

My plan is to pay off the highest interest-rate loan ($5,700 @ 11.24) and one of my federal ($500 @ 5) in the coming week, setting me back $6,200. It would open up $200 from minimum payments which could be stacked elsewhere, along with these bulk payments I've been planning. Is this a fair method or am I looking at this wrong? Is there a certain interest rate (say 5+ percent) that screams pay it off now outside of my two private loans? I've done plenty of research on snowball v. avalanche but I feel like I'd rather have a mix between the two once I move from my private to federal loans in roughly five to six months. The varying values of principle across 2.75-4.53% are my main question mark because I am aware that at a certain point you'd rather save/invest alongside the market rather than aggressively pay off lower-interest loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Little backstory, I finished grad school about 6 months ago and moved to another place where I took a job in my medical field. This job pays me very well and is honestly the first job in my life that I ever made good money. I'm 41 years old, single, have a mountain of student loan debt and have a bit of car loan debt...I currently make about 160k per year with my job as my starting salary.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought the car I have a payment on right after graduating. When I moved here to Portland OR, my car was stolen the first night I was here, and I honestly needed some transportation living in a new city, and found what I thought to be a good deal on a car. I didn't' have a bunch of cash on hand since I had just graduated, so I put down 5k on a 25k used car, and my payments are now $462/mo as I also bought a warranty which I normally would not have done. My interest rate is 7 or 7.9%, I can't remember which, main reason it's high is because the car I bought is a 2011 model year and banks don't like to give good rates for older cars I guess...

&amp;#x200B;

I have no life which is good for me financially, but of course terrible for my mental health. I rent an apartment for about $1700/mo, my power bill is about $30-$70/mo, internet is $80/mo, and I spend about $1700/mo or so on food, fuel, car insurance, and other incidentals of living.

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to save a decent chunk of money after my insurance claim paid me out for my stolen car, plus just banking my pay that I don't spend to live each month. I currently have about 38k in my checking account, and about 2.5k in my savings account. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would have even more, but I've been spending a TON of money on my mother who had a bad stroke at the end of September. Spent some money to fly out and see her when it happened, and then I've spent even more money to take care of her and take care of things for her since she makes very little money from disability retirement as well as death benefit annuity. I'd say I've spent about 5k on her in the past three months, and 4k of that was just in December because I need to now pay for her long term care since she still can't be alone and take care of herself...I will continue to pay at least 3k/mo for her assisted living facility.

&amp;#x200B;

First question, should I pay off my car with the money I have sitting? I've been apprehensive given my new financial situation with my mom, plus I know it's good to have money on hand for an emergency fund etc. If I did pay off my car in one lump sum, I would most likely sell it once I get the title just to be rid of that debt. It has kind of become clear to me that perhaps I don't deserve any nice or fun things right now, and I drove back to Portland after seeing my mom with my free and clear car that I had gifted her after I graduated because I wanted her to have a nicer car because I love my mom of course.

&amp;#x200B;

Second question, if I don't pay off the car right now, what should I do with my money?

&amp;#x200B;

Third question, which is more detailed than the last, should I consult with a financial planner or an accountant to go over my situation and get advice on how to invest to make my money grow for later in life, especially given my late start to the game?

&amp;#x200B;

Further backstory, before I decided to go to school, I worked in law enforcement for six years for the state of AZ and have all my contributions along with the state's contributions to my pension, still with the state of AZ. I decided to leave those funds alone after I left in 2012 because there is still a good death benefit for my mom if something happens to me, the money still makes some interest (although I don't know how much), and when I reach retirement age, it will still pay me several hundred dollars per month if I leave it alone...

I have no preexisting medical conditions and I'm in decent physical health. These insurances being offered are through Unum.

&amp;#x200B;

Voluntary Coverage I can choose:

Hospital Indemnity Insurance - $13.91 per paycheck. Provides $2,000 per covered hospital admission once per year. Provides $100 per day of a covered hospital stay, up to 60 days once per year. Provides $200 per day in intensive care, up to 15 days once per year.

Accident Insurance - $7.19 per paycheck. Covers costs associated with accidental injuries.

Critical Illness Insurance - $4.67 per paycheck for $30,000 of coverage. Covers costs associated with critical illnesses. Can be used every 180 days for recurring conditions, or immediately again for an unrelated second illness.

&amp;#x200B;

The total for all three insurances comes out to $25.77 per paycheck. In theory, these insurances sound like a good idea but I am concerned it may just be a waste of $51 per month and none of the information in my packet lays out which conditions/injuries are covered and which conditions/injuries aren't covered.

I am single, 28yo, living in Washington state (no income tax), and make 70k/year. My partner and I will likely marry in the next 2 years and she makes ~100k. In addition, my work just started offering a 401k that I'm contributing 5% to (they match 50% of first 5%), I have a 10k brokerage account, and have roughly 5k misc investments (crypto, stocks, etc.). 

The next steps I've been thinking about are:

1) Open a HYSA that my partner and I can start using to save for bigger purchases (home, car, etc) and that I can also use as a personal emergency fund. (Ally lets you have ""buckets"" so I think keeping things separate will be easy)

2) Open a Roth or Traditional IRA, but definitely more confused when it comes to this. I really don't know what my future income will look like, but it is likely this year that I break past the 73k limit for Traditional IRA deductions.

My boyfriend of 3 years recently purchased a house, originally thinking he  would rent it out but has realized he needs to live in it for at least 1 year for it to be considered his primary residence. He’s moving there in March, and has asked me if I would like to live with him.

If I said yes, we would live there for at least 1 year while I save up money to buy my own house. Then, once I bought my own house we would repeat the same setup and live in mine for at least a year. That way we would each have an asset in our own names before eventually getting married and buying a home together. 

We have talked before about moving in together later this year, so this is an earlier timeline than expected. We are also both very young, 23 and 22. We’re quite serious and marriage has been discussed, but we want to wait until we’re at least 25. 

My main hesitation is that the $1500/mo rent he is requesting is more than I wanted to spend on housing.

$410k salary

No non-mortgage debts

$40k-$50k/yr expenses

Long term goal for now is to be able to retire early by my late 30s/early 40s with about $3M-$5M in investments. 

—————-

I live in HCOL area and I currently live in a condo worth about $400k ($75k equity, $325k mortgage @ 3.5% interest). This condo is only about 500 sq ft and I bought it a few years ago. At that time, 500 sq ft was plenty of space but a lot of has changed since then and I feel like I have outgrown the space. For example, I have since gotten a dog and had to build a home office in my bedroom after my work transitioned to WFH (something that I had not anticipated when buying pre-covid)

In order to move up in house, something in the neighborhood of $800k-$1.25M would fit my needs well without having to move excessively far out of the city. Anything cheaper than $800k just isn’t feasible in my area. Problems with under $800k would be things like small size, very expensive HOA fees, bad neighborhoods, excessively far from city, or just old/bad quality.

The biggest cons I’m seeing are that I would be losing my current 3.5% interest rate and would be tying up almost all of my net worth in the house. The rest of my net worth is tied up in my 401k so I would have virtually no savings outside of those vehicles, such as in a taxable brokerage, other than my emergency fund. I currently have about $75k equity in my current home, $50k in a taxable brokerage, and the rest in various retirement accounts (taxable and retirement were much bigger before market downturn). I can save up another $100k easily in 6mon for a $200k downpayment 

Would it be worth upgrading my primary residence now or continue staying in my current condo for a little bit longer?  Although space is definitely tight, I can still make it work. It’s just not very comfortable",Should I upgrade to bigger house or stay where I’m at?

Hi all,

I am 24, originally from Ukraine, now I live in the US and have a green card.

I run an online teaching/consulting business that I have been growing for the last 7 years. Last year I made $175K, in 2021 it was $160K, in 2020 $120K. I think if i try hard, I could grow it to $250-300K, but probably it cannot scale beyond that. 

A part is active earned income (about $120 of last year’s 175K) and a part is income from my intellectual copyright property. That part is more or less guaranteed for the next 7-10 years.

Of this $175K, my tax bill is $45000, my spending is $40-45K, and I save the rest ($90 000). 

Here is the problem. I love Europe so much more. I traveled many countries, especially Eastern European ones, and love living there a lot better. And, I have a lot of friends all over Europe, including digital nomads.

Life in the US kind of sucks. It’s okay on a daily level, but the only walkable cities are expensive ones, and I want to stay frugal. Food is worse, entertainment is worse. To enjoy US as much I would enjoy Croatia or Spain, I need to spend exactly 5 times more or so.

My standard of living was higher even in Ukraine 5 years ago with $800 a month. Sure now I can buy a big house or car, but that doesn’t fix entertainment, food or weather. 

So, a part of me wants to move to Europe and surrender my green card. Especially if I could lower my taxes, not only would I save more by spending less, but also by wasting less in taxes! For example if my spending is cut by half with the same or better lifestyle and so is my tax bill (say, Bulgaria with a 10% flat tax), I will be saving $140 000 a year.

But, there are two problems with doing that.

1)Living in Ukraine, I had tremendous financial instrument problems. For example my clients couldn’t pay me cause PayPal wasn’t available, I couldn’t keep money in the bank because they go bankrupt and aren’t insured, I had no access to stock market or mortgages. 

So moving to a country like Montenegro with low taxes won’t solve this, while places like Lithuania, Portugal, or anything EU except a few exceptions are high tax. 

2)Citizenship. I could get a freelancer visa or even a Golden Visa soon, but I would prefer to work on citizenship, because the Ukrainian one is not safe and good enough.


But the biggest problem is my ambition. I am aware I am fortunate to have built this business. It’s amazing that at just 24 years old I could retire in most of the world! 

But, I want much more. I know people here in the US who make $5-10M a year, anywhere from finance to real estate. 

So, if I were to stay, I could start buying real estate. In 5 years, I could build a $3-5M portfolio cash flowing $100-200K a year extra and appreciating.

I think the US is not going to the right place, but it still offers the best protection and money creation tools unless you only build remotely. No other country offers fixed mortgages, you know your money will be safe, there will be no wealth tax, it’s easy to evict tenants. I know the American tax code, rules, laws and mentality and moving to Portugal, Bulgaria, Malta and whatnot will undermine these plans. It will take time to learn the local laws, locals have less money, it’s harder to work with the banks, etc. 

If I had a US citizenship, I would leave the country now, travel and leave in Europe, saving money with Foreign Earned Income Exemption, and would be building my real estate portfolio in the US. I would be coming to oversee the deals, and delegate the management.

So what should I do? The logical thing would be to surrender the green card now, and enjoy my best life. But the ambitious part of me would be very disappointed. I don’t have to be worth $50M in 15 years, but I know I have to be able to tell myself I did my best. 

Maybe start buying real estate and in 3.5 years take the citizenship and leave? If my earned income goes up so much that the US taxes become a problem, I would then renounce the citizenship and pay an exit tax.",Help choose the direction

2401,1,"Hello everyone. 

So a little background, I am 20 years old, I work in commission sales and make a bit over $100k/year. My monthly expenses total out to at or below $4k (typically closer to $3500). I have zero debt so no car payment and credit cards are paid in full every month. I am maxing out my Roth IRA and always have money left over even on bad sales months when I may only make $5-6k. My emergency fund is fully funded, if not a bit over funded. I like to have an extra cushion in my finances since I’m on commission. I’m sitting on about $35k in cash and about $10k in investments (and growing) so far. 

Now my question is this:
 
The gym has been a passion of mine for a long time. I have set some fairly massive income goals for this year and want to keep myself on track. I went with one of the older gentlemen I work with to the incredibly fancy gym he goes to and absolutely loved the experience. It has *everything* there from a massive area to lift weights, to a sauna, cold plunge, rooftop lap pool, cafe, massage room, etc etc. 

The downside is, it costs $200/ month. I know I can feasibly afford this, that’s no worry but I am struggling to justify it to myself no matter what. It is in a wealthy area and I am certainly a believer that if you want money you need to surround yourself with people who have money, and I think this is certainly a place where that applies. But besides that I do think it would benefit me to be able to have that trip everyday to a luxurious area of town and enjoy my workout / sauna &amp; cold plunge. It is no contract so I could always cancel.

I was using an online calculator yesterday and saw an ad for High Yield Savings accounts (Ally, Capital One, etc.) I noticed that most of the rates were between 3% and 4%. I know that Capital One has variable rates, but have neglected to keep tabs on the interest rate, so I thought that it was good that they're keeping pace with other banks (I joined ING, and when Capital One Acquired them, they weren't as good about keeping interest rates competitive.)

When I checked my Savings accounts, they were only paying a 0.3% interest. I checked them all, and reached out to a friend to confirm that I was reading it right - he had the same rate. When he contacted their support today, they said that the only way to get the 3.3% new rate is to open a new account and close the old one. (It appears that they ""Changed"" the account from ""360 Savings"" to ""360 Performance Savings"" - although that may be unrelated.)

I would recommend that people who are current Capital One customers investigate their situation and let the company know that not adjusting the existing customer's rates to match their advertised offerings is poor customer service and puts business at risk.

So I recently had to return my car and the dealership explained that buying it would be my best option for lowest payments. I thought OK let's do this because I need a car anyway. Car was leased under my mom's name because she had better credit at the time. So the salesman tells me it has to be bought under her name to qualify for the 0 down buying option. I figure no big deal, I'll have her come sign the papers. He tells me the final number is looking like 590 a month! I ask why and he says her credit is too low and she was financed at 18%. I'm panicking but I need a car, and the lease options are higher than that so I say OK.. thinking I can sell the car in a few months and see what to do then. I'm an idiot I know, but I've also got my 2 kids with me, one of which is a baby and I'm juggling all of this so my brain is just telling me to finish this up. 

My mom comes and I need to get the baby changed so I tell her I haven't read the itemized pricing yet so don't sign that. She says OK she'll do that last. Well she signed anyway. Apparently the salesman just got her to sign all the papers quickly since the price was agreed upon. At this point there is no turning back. My lease end price was 17k and somehow between the mileage charge and dealership fee and other shit it ended up at 25k! How the fuck? 

So I'm stuck financing a 25k car at 18% interest. I WANT TO CRY. I don't know what to do because the contract clearly states there is no cooling off period, meaning once it's signed, it's binding. Am I going to have to sell this shit and take the hit of the difference? Like if I sell it for 20k I'm only on the hook for the other 5k? Or is the interest also due at once?

It has come to the point where I am a bit confused and in the middle of deciding whether to continue to invest in a Roth 401k (which I have been doing since graduating), and a Traditional 401k, which I believe I should start taking advantage of.

As of the end of 2022, here’s where I am:
- Age: 25
- Living: IL (4.95% state income)
- $153k Salary
- $130k NW: $30k HYSA (big purchases soon), $20k brokerage, $60k Roth’s, $10k Traditionals, $10k other (crypto, bonds, HSA, etc)

Future plans:
- Will likely marry in next 3 years, new combined income will be $225k+
- Expecting personal salary increase in 2023 to $165k+

I plan on maxing out 401k contributions in 2023. 

Based on everything I’ve read, I believe I am very close to being better suited for a traditional account because of my low(er) state income, high(er) tax bracket, and a large enough safety net of Roth when needed for larger distributions in retirement. However, some posts here have recommended that the 28%+ tax brackets are where traditionals help, and I’m also at a loss of trying to understand since I am so heavily invested how much my distributions will need to be in retirement. 

With this - I am leaning towards a 60/40 Roth/Traditional split, but am not super confident in this decision. I do believe a split of some sort is going to be right.

My salary is $85,000 and I’ve been taking home roughly $5,100 monthly after taxes. I started working in September 2022.


Monthly expenses with new 2023 budget and a few explanations after:

**Rent:** I live at home, but pay my family $400 monthly for my bedroom. 


**Car:** The car I’m driving now is technically not mine. It’s in my family’s name and the understanding is that it’s “mine” as long as I pay the monthly payments and eventually give them more for the “equity” I’m getting in it. 


It’s a 2015 4Runner with 95k miles. It’s completely decked out and worth $23-25k. My family has a 2.3% loan on it with $5,100 left. They want an additional $7,500 for them to officially sell it to me. 


I love the car and think it’ll be a great vehicle for me to drive until the wheels fall off. I’m not sure what the best strategy is in terms of financing it in my name (interest rates are quite high rn), so for the time being I’ve been paying their monthly payments and at some point will need to take out a loan. Any input here is appreciated!


**Food:** The $380 on eating out is partially me eating out a few times a week. It’s also a mix of me paying weekly to take my siblings out to eat and I’ve also had a few expensive meals. I took my dad to a nice dinner for his birthday ($200) and paid for my entire family on my grandmother’s birthday ($300). I enjoy taking my siblings out and want to continue, but limit to once a month or so this upcoming year. 


**Clothes:** I have gone overboard here. I work in a somewhat formal setting and didn’t have a decent wardrobe. I got several expensive silk blouses, wool pants, expensive shoes, backpack, and suitcase. This definitely was just an upfront cost thing and I don’t plan to be spending this much monthly here on out. 


**Other Comments:** I pulled all of my credit card transactions to make this monthly breakdown. It doesn’t completely add up to what I’ve taken home.

2432,1,"Considering replacing my high mileage, 2006 Honda with a new vehicle this year. 

Either a Honda CRV Hybrid Sport 2WD or Toyota RAV4 Hybrid AWD (all Rav4 hybrid are all wheel drive, but I don't particularly need AWD). 

I have located a Honda dealer willing to sell an inbound CRV at MSRP 33695 + 995 dealer fee + tax/tags/etc. 

I have located a Toyota dealer willing to order from allocation a RAV4 at MSRP from their pipeline; unsure if any have factory accessories or packages, but the RAV4 without anything is 33570. This dealer has no fees, no markups, etc. Sticker + tax/tags/etc.  

Neither dealer can quote rates because it will depend what is offered at the time the vehicle actually arrives.  Rates are a little stupid now in general, but I should qualify for whatever the lowest offered is.  hoping to be somewhere around 5-6% on a 60 month loan. 

I would put 0 down, am not trading in my 2006 Honda. 

With taxes, fees, license, registration, it seems like I would be financing 36K and with an interest rate of 6% be paying right around $700 per month for total of payments after 5 years coming to approx 42K.  

Household income (myself and wife): $134,000 base up to 164,000 (part of my pay is variable commission plan).

Other income: **$1300 month dividends** but currently set to DRIP instead of using as income

I also am **reimbursed 62.5 cents per mile that I drive for work**. My current vehicle averages 20 mpg, the new hybrids are both approx 35 mpg, so my cost to operate them drops .  I can drive anywhere from 100 - 400 miles per week for work, but let's use 200 as an average. 800 miles per month is $500 reimbursed.  Fuel cost for 800 miles at 35 MPG and $3.50 per gallon is $80. My net reimbursement to cover car cost/depreciation/maintenance would therefore be about $420 per month. 

Cash accounts: $205K

Debt / Obligations

* Mortgage 245K at 2.625%. Insurance is insane on the house. PITI is **$2000** month. 
* Wifes car; 2020 Toyota financed at 2.99%.  Owe $12.5k on it, car has a fair market value of 20-22k, so no rush to pay faster.  Payment is **$410** per month currently
* Other expenses: Household bills (lawn care, electric, water company, pest control, cable, etc) **$400**
* FL Prepaid university/UTMA investing/529 savings contribution - **$300** 
* Groceries - **$500** 
* Car Insurance (paid 2x per year); 3 cars = **$500** per month combined.  

So that's a **little over $4000 per month in obligations**; maybe can save a bit on groceries, or step down the UTMA and 529 contributions (not likely to do so) but overall, not much we can do to alter our monthly ""nut"".  

Is $700 a month for a new vehicle payment within our range or is it irresponsible/unaffordable? Is it time to retire the 2006 Honda, or try to go another year or two? I have seen a huge increase in vehicle prices in past 2 years, not talking markups or addendums, but MSRP increases, and I don't think they will stop.

2440,1,"Looking for guidance on whether and when to file IRS Form 709 (U.S. Gift Tax Form) for a $10k I-Bond gift purchase for a non-spouse family member. As I understand the IRS rules, each person has an annual gift tax exclusion amount for “present interest” gifts to each non-spouse recipient (16,000 in 2022 and $17,000 in 2023).  However, there is a $0 limit on “future interest” gifts to non-spouse recipients, and you must file a gift tax return when you give “future interest” gifts to anyone except your spouse. 

It’s not clear to me whether I-Bonds you purchase as a gift for a non-spouse individual (using their SSN and TD account #) in 2022 but hold for delivery to that individual in 2023 count as a “present interest” gift in 2022 or a “future interest” gift in 2023.  In this case, a $10k “present interest” gift appears to not require Form 709 be filed, but a $10k “future interest” gift would require Form 709 (and in tax year 2022 or 2023?).

2441,1,"Hello,

I would love some advice on a savings conundrum…

I currently earn £70k per year but this is due to increase to £80k in February. I have £10k outstanding on my student loan, currently paying off around  £380 via salary repayments per month which is due to rise to just under £450 with my pay rise. The interest rate on student loans has just risen to 3.25% in-line with inflation. So will take me about another 2 years to pay off if I continue just salary repayments. I have never made any direct payments to my student loan.

I am also 16 weeks pregnant. I have been saving £500 per month for the past 5 months for our baby in a 5% interest savings account (currently have £2.5k). The original goal being to save up £10k between my partner and I to go towards nursery fees/ baby expenses by the time the baby is born.  I will have 6 months paid maternity leave from work so don’t need to worry too much about maternity leave, and most baby stuff we’ll be getting second hand/ getting some money from relatives so don’t need too much extra ££ for that as we can probably cover with our salaries.

However now that I have a sizeable chunk saved I’ve been looking at my student loan repayments and thinking…imagine having that extra £450 per month. I would really feel that - it would really cushion the blow with future nursery fees AND if I had it by the time I go on maternity leave I could potentially stretch my pay out for 9 months rather than 6.

So now I’m thinking, what’s the point of saving for the future when I could be overpaying student loan now and increase my salary by 10%?

So should I pay the £2.5k saved directly into my student loan and continue to divert £500/month to that instead, with a view to pay it off by the time I go on maternity leave in July? Leaving me with an extra £450pm from then onwards?

Other option is to continue saving £500pm in my 5% interest account until I reach the 5k limit.",Save £500pm in 5% interest savings account or pay off student loan (UK)

2457,1,"Hey all,

I made a bit of an error 3 days ago (12/30) when paying my Amex credit card bill online for a card I seldom use. When I was using the Amex app to make the payment ($30), I had noticed my saved checking account wasn't showing up. No biggie, I'll just enter it again. This is where I messed up by accidentally omitting one digit of my account number. The routing number was fine, since it showed the correct bank associated with my account. I had only noticed the error after I submitted the payment. At this point, I figured it'd probably just bounce since it's likely not a valid account. However, the Amex online system now shows the payment as ""paid"" (no funds were taken by amex from my account). So I call Amex to see if I can get the payment reversed and refunded since I'd assumed it was a real account that was debited. However, the support rep processes the refund to my actual account, and not to the ""fake/mistake"" account number that I erroneously inputted. I'm now being told that I have to wait a few business days before processing another credit refund. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that phone call I figure I might as well call my bank and see if they can help. My bank has an automated phone system that requests your account number when calling. Turns out, if you enter an account number that's invalid/not associated with an account, the automated system says ""it could not find an account with that number"" or something along those lines. When you enter a valid account number, it instead prompts you to enter your pin to access account information. Out of curiosity, I enter the number I had erroneously entered for payment to see what my bank's system would say, and it says it couldn't find an account with that number. So assuming the number I entered into the phone system was the ""fake/mistake"" number I made payment with, why would Amex mark it as ""paid"" when the payment was made with an invalid account.

2469,1,"Hi all,

I'm 36 and was recently diagnosed with bulbar onset ALS.  I'm married to a 34 year old, have a two year old and we are due for our second child shortly.  Both my wife and I were high earners (our income has been scaling rapidly over the last 7-8 years) and saved about 40% of our take home annually.  I have a good amount of long term disability and life insurance.  My wife also makes a lot of money and I have some family in the area and plenty of friends who will help us out with my care when it becomes necessary (along with hired caregivers).  So, unlike for a lot of people with ALS, this will likely not be financially devastating for my family.  But, our finances are going to be weird for a little bit.  Our expenses are going to go through the roof for a few years, but then we are going to end up with a very large cash infusion when I die.  So, we need some help thinking through how to come up with a financial plan for a more complicated situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I have done all of the budgeting/investing for our family.  My wife is happy to stick within budgets, but just has absolutely no interest or inclination to budget herself or dig into the details of personal finance.  Additionally, she will be a single mother to two young children and working a high paying very demanding job.  She is going to have extremely minimal time and we should try to outsource everything we can that isn't job, time with the kids, social activities, etc.  We have been following, and are firm believers in, the simple indexed fund approach, so we aren't looking for/don't need someone to put us in exotic investments.  What we really need is someone to help us think through the next couple of years, and someone to help review finances with my wife on a quarterly/semi-annual basis.

2474,1,"This is a long read. So I apologize in advance but I want to get as much info in here as possible…  I  bought a used 2018 Wrangler JKU back in 2021… I love Wranglers (I know that many do not for one reason or 50 but I digress) 

Basically, I want to trade my 18JKU in for a 2023 JLU, this particular JLU has every bell and whistle my JKU doesn’t… it only has 25 miles on it, it is completely updated and up-fit with a factory Mopar kit (lift, wheels, shocks, tires etc) all the stuff I would normally do myself. Done and covered under factory warranty. It’s beautiful and mint and again…  brand spanking new.

I’ll get to the meat and potato’s already … I am considering a balloon loan - it’s the only thing holding me back from pulling the trigger. Why a balloon loan? The monthly on a regular finance would have me looking at very high monthly payments which doesn’t fit into my budget. Right now I finance my used car at $447 a month (just for comparison sake)  I put a small hold on the car on NYE and now I’ve just been thinking and thinking. I have nearly an 800 credit score as of today. While I sat at the dealership spitballing and sharing stories, I was informed that I was approved for a monthly payment through a CU for $431 dollars a month, which is less than what I pay now, the interest rate is %6.99 (I know that’s high but was expecting higher considering the state of the world) at the end of the balloon I would owe a little over 24k since the car comes out to 52k after all is said and done with the positive equity of my current vehicle trade value etc.

My thing is I tend to think on the catastrophic scale like, what if I lose my job and can’t find another? What if I fall into ill health, what if I can’t meet that 24k balloon in 5 years? My girlfriend understands my hesitation, at the same time she tells me “the positive is it’s a brand new car, yours already has had issues, and if everyone lived worrying about the future they’d never do anything in the now… also, we know the Wrangler would sell given their reputation, resale value and fan base.”

I know before the balloon comes within five years of saving (if I don’t get fired or something bad happens) that I’d have the money to pay it off if I continue the path I am on… but again - what if something happens. The salesman gave me his shtick of how his girlfriend balloons every 2-3 years with her Wrangler. Sure. But even if I have the 24k all saved up nice and warm what if I don’t want to dump that hard saved money into the final balloon payment?? I could refinance - yes… I could potentially sell the car, yes… but all these questions. Plainly put, is this balloon loan a dumb a** idea? Am I  going to ruin my finances? Is it going to destroy my credit that I work so diligently to maintain and protect? Should I just walk away? I know at the end of the day the final choice is mine… but man, I need advice. My cousin in law who is a good 20+ years older than me and has bought and sold and financed and has more experience with this said “it’s not really beneficial but whatever you choose to do I support you.” So I don’t have much going except the voice in my head saying “do it! It’s a new car, gone are the issues of the old one” vs “well new cars still have issues too and this a totally different type of loan”

4. Open and Max Contribute to Roth IRA for each of us (Starting May/24)

5. Start saving monthly (HYSA) for max lump payment for following year's Roth IRA contributions

6. Max out my wife’s 401k over the employer match (I think up to 12%)

7. Open a (60%-20%-20%) three-fund portfolio with VTSAX ($9000), VBTLX ($3000), and VTIAX ($3000) (Exp. Completion 5/25)

8. Pay $1000 a month into three fund portfolio at $600-$200-$200 (Starting 8/25)

At this point I would be 49 years old.

9. Start paying off house (at this point I would owe approximately $118,000 at 2.99%)

&amp;#x200B;

Part of my struggle is, do I want the independence of having my house paid off sooner instead of investing earlier? I want my investments to have some time to grow, but the prospect of not having a house payment is attractive.

2523,1,"What is cash-out refinancing?

If you have equity in your home and need cash, you may be able to refinance your mortgage and get cash out. This is called a “cash-out” refinance.  


To be eligible for a cash-out refinance, you’ll need to have good credit and enough equity in your home. The amount of equity you have is the difference between the balance of your mortgage loan and the appraised value of your home.  


The new mortgage loan you’ll get from a cash-out refinance will be larger than your current mortgage loan. You’ll use the extra money to pay off other debts, make home improvements, or invest in something else.  


Before you decide to do a cash-out refinance, make sure you understand all the costs involved and weigh the pros and cons carefully.

## Pros and cons of cash-out refinancing

If you’re a homeowner with equity in your property, cash-out refinancing allows you to tap into that equity and receive cash in hand. It’s one way to use your home equity, but it’s not always the best option.  


There are some pros to cash-out refinancing, including the potential to:  


• Get a lower interest rate: If rates have gone down since you first took out your mortgage, you could save money by refinancing at a lower rate.  


• Reduce your monthly payments: If you’re struggling to make ends meet each month, lowering your payments can give you some breathing room.  


• Pay off high-interest debt: If you have credit card debt or other loans with high interest rates, you can potentially save money by using the cash from your refinance to pay off those debts.  


However, there are also some cons to consider before taking out a cash-out refinance, including:  


• You could end up owing more than your home is worth: If housing prices go down after you take out a cash-out refinance, you could find yourself “underwater” on your mortgage – owing more than your home is worth. This can make it difficult to sell or refinance if you need to do so in the future.  


• There are closing costs involved: As with any type of loan, there are closing costs associated with a cash-out refinance. These can add up

[https://mortgagedrill.com/cash-out-refinancing-is-one-way-to-turn-your-home-equity-into-cash-but-not-everyone-qualifies/](https://mortgagedrill.com/cash-out-refinancing-is-one-way-to-turn-your-home-equity-into-cash-but-not-everyone-qualifies/)

## How to qualify for cash-out refinancing

To qualify for a cash-out refinance, you’ll generally need to get your home appraised. The appraisal is an important part of the equation because it determines the maximum value of your home and, as a result, how much equity you have.  


In addition to needing equity, you’ll need to prove that you can make the monthly payments on your loan. Lenders will want to see proof of income, employment history, and credit score. They’ll also want to know what your current debts are and your debt-to-income ratio.  


If everything looks good and you’re able to meet all the requirements, you should be able to qualify for a cash-out refinance.

## Alternatives to cash-out refinancing

If you’re looking to access your home equity but don’t qualify for a cash-out refinance, there are a few other options available to you.  


Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) provide flexible access to funds, allowing you to borrow only what you need and making interest-only payments on the amount borrowed. However, HELOCs typically come with variable interest rates, so your monthly payments could increase or decrease over time.  


Another option is a home equity loan, which is a lump sum of cash that’s repaid over a fixed period of time at a fixed interest rate. Home equity loans can be used for one-time expenses like home renovations or debt consolidation.  


Finally, if you have good credit and enough equity in your home, you may be able to get a cash-out refinance with a private lender. Private lenders usually offer higher interest rates than banks or credit unions, but they may be more flexible with their eligibility requirements.","Cash-out refinancing is one way to turn your home equity into cash, but not everyone qualifies"

2541,1,"I was recently introduced to the Texas County District and Retirement System. This is a retirement savings plan offered to Texas government employees at all levels across the state. 

As far as I can tell, it seems to be essentially a fixed annuity. But I’m not clear beyond that. A few of my questions are: 

- Am I correct in characterizing this as an annuity?
- Assuming it is a fixed annuity, is it offered through insurance companies (like a typical annuity), or backed by the Texas government itself? 
- When is employer matching applied? At vesting, or at retirement? 
- When electing to “begin retirement”, if I chose not to take the regular payments and instead rolled a lump-sum disbursement of the account into an IRA, would that sum include the employer match? 

Right now, I am imagining the following: if I am fully vested, my employer match is 225%, I currently have $100,000 in my account, and I elect to begin my retirement benefits, then at that time my (now previous) employer adds an additional $225,000 to my account. That brings my total balance to $325,000, which either (a) becomes the basis for calculating the fixed payment lifetime benefit, or (b) becomes available to me as a lump sum (if I so choose) that I can roll over into an IRA and continue to invest myself.

Future Goals:

We have no current desire to FIRE or retire early. I want to work as long as possible and build generational wealth, or simply make as much money as possible. Ideally, We’d like to retire with ~$60-80mm, counting the inheritances. I understand that I am only 22 and very naive.

My question to the people on here is how to approach this. I see a lot of posts on this subreddit about people in difficult financial situations and very few about building wealth. In terms of savings, We’re just going to pour it all in index funds. I do not have the time or willpower to manage real estate, and the benefits of real estate only become significant for very high earners and UHNW individuals. Is there any other advice people who have taken a similar approach to their finances (building generational wealth) can provide? When I do the math in excel, with my and my future spouses incomes, my goal seems extremely feasible , perhaps even too easy. However, obviously, very few people retire with 60-80 million so I’m curious what I’m missing. On the kids front, we do want kids and I understand that kids are extremely expensive.

Or would it make more sense to have a Roth IRA along with my checking and savings account to begin with and avoid a separate index fund?

Monthly expenses with a few explanations after:

|Total|$3160|$2792|

**Rent:** I live at home, but pay my family $400 monthly for my bedroom. 

**Car:** The car I’m driving now is technically not mine. It’s in my family’s name and the understanding is that it’s “mine” as long as I pay the monthly payments and eventually give them more for the “equity” I’m getting in it. 

It’s a 2015 4Runner with 95k miles. It’s completely decked out and worth $23-25k. My family has a 2.3% loan on it with $5,100 left. They want an additional $7,500 for them to officially sell it to me. 

I love the car and think it’ll be a great vehicle for me to drive until the wheels fall off. I’m not sure what the best strategy is in terms of financing it in my name (interest rates are quite high rn), so for the time being I’ve been paying their monthly payments and at some point will need to take out a loan. Any input here is appreciated!

**Food:** The $380 on eating out is partially me eating out a few times a week. It’s also a mix of me paying weekly to take my siblings out to eat and I’ve also had a few expensive meals. I took my dad to a nice dinner for his birthday ($200) and paid for my entire family on my grandmother’s birthday ($300). I enjoy taking my siblings out and want to continue, but limit to once a month or so this upcoming year. 

**Clothes:** I have gone overboard here. I work in a somewhat formal setting and didn’t have a decent wardrobe. I got several expensive silk blouses, wool pants, expensive shoes, backpack, and suitcase. This definitely was just an upfront cost thing and I don’t plan to be spending this much monthly here on out. 

**Other Comments:** I pulled all of my credit card transactions to make this monthly breakdown. It doesn’t completely add up to what I’ve taken home. I’ve combined a few things here and there, I have around $7,000 in my savings account right now. My company matches 25% of the first 6% for 401k. I also don't currently have a Roth IRA but plan to open one soon. 

**Student Loans:** I have $27,000 in federal student loans and my family has a $12,500 parent plus loan I'll pay. These are all on deferment until August 2023.

I wasn't sure if they would still be up and running, didn't want to put $into it if that could happen..my concerns were all there. But the no fees and no balance issue sounds really nice.

Age 42; married; wife does not earn income; older kids from wife's first marriage (she's 12 years older than me) but they are out of the house and require no support.

Salary: $220k base with bonus between $8k-10k; 3% 401k match; employee plus spouse gold healthcare plan paid 100%.

Mortgage: $366k mortgage (FMV $515k) at 2.75% (1 year into 30-year refinance we did last year to get that rate); $2,154 monthly payment with $622 of that going to escrow.

Student loans: $107k at 6%; $10k at 7%; $18k at 4.45%.

Savings: $35k in traditional savings account.

Retirement: $6k in 401k; $6k in Acorns account (aggressive); $1k in Fidelity traditional IRA (spread among a few Vanguard funds).

Current savings plan is:

\- maxing out 401k ($22,500) to get employer match ($6,600);

\- maxing out traditional IRA ($6,500) and backdooring to Roth at the end of every year;

\- putting $2,600/month into Acorns account.

Please assume that the above is the maximum my current budget will allow.  The student loan payments are paused so it's easy to not bother with those at the moment, but when the resume, obviously it makes sense to start paying those down as aggressively as possible, shifting the entire $2600/month from Acorns into those payments.

Goal: to retire between 60-65 with $2M or more.  The ""or more"" is flexible based on the retirement year since the earlier I go the longer I'll have to float before I draw social security.  My preliminary plan is to wait until 70 to get the max.

My questions:

\- Would it be better to pay the mortgage down or to continue buying as the market falls with the expectation that we'll see the upswing as we did following 2008?

\- Shifting the $35k I have in savings into an online high interest savings account is a no-brainer, right?

\- How would you game out a retirement savings plan based on the above numbers?

The goal seems achievable, but I'm very much a novice as to all saving and investing options, so I want to see if I'm missing anything obvious (or not so obvious).

I've recently paid off a personal debt consolidation loan for some medical debt and poor choices in my 20s, and the Kay Jewelers card is paid off.

Happy New Year!
       I'm posting this here because I frankly think this topic deserves some sort of place within both financial goals and student loan debt considerations.I am currently 44 y.o., single, with no kids and need to return to school for a bachelor's. Though I'm just now starting taxes and final figures haven't come yet, between two jobs, l earned a bit more than 75K last year. My current FT  is a 5 yr contract gig with 3 yrs left on it. I never expected to earn this, but while I'm making it, I wanted my empolyers' matches (both employers match retirement funds in pre-tax money).  What I am just now realizing is what a mess this might leave me in with regard to my REPAYE plan. I first attempted school in the late 90's, but didn't finish due to borrowing limits. At the time, I was faxed with the choice of either borrowing privately or repaying the debt. Ever since, I've been on a roller coaster of repayment woes, but during this payment pause, I've paid ~21K on my one time high of 69K of srudent loan debt. The Dept of Ed says they're expecting recertification in June? Sept?, and I'm now concerned that I won't qualify. 

Since I recently decided to return to school, I've been trying to reshape my finances to suit a FAFSA.  Needless to say, my EFC needs work. But the school I've chosen is an in-state public one, so it's fairly affordable at ~ 2K per semester and I can basically afford to pay cash for a while. If there is one lesson I learned from the first time around , it's following the advice that school shouldn't cost more than I'm able to earn in 3-5 yrs.

I'm STEM, so my old classes are too old to receive credit for. I'm basically starting over, and I kind of need to make quick work of things, as my FT contract will end and put me back into the job market in 3 yrs. With that said, I've been in healthcare and am hopefully prepping for nursing school, so the transition will be brutal, but hopefully relatively brief.

I need these results to be FAFSA friendly. I may have elderly parents living with me at spme point, but I am a self supporting non traditional student.

Here's what I'm working with currently:

401K and 403B- about 50/50 Roth/before tax ~78K
Roth IRA -5K
529- new
Savings of various kinds ~ 15K 
Taxable brokerage (liquidating to move into 529)-9K


All the reading I've done recently about making a transition like this says that I basically need to spend down the cash, which includes an emergency fund, a new car fund and the like, which I'm basically not ready to do yet. I don't want to delay starting school for aforementioned reasons, but I need to ensure that as I cut back gradually from work, my income is moving in the right downward direction down and/or more ""Roth-like"" to avoid non qualified FAFSA income while my bills stay paid.

I also slowed down on student loan repayment now that at least I've paid almost all the capitalized interest I've accrued to date. Whenever interest restarts, hopefully I will have struck a decent balance between saving for a return to school in my 529 and dropping my amt owed to a decent level that I can pay while in school.

2. If I do convert a rollover into Roth, all the funds get moved over but I have to pay taxes from my savings account based on the income bracket at the time of conversion?
3. Once I convert rollover into a Roth, I can still contribute $6500 for 2023?
4. Do I have to accept the losses in the rollover at the time of conversion (eg. All my current rollover funds are in VTWAX this year which is down ~20%, if I wish to convert I have to sell them and take the loss)?

Was pre-approved for a loan with my wife. After a year of being out-offered on houses (about 15 offers on houses), we finally got an offer accepted. It seems like a blessing in disguise as it’s the area where we wanted to live in because the schooling is great for our daughter when she’s older.

Because it’s been so long finding a house, I slacked big time on preparing my bank statements for months…after reading on Reddit and google and what not, it seems lenders will deny me instantly for my bank statement alone because it’ll seem I spend way too much. But I hope they know it’s because we live at my parents and aren’t paying rent, so I’ve had extra money to spend (and also spent money on gambling that I shouldn’t have). But I figured as long as I pay my CC every month, it wouldn’t matter cause I’ll make back whatever I lose. (I’ve also deleted the gambling app the second I was approved) it was moreso my form of entertainment rather going to bars.

My DTI is 9%. My CC debt is like 300$ (which I can essentially pay off right now) and my car payment is like 300$ a month. I also pay 350$ on storage fees for our belongings (obviously that’ll end once we get into a home). I also have enough money for the down deposit, closing costs and a few months of mortgage payments in my savings.

I guess I’m just really worried about my bank statements with the spending this year living at my parents (November I gambled a bit too much, probably 2000$) and wondering if my DTI will save me, along with being on the loan with my wife? Or will they instantly deny me because of how many times I’ve gambled?

I do want to own a home (either in New England or the Mediterranean) within about 5-7 years. I do want to leave the sales world and do something more creative - I have professional experience in luxury travel sales and a strong (though amateur) taste in architectural preservation and architectural history - I'm hoping to blend these two into a sustainable career. Part of the reason for dual citizenship is to open the door to a master's in an arch. history field without much of a cost for me (as I'll be a European with ""in-state"" tuition). Trying to find a way to monetize my architectural/historical interests to the degree of money I could be making if I continue to hop upwards in the tech sales world (which can be very lucrative, in the $300k range at certain companies where I have some connections).

However, I'm not writing here for advice on my career path (unless you feel inclined to advise on that as well) - I'm more so asking where I should place the $45k now that I have it, and how it could best work for me as I pursue these medium term goals.

I'm not sure if this the correct sub. I have a CPA and my business has been open since September 2022. I can't figure out what to do now that my business is open.

I'm 32 and opened a Roth last year for the first time. I plan to max it out but that's all I have. I have $1k remaining to max out. Emergency fund is $2k.

I'd like to start planning for retirement but I'd also like to have more money put away for the business, like the $100k. As a business owner can I create a 401k for myself? And if so, how do I go about doing this? Is it too early?

2699,1,"My bag was lost 2 weeks ago on a nonstop flight. I left 12/15 and arrived home on 12/26. The airline sent it to my original destination on 12/29, despite me telling them I'd be home 12/26.

The airline asked me to go to the airport in my city and pick it up between 11am and 12pm today, 1/1. Basically the flight came in at 11am with my bag and they had no other flights that day, so staff was leaving at 12pm. I had to cancel new years day plans to meet this 11am-12pm window. I found my bag at the baggage claim today. I never saw an employee, otherwise I would've probably complained. I tried to see someone at the front desk, to no avail. Their phone number for the airport doesn't even work. 

I've talked to corporate customer service over a messenger app, as that is the only means of communication with this airline. They had me complete a form with receipts about items I bought because of the lost bag, as well as items in the bag. I haven't heard back in almost 1 week.

As far as they know, my bag could still be missing and/or stolen. I'm usually someone who plays by the rules, and my original plan was to only ask for reimbursement for the items I had to purchase for the 2 weeks my bag was missing, then just move on.

However, I'm tempted to use their bad customer service/bag tracking abilities against them. I'm just not sure how. What should I do? Insist that my bag is missing still? Maybe they will offer a greater refund. Being without my bag for 2 weeks and receiving near radio silence from the airline was very unsettling. That bag had food I made for my family in it (which is disgusting now). It had developed family photographs from 2008 I thought were gone for good. It had christmas gifts I had to replace. Sure, they will reimburse the things I repurchased, but what about the stress? What about requiring me to pick it up? What about the shitty, careless customer service? What about sending it to my 12/15 destination on 12/29, when I was already back home? To top it off, for a nonstop flight!

2700,1,"TL;DR: My job (travel nurse agency for this year) never contributed to my 401k. My paystubs say 401k and has 15% of each weekly check as the number, but it never went to any 401k. Just stayed in my check. What are my options?

Hey all,

I am a travel nurse and I am currently working for a travel agency that isn't ""based"" in the US. I say ""based"" because they have an office here, but it looks to be in some run down building based on google maps. All of the employees are indian and my recruiter seems to be based out of india based on the times she calls/texts me.

When signing up with the agency, under their benefits page it asked me how much I wanted to contribute to my 401k and I put in 15% of each check. Thought everything was done.

I checked my first check and saw 15% of my pay went to my 401k (there's a line item that says 401k plan - $_ _ _. _ _). I thought great. I don't tend to check my 401k and especially didn't want to this year d/t the volatility of it.

I logged into my account today and saw the total and was shocked at how it was. It was less than the last time I looked at the beginning of the year. I know, my fault for not checking.

But then I looked back at my checks and it seems that despite it saying money was placed in a 401k, it looks like it never went anywhere. My checks are the same size as if there was no 401k line item.

I work in different states with different rates so my checks are always fluctuating so I didn't really notice.

I have always been financially stable and chalk that up to my dad who has always advised me and to my own business degree. While I do have debt, I am actively paying it off. I do love to spend money and am not always the most conservative when it comes down to it. 

My boyfriend was not afforded the same education in finances as I was. It seems like he can’t stand to have $1 in his pocket. He has made big steps forward throughout our relationship and I commend him for that. 

Here’s my dilemma. A few years before we met, he burned his foot badly. I think he was around 22/23 yrs old. Badly enough to where he had to be taken to the nearest burn unit in SA, TX on an army base. (He is not in the armed forces, but that’s where it was). From what I’m told they had to sign a bunch of paperwork for him to be seen and he was in such pain that they just signed whatever so he could be seen. Come to find out he wasn’t on any sort of insurance. 

Now he has $25,000 of medical debt owed to the department of defense. 

He has called to talk with them about a plan and well they aren’t really accommodating to say the least. Our options were to pay in full, have a payment plan of $700/month (which we can’t afford), or (in his words) send them a check and hope it’s enough to settle. 

My first question is: would they really just tell us to send them a check in hopes it’ll be enough? Or did he misunderstand them? Bc it’s been a sore spot for a bit. 

Secondly: what are our options? I’ve tried looking into it but I can only get so far since we aren’t married.

I plan to work my entire career within this retirement system. The plan requires me to wait until age 65 to draw in order to earn the full benefit.

It was a tough time for us with her having two surgeries (knee, kidney stones) and a high deductible health plan not being a whole lot of help. More than that, I finally got her to disclose to her parents that she had $24,000 in credit card debt, almost all accumulated before our 2021 marriage. It's no longer used.

We are expected to pay the loan back this month, but there was never any strict number attached to how much to pay per month. It was more like pay what you can.

The problem is that the loan, generous as it was, didn't really help a whole lot. It knocked the minimum credit card payment down $30/month, kind of like a drop in the bucket.

2715,1,"A few years ago I bought a $7,500 Subaru Outback as a broke college student with plans for it to last 5 years and then buy a Tacoma. Unfortunately, it's on its last legs 2 years earlier than planned.  I'm looking to get a car in the next couple months and would like some advice.

For background, I work as a remote software engineer in the mountains.  I don't drive the car much on a day to day basis other than groceries, going to the gym, etc.  However, I very frequently drive on rough roads for mountain biking, backcountry skiing, camping, desert climbing trips, etc.

Monthly budget:

* Monthly take home pay after max 401k for company match, taxes, etc:  $5800
* Rent + utilities + wifi: $1800
* Food: $300
* Gym + subscriptions: $100
* Random things that come up: $300-$400
* Everything else gets thrown in a HYSA while I build up emergency fund and savings for car

Financials:

* Credit score: 800
* \~4 month emergency fund
* $16,000 saved for a car down payment sitting in a HYSA

The problem is, I have \~$40,000 of student loans. $20k private at 4.2% and $20k federal at 4.4%. Since graduating a year ago, I've only paid \~$300 a month towards the private loans while building up an emergency fund and a little bit of savings. I haven't paid anything on the federal loans because they're all deferred and not accruing interest for now anyways.

My question is, what type of car should I get? The dream is a new Tacoma because it would allow me to do all the hobbies I like, they last forever, and they retain their value super well.  I'd have no problem keeping the car for the next 250,000+ miles. This would be roughly \~$40,000.  I thought about used ones, but they hold their value so well that used Tacomas are insanely expensive.

Another alternative is a new Subaru Outback for \~$32,0000. This would get me most of the way with my hobbies, but I know I would eventually want to upgrade for more off-roading capabilities and truck stuff. I'm not sure how much money I would be losing in the long term if I know that I'm going to want to upgrade in the relatively near future anyways.

3rd alternative would be buying a used beater Outback or something similar with all cash. My concern with this is that while it is getting better, the used car market is still ridiculous.  I'm still scarred from dumping money on maintenance into my current car only for it to die in a couple years while also not letting me go all the places I want to go.  Plus, there are huge maintenance costs that tend to pop up around 100k miles (head gaskets, etc).

What are your thoughts? Am I ridiculous and in need of a reality check for even considering a new Tacoma right now with my loans? Is there another alternative I haven't considered? Thanks!",New vs used vs beater car w/ student loans. How much should I spend?

With the recent news that the Supreme Court won’t be listening to oral arguments until the end of Feb 2023 (with a true decision probably coming much later), I have been trying to do some research on what short term, safe investments are available to me. I know the returns won’t be anything special, but they will probably be better than just keeping it all in savings. 

So far, the options I have seen are HYSA, CDs, and T-Bills. Since I have a few months, I was eyeing the 13 week T-Bills as a safe investment that have a decent yield currently (Vanguard lists the APY as 4.4%). My thought process being I put in maybe $35k of the $46k I have saved into the bills for that 13-week period and get whatever return I can while still keeping my investment very safe. My question basically is am I thinking over this enough? I was keeping around $10k related to this student loans savings in case something bad were to happen. Is that really possible or should I still feel comfortable putting that entire amount in T-Bills? Or should I be using a different investment vehicle entirely?

2731,1,"Hi all - I'm new to investing and just screwed up my first backdoor Roth IRA conversion. Early in December 2022, I made a traditional IRA, contributed $6000 of after-tax money, and rolled it all over to my Roth IRA while telling Fidelity to close the traditional IRA. Today I logged in and noticed the traditional IRA was back with about $7 of funds from dividends paid out on December 30th. Now I'm worried about the pro-rata rule (which I don't understand) and don't know what to do with that $7 of dividends since it's now 2023.

2747,1,"Hey all,  


I'm 26 and I'm seeking to retire as soon as possible in a relatively safe way.  


I'm making $56,000 a year, but if you factor my employer contributions for retirement, I make $61,160. My employer puts 10% of my salary towards my retirement plan and I put an additional 5% out of my base $56,000 a year towards my retirement. As of last month, I have nearly 8k in my retirement account, but it constantly loses value, it's a target date 2060 fund ( FDKLX).   


Outside of the 15% contribution of my salary, I've started putting roughly 1k out of my 3080 net home pay per month (I only get 12 paychecks a year), towards an index fund that tracks the S &amp; P 500 (SWPPX) and I've been able to do this 2 months in a row, to about 2k.   


I've got a home valued at $123,000 (yes, that's the actual taxed value) with a $41,300 mortgage on it with a payoff in 2039. I've got a $13,100 personal loan that is paid off in 2028. I've also got 4k in credit card debt. No student loans or car loans. The minimums for all debt is about 850 a month.  


the 13,100 personal loan was for home repairs (new roof, foundation fixing, new HVAC system, replacing extensive water damage in bathroom and utility room resulting in a complete gutting). It was used in combination with my credit card and personal savings.   


I still need to replace the sewer line (roughly 6k), replace the garage roof (unknown estimate at this time), and get electrical up to code (roughly 5k) in the next 5-7 years.   


I am relatively healthy and I do my own car work and I drive a 21 year old car (almost 22), taxes are dirt cheap (like 20 bucks a year cheap), and insurance is also cheap for it. When this car fails, I will buy another older car and work on it. I've been using this car for about 4 years and put in about 3k to get it working/street legal to drive.  


I have a long term partner who lives with me and earns about 31k a year. They contribute about $350 a month towards utilities and pitch in sometimes for food. They spend much more than me on debt compared to income/assets:  
4k in medical debt, roughly 11k in student loan debt.  


The average income per capita in my area is only about 35k and household is around 50k average and my household earns about $87,000 with a total household debt of about $73,400.  


1: I have a bachelor's degree and have completed 4/10 classes for my master's. My bachelor's was in social sciences and my master's is going to be in cybersecurity. I currently work in I.T. involving project management, database admin, and dev work in higher education. I take about 1-2 classes a year, then a break. This is to avoid student debt.   


Should I rush this more? I can tackle the subject very well (I have a 4.0), but each class is about 2.5k.  


2: My target date retirement fund is always losing money. I try not to look at day to day performance of an fund, but I am getting antsy with this. I know the idea is that riskier investments earlier in the fund pay off later towards 2060, but I don't know to gauge the performance.  


3: Roughly 1/3rd of my net income goes to investing, 1/3rd to paying debt, the remainder is split between cost of living (food, gas, bills) and savings (usually to put into the house).   


Is this acceptable? So far it it has worked with me. There was a period of time (2020 to mid 2022) where I was putting nearly all my income towards the house. Thankfully it's safer now.  


4: I'd like to retire in my 50s, does this seem possible?  


5: I'd like to possible get a 2nd stream of income, but I don't want to make my life miserable. I've been looking into doing work for a cyber tech startup, but it's a demanding field. A lot of higher paying jobs want me to have certificates that I struggle or earn, or more experience (I've only got a year of exp in this field). Startups are more likely to take me in, but are riskier and pay less (usually they offer to pay in shares of the company).",Am I going to be fine with early retirement?

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

Which path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?

Forgive me as I may have forgotten some detail, but the story went something like this: girlfriend put $10k to cover the down payment/closing costs of the home. The two of them agreed to split that evenly down the road (at the time, the boyfriend did not have enough to cover his half). As time goes, the boyfriend made purchases towards major appliances for the home, totaling $X.

2779,1,"Hi all,

New person to Reddit here after some help…

27(M) with a child living in England in a 2 bed house at current. 

After spending my earlier years not understand or caring to understand money, racking up lots of credit card &amp; loan debts and some remortgaged. I’ve got myself into a much better financial situation. Heading into 2023 with a clean slate with no debt apart from mortgage &amp; sub accounts although some of that was debt. 

Reading ‘how to own the world’ by Andrew Craig was a great insight and awakening for how little I knew how about the game of money. 

So….

SET UP - 

Income after tax/NI  - £2500
Average income with overtime after tax/NI- £2800

Bills - 
£1250-1500 (depending on 4/5week month)

Mortgage (37 years 5 months) -
Sub account 1 - £91,923.93 @ 2.44%
Sub account 2 - £14,357.85 @ 2.44%
Sub account 3 - £14,625.92 @ 2.44%
Sub account 4 - £17,284.69 @ 2.69 % 

Planned to overpay mortgage by £100pm starting off with sub account 4. I did think about putting this into a savings account with higher interest but with the interest calculated daily I assume it’s better off to pay it direct?

Newbie to being an employee in the US, trying to set things straight for 2023. Two questions about optimally contributing to Traditional IRAs (not roth!)  


1. Is my understanding correct that for trad IRAs, I technically contribute after-tax money (whatever money has already landed in my bank account), BUT come tax day April 18, I have the option to say ""I contributed $6000 so please remove it from my taxable income for 2022"", essentially ***retroactively making it pre-tax money***?  

2. Because I just set this up, I will contribute for 2022 ($6000) and for 2023 ($6500 as a new max).  Is my understanding correct that a correct course of action should be: 
   1. Put in $12.5k now if I can
   2. claim 2022 $6k contribution/exemption on April 18, 23
   3. do nothing for a year

2786,1,"Before people  say 6 months worth of emergency expenses, because I understand that is the general rule, I'm asking as a way to maximize my savings and am looking for another viewpoint or perspective as I'm not always right. Below is my background. This is going to be long and if you do read to the end, I appreciate that. I'm a 26 year old whose parents were excellent at budgeting and saving but not so much at making their money work for them, which is something I am trying to learn more about.  I am also married but my husband and I keep our finances separate as we have different views and emotions regarding money. 

I currently making $4,400 take home from the Navy and just got a part time job that will pay anywhere from $500-800/month take home. I have zero intention of spending the extra money from the part time job and it will all go to a HYSA. 

I currently have $12,000 in my savings account that accrues about $9/month. Not a lot of money but it's something. I am expecting to get a payment of $17,00 this year in July which plays into factor for some of my options. The $17,000 is not a re-enlistment bonus, it's funds from college fund that will be paid to me once I finish my Bachelor's degree so I don't think I will be taxed on it, but I could be wrong. 

I think it's also worth noting that I have a car payment of 500/month; I pay an extra $200/month on it to pay down the principal(4.49% interest). 35% of my loan is paid off, I currently owe $19,000 and I am hoping to get it under $10,000  by the end of this year. My monthly expenses for the mortgage, utilizes, and pet care totals $1,200 a month as well. I save $300/month but that number should go up with the new side job. 

I leave myself about $1,600-$1,800/month for gas, groceries, gifts, pets, normal daily expenses.

I also keep a sinking funds, right now I am at $1,000 and my goal is to have $2,500 in it before July. Lastly, because I'm trying to cover bases on where my money goes, I put $200 into the stock market every month and $150 into my TSP, which I never see but I added it so people don't think I'm choosing to overlook retirement in its entirety.

I am looking into opening a CD with Navy Fed as it earns 4.30% APY. The only downside is the money will be locked in for a year. I am also considering opening a HYSA with American Express(3.30% APY). I currently have two credit cards with them and think they have great customer service. I have made a pay chart with showing my options in terms of amount for each based on what I put into it, as well as the interest accrued within a year. Also, if I did the calculations wrong feel free to correct them in the comments. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for advice on a lot of things, I will summarize them because I know this was long. If you read this far, I really appreciate it. I know a lot of you have more knowledge and experience in this. I can't ask my parents, their strength lies in their budgeting skills and I have gotten a lot of help on budgeting from them. 

1. How much money should I actually keep on hand? I get paid regardless of what happens to me so the six month rule does not seem the best ""fit"" for me right now. 
2. Should I put more money in my CD? I am pretty risk averse and feel comfortable putting $5,000-$7,000 in a certificate. However, I feel a little more comfortable with the money I'll be getting this year between my college fund and side job funds. 
3. Not a question but if anyone has any HYSA's they'd like to recommend, I am open to it and feel free to leave them in the comments
4. Am I spending too much a month? I know that is a lot for people but I enjoy eating out and buying things for my pets. It makes me happy and I don't feel I'm going broke because of it. 
5. If you feel comfortable answering, what would you do in this situation?

I really need your help. 

I took out a loan back in 2019 and paid it off by the scheduled time in 2020. I never missed a payment and received a letter saying my balance for the loan was at £0 meaning I had nothing left to pay off. 

COVID completely destroyed my family. My dad was incredibly vulnerable due to a whole list of health problems and legally needed 24 hour care so we we went into our own personal bubble from March 2020 until 2022. Unfortunately he had to be hospitalised in April 2022 and whilst in the hospital caught COVID, which killed him. 

Me and my mum were his full time carers over the 2 years of COVID so as you can imagine things have been pretty rough. I had no need to check my credit score until late 2022 where I found out that I’d apparently not paid off the loan and had an outstanding amount which was unpaid for TWO YEARS. 

My credit score is ruined. It was really good before this as I’d taken out loans to build it up and always paid them off. I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to finances and I haven’t found the courage to ring them yet.  

Is this something they can fix? I looked back on my bank statements and there was one month where the payment was reversed due to my bank account not having the funds, but I knew that at the time so immediately put the funds into the account and then it was taken afterwards.

The biggest thing for me is I received the letter confirming it was paid off, and have had no correspondence to say otherwise since.

I know I need to ring them but I’d love to hear what you think the outcome is going to be, so I don’t walk into that phone call with my hopes up and get crushed. I’m going to university this year and I’m worried I won’t be able to get accommodation with how bad my credit score is now, if any landlords require a credit check.

First off, many sources discussing Massachusetts suggest that ‘Marital property refers to all property, rights, and assets acquired during the course of the marriage, regardless of which spouse actually acquired them. ‘

That means any income earned and property acquired is owned by whichever spouse’s name is on the check or property title.’

Nonetheless, when I talked with my boss, we agreed that I made well below the standard tax deduction threshold for a single person in 2022: $12,950. So, he doesn't intend to issue me a W-2. Besides, he never issued one to any of his previous part-time personal assistants.

I will describe what I did and do at the moment. So that you have an understanding of the situation.  

I have been saving money since 2008. For my purposes. I wanted to go to study in Japan. Passed the JLPT (Japanese-Language Proficiency Test). In 2014, I almost raised the necessary amount. But then the ruble collapsed. ( Crimea ). 

I took this into account later. I began to buy dollars and save them on a paypal account.  In 2022, I wanted to finish my job as an animation teacher. And go to Japan. But... Hell has begun. I lost money on stocks, I lost money on paypal. He does not work in Russia. 

I was completely broken. But thanks to my students. Looking at them, I came out of depression.

I currently work three jobs:

1. Teaching children animation and comics (200 $/m)
2.  I work for a TV company as a video editor (100$/m)
3. In the morning I work as a janitor (50 $/m)

With the help of friends in Ukraine and Moldova, I open a new store with prints. Before all this hell, he brought me 15-300 $/m. I hope to get at least half of it. 

Monetization on YouTube has been disabled. Before that, it brought 30-150 $/m.

Students from abroad cannot study with me now. Before all this, 200-500 $/m.

The roadmap looks something like this:

1. Restore what I can.
2. Move to a visa-free country.
3. Try to access my paypal.
4. Moving to Japan.

In her other job, she hasn’t been checking her paystubs in a while (between 2 jobs and us starting our own business she just never got around to it) and yesterday looked at one.

What she found was that, without her knowledge, she was signed up for the companies 401k program, and they’ve been taking money for it for several months.

Her employer doesn’t have an explanation, other than that she should have been receiving emails about it. We searched, but found no emails regarding the 401k.

She is a little over $3000 over the yearly limit because of this, and the employer says it will cost us $195 to get the money back.

My opinion is that as she never signed up for it (the employer thinks the person entering her information when she started accidentally entered it) that she should be able to get the money back without paying anything.

To be clear, the employer has admitted that she never signed up for it. They feel she should have noticed it earlier, and I’m guessing that this is why they want her to pay the $195. However, that’s a standard amount, regardless of how much was contributed, so the $195 would be the same charge even if she noticed it the first time.

I have been looking for this answer, but can't seem to find it, so I hope someone is able to help...

If I have a 13-week treasury bill (held at treasurydirect.gov) that is maturing on 4/6/2023 and I want to convert that bill to a 26-week treasury bill after maturity, how do I go about doing this on treasurydirect.gov?

Is it possible to place a buy/bid on the 4/3/2023 auction date and then depend on the cash being available from the matured t-bill on the 6/4/2023 settlement/maturity date?

If not, does that mean the cash from the matured t-bill has to sit for a week before I can use it to buy the new 26-week t-bill at the following weeks auction?

If it is possible to buy the new 26-week t-bill in the same week as the old 13-week t-bill matures, do I have to make sure that the ""Maturity Payment Destination"" is ""Zero-Percent C of I"" and not a bank account?  Would I then also have to make sure the order for the 26-week t-bill has ""Zero-Percent C of I"" as the ""Source of funds""?  Any other thing I have to do to make sure it works?

Wanted to start saving and investing and being fiscally responsible since I’m now 26 in a government job that pays me 85k and I’m weeks away from getting a raise to about 120k. I need to stop my “fuck it” attitude when it comes to finances. I max out my TSP to meet the now 22,500 limit. Have less than 3k in cc debt. Wife and I split mortgage where we each pay 1250 a month. Wife makes 135k.  No car payment, $30 phone bill a month, $55 car insurance bill a month. Also internet bill. 

Almost all my money goes to going out drinking and eating with wife and friends because we’re young and enjoy it while we can do it. A few purchases too like clothes and house stuff etc. I should say that I went from making 50k a year to 85k a year back in September. And only started making 50k back in March of 2021. This is all very new to me but I want to be responsible now instead of later when I have kids.

My apologies if this doesn't fit here, but I'm looking for advice. 

I was just relocated two states over and start my new position on Tuesday. Due to circumstances out of my control, I was only able to move into my new apartment on Dec 31.  My new lease started on Dec 30. 

I called the leasing office and they confirmed they'd be open from 10 - 5 on Dec 31. They are to be closed till Jan 3.  An email was sent out to all residents confirming these holiday hours. 

I drove eight hours and arrived before 2pm. The office was closed, without a note or anything. I witnessed several residents approach the door only to see they were closed. No one answered my calls. 

I was forced to get a hotel and it seems like I'll be here for a few days. It's not cheap. 

How should I approach this once they open? I doubt they'll pay, but I'm a bit lost on how to proceed.",Can't move into apartment for three days. Leasing office stood me up. Have to pay for hotel stay.

2876,1,"I really need some advice on taking over my parent's mortgage for a while. Currently they do not bring in a lot of income and since I have a stable one, I have decided to take over their mortgage to help them out. However, there are a lot of moving parts and I saw some ""disturbing"" things with their mortgage. 

They owe about \~200k in principal, but so far this year, only \~4k of that balance is paid off and instead 7.3k on interest and 8.5k on taxes. So it seems like they are barely touching their balance. In fact, they took out a loan of 216k back in 2006 and their current principal is still 200k. I'm wondering if this is even worth paying off or we should just sell the house and move into a smaller home where the finance is much more reasonable, manageable, and doable. I would love for them to not worry about debt since they're old.

They (now I) pay 1.6k/month and the breakdown is, they pay 300 in principal, 550 on interest and 750 on escrow. Did they get screwed over on this loan? What can I do to better their financial situation when it comes to this home? And lastly, what are the tax implications for me taking over my parent's mortgage? I know technically it's a gift, but is there anything else involved?

Kindly thanks as I am totally lost on all this, but I would love to support them to help them out financially. Obviously, I would rather have them live here than be homeless, but I don't want to make a huge financial error and just throw money down the drain.",Parent's mortgage confusion
2877,1,"I work in IT as a lead desktop support role making 80k a year. I work fully remote 100%. I love it. The savings in fuel and mileage on my car is really nice, plus all the time back to myself. I pretty much get 3 hours back every single day. I’m also able to do small chores and tasks around the house during slow parts of the day and it’s just really nice. 

The company I work for is great, and I would love to stay, but like everything else I do keep my options open. Whether I end up obtaining more certifications or go into a manager role, I keep my resume updated and usually every so often I’ll peek some job boards and check out postings. I’ve noticed a lot of remote work has started to dry up as places are opening up offices again. 

My question is how much more income do you think I should aim for to justify commuting again? I live in a medium-high COL area (Not CA/NY but not the Midwest either). And I’m a part of urban sprawl. I live about 20 miles away minimum from various business suites where work typically is, so I would be looking at a 40 mile round trip each day at the very minimum. Back pre-pandemic I of course commuted every single day..about 1 hour each way, dealing with rush hour traffic, having to wake up extra early to get ready. 

I guess I’m not opposed to it if the price is right, I think everything has a price, but right now I’m super fortunate to literally wake up even just 20 minutes before work if I want to and turn on my computer to start my day. I get way more sleep, I’m stressed way less, and I get so much more time to myself. 

What would be your income to justify commuting again? This is all hypothetical.",How much of a income increase would it take to justify commuting again?

Anyway, I have a bunch credit card debt that's slowly been racking up over the years. Last year I wanted to get serious about paying it off so I applied for a Happy Money consolidation loan. I'm a big stupid moron so I only put about half of my debt (the cards with the highest interest rate) on it to ""try it"", not realizing that you can't add to this loan later. I love Happy Money and I wish I'd just put all of my debt on that at once. Boo.

Now I basically have this massive Happy Money account and then 3 other smaller credit cards, all totaling about $27k. About two months ago I learned about Accredited  Debt Relief and I was like ""oh that sounds cool"". I did a bit of research and they have good reviews, so I thought why not. All of my credit cards and the Happy Money loan qualified, so I thought this would be a good option.

The first thing they tell you to do is stop paying your credit card/loan bills, so I've done that. This is where I'm kinda getting cold feet. I really hate not paying my bills and watching my credit score drop. I've been getting calls and letters and it stresses me out. I've heard that the best thing to do is just trust the program but I'm still nervous.

I've also recently received a letter from Best Egg in the main for a pre-approved personal loan at 8.99% APR that would cover up to $50k. So...should I abandon ship with Accredited Debt Relief, get this other loan, and pay off all my stuff with this?!?! Or at least pull out 3/4 of the qualifying cards/loans from A.D.R. (one of the loans looks like it might reach a settlement soon). Previously I was having trouble getting approved for another debt consolidation loan because I'd applied for the Happy Money one too recently...I'm just nervous and in over my head and I feel like I'm making a bad situation worse lol.

My employer doesn't have a 401k plan (that I've been told of, I'll ask her tomorrow), so I heard it's best in that case to open an IRA account. Is that true? And if so, my bank (Regions) has investing options as well, could I use my bank? Is it better to use my bank or something like Betterment?

Now, I don't bring a lot of money in monthly. Most of it goes to bills, and paying my car monthly, and helping my family out, so I didn't want to put in a lot but just little by little to get me started.

2926,1,"So, there are three parties involved in this situation:

1. My husband, the employee
2. Mr. Blank's Business, Inc., my husband's employer (which pays him a biweekly paycheck)
3. Mrs. Someone's LLC, which has a contract with Mr. Blank's Business for the completion of a project and pays Blank's business directly for time, materials, etc.

Mrs. Someone gave us a check as a Christmas gift, but that check is not from her personal bank account, it's from her LLC's bank account.

Since Mrs. Someone's LLC isn't my husband's employer, but my husband's employer's employer, is that check considered a gift (and therefore not taxable income, at least not for the recipient) or a bonus (and thus considered taxable income)?

This is especially important to us as we've received the APTC subsidy for our monthly health insurance premiums this year and this check would put us above our estimated income for 2022, therefore requiring us to make repayments.

From what I've gleaned from internet research, gift tax is payed by the gift giver unless the gift recipient agrees to pay it instead, and neither party have to pay it unless it equals or exceeds the amount of the annual gift tax exclusion ($16000 in 2022), which in this case it does not.

Am I right in concluding that this counts as a gift, not income, despite being given by a business?

Does  the capital gains tax rate work like income tax - you pay a given rate  for all income within each rate threshold - OR is it the case that as  soon as your income crosses the earning threshold, you pay capital gains  taxes on *all* of your capital gains (even those below the income threshold for that rate)?

Here's an example to clarify:

In  2022, the capital gains tax rate is 0% until a single filer earns  $41,676 at which point is shifts to a 15% capital gains tax rate. Let's  say I earn $40,000, and I have capital gains of $2,000. Would I have to  pay the 15% capital gains tax on *all $2000*  of my capital gains, or would I pay 0% on $1,676 of my capital gains,  and only pay 15% on the $324 in capital gains that pushes me over the  $41676 income threshold?

My partner and I are fortunate to have a good, steady income and are currently maxing out our tax-protected retirement accounts.  Both of us were also lucky enough to graduate college without any significant debt (one of us did four years at a private college, the other did 2 years private/2 years public) thanks to parental support.  On one hand, we want to give our children the same opportunities but on the other hand, looking at projected costs it's hard to fathom that a private school is providing adequate value for the cost difference.

I've put together a projection in excel to help us plan for our 529.  If our kids follow the standard timeline (i.e. no gap years), they'd be entering school in Fall of '29 and Fall of '31.  

By my projections the future value for four years of private school would be around $440K (1st child) and $465K (2nd child) while public school would be around $160K/$170K.  If we were to fully fund each child's 529 to plan for private school and they attended public school instead, each of the 529s would be left with over $325K after graduation.

Obviously there are options for that leftover money including graduate school, rolling it over into their own children's (or other relative's) 529s, and now rolling it into Roth's, but on the other hand, $650K is a significant chunk of change to wrap up in an account where non-qualified withdrawals are penalized.

They had no savings and were both reliant on social security as their sole income. With his passing, she now only makes about $950 from social security each month.

She drains her bank account to zero whenever the social security payment hits each month and barely squeaks by. For Christmas, she decided to buy us and several family members gifts from the Montgomery Ward catalog using their credit. My mother in law is a very nice woman, but I guarantee she was lured in with a “Buy Now, Pay Later” scheme without thinking through the details of interest rates, etc.

Since we manage her finances, we asked to see the bill so we could get it paid for her and balance her monthly budget. She charged nearly 500 dollars to this credit account. She also did not hand over the info until we asked and she already missed this month’s payment due date. Apparently they want her to pay 25 a month plus 25.99% interest for the next 17 months or so. Honestly, her budget is down to zero each month- she cannot even afford the 25 a month.

In total, I am spending a little less than I am making including everything. The extra money either goes into an emergency fund or small leisure activities.

Recently, I had a large salary increase to ~$136k gross/year and I contribute about 7% to my pre-tax account, 5% to my Roth account and I get 100% employer match at 3% which is about 15% total contributions. I understand the concept of *why* one should/shouldn‘t contribute to a Roth 401k, but I wanted to explain my understanding and get your advice. After running the numbers, I realized that, with inflation and continuing on my current path, my withdrawals in retirement would be in the same tax bracket that I am currently in (24%). Obviously if I continue on my current trajectory of increasing my salary until retirement, at some point I will be in a higher tax bracket than when I will withdrawal and at that point I should decrease the amount I put into my Roth 401k and put that into my pre-tax 401k, right? But what I’m wondering is if I should I do this already in 2023? In addition to that, I should be doing the backdoor Roth IRA method with the smaller amount I will continue to contribute to my Roth 401k, right?

2954,1,"Hi all! Apologies if this isn't quite the right sub but I figure a lot of people on here have opinions. I am a longtime Mac Quicken user getting restless for other options. When they did the total rewrite of the app some years back, it lost a lot of the graphing and reporting features that I enjoyed using. Quicken on the web/iOS has even fewer reporting features, making it essentially useless to me. 

I essentially use Quicken as a ledger for all my accounts and a means to get reports on how I'm spending my money. I don't really need advanced tax or budgeting features (I have an Excel spreadsheet for this), and I don't really care about syncing accounts with bank websites (I prefer to enter transactions manually, I ""trust"" that process more) but I would like an application that lets me sync data between multiple Macs/iPads/iPhones and produce pretty graphs of how much I'm spending where, income vs. expenses, reports on the performance of my relatively simple investments, that sort of thing. I would also want something that could import data from Quicken, where I have years worth of info I don't want to lose.  MoneyWiz and Banktivity look interesting and I'd love to hear from people who use them but I'm open to other suggestions.

Thought I would live there quite a while, but had an unexpected job opportunity so I moved and now I rent (for a federal civil service job), and I have a renter in the condo and make about $250/month profit from the rental price. I think the condo may now be worth something like $200K, based on recent sales in the complex, and I have $150K to go on the mortgage.

I love my new city and like the job, and I hope to stay in federal service in this area for sure. I daydream regularly about owning instead of renting my primary residence, but I am wondering what I ought to know about trying to purchase a second condo in new city without changing the arrangement of the old condo (renter likes it, I like keeping it as an investment). I would be looking for about the $300-350K range.

2956,1,"Hi! I'm 29, m and currently work in tech. Up till now, I've sort of juggled my career with moving around the world. I've lived in 5 different cities in my 20's, in and out of the country, some where I had a job, some where I didn't.

I've been pretty thoughtful up till now with my finances--I constantly invest in my 401k, roth IRA, etc. when I'm employed (which is the majority of the time) and have also continued to build my career. Now that I'm almost 30, I'm thinking about this next decade. My parents have made it seem like your 30's are the time you need to ""settle down somewhere long-term"" for financial stability.

It saddens me a bit, because there are so many places I want to try living still. At this point, I feel like I'm financially solid--I'm well on my way to building out my retirement and foundation--but I'm definitely not as affluent as I could be if I just stayed in one place and worked constantly. 

I think I want to continue with my lifestyle of trying different places, but just want to confirm that there's no incredibly important reason why I need to settle in one place in my 30's. I don't want to struggle later in life or be living paycheck to paycheck, so if there's something I *need* to do or focus on in my 30's to avoid that, I'll do it.

I read about the various rules of thumb when it comes to house budgets, but I'm hoping you guys can tell me how much of that applies more specifically to my situation. Relevant info:

* Mid 20s, single w/ no dependents

* 120k salary (technically also have 12k bonus and 100k in RSUs vesting over next 4 years, but I haven't been at this company long enough to know how consistently this bonus will pay out in full, and the stock has historically not been a very strong performer so it could be next to nothing by the time it actually vests. Thus I'm not comfortable counting them when budgeting).

* I take home 2.5k biweekly after maxing 401k and HSA contributions.

* No major debts except monthly CC statement, which is generally somewhere between $1k-1.5k each month.

* Current rent is $2k and that's pretty comfortable I feel. I think I could realistically pay more like 2.5k for housing. Maaaaybe 3k? (but that might involve cutting down savings being put into markets, let me know if this is a terrible idea)

* Currently have about 100k in index funds, adding 1k biweekly so hoping it will be larger than that when it comes time to buy.

Last year I was employed in two remote roles, one was super chill so I picked up the second job. The second contract just ended so Ill be employed in one role to start the year and will probably pick up another in the next few months.

My current role pays 45/hour, W2 no benefits. I am planning on maxing an IRA at $6,500.  Won’t have any 401k match and I think I don’t even have access to contribute to a 401k because my employer doesn’t offer one.  I will live on this salary and when I pick up a second job I’ll bank all of that.

2971,1,"I'm new to investing, I've been doing so for roughly half a year. My goal is to invest in stocks that pay dividends and continuously re-invest those dividends back into more shares over the roughly 30 stocks I have shares in. I've created a strategy which I believe will let me increase my dividends slightly faster but I'd like to share here and confirm.

Every 2 weeks, I make my investments, combining a fixed amount from my paycheck with whatever dividends I've received in the previous 2 weeks. My strategy is to heavily favor buying shares in stocks where the ex-date will occur within the next 2 weeks. My reasoning is that I will see a slight return from that investment pretty soon in the form of dividends paid out by that stock within the next month or so. As I keep doing this, I'll be compounding dividends faster.

I believe this is valid because of this thought experiment: let's say I have 4 stocks which pay once per year. Each stock pays dividends in a different quarter: stock A for Q1 up to stock D for Q4. Each pays 4% dividend. I'll have $100 each quarter to invest.

* If I invest $100 in each quarter all into stock D, I'll have $400 in stock D and have a total value of $416.
* If I invest $100 in each stock at each quarter, I'll have:
   * $100 in A, which yields $4
   * $104 in B, which yields $4.16
   * $108.16 in C, which yields $4.3264 (I'm not sure how the rounding would actually work but here I'll use fractional cents)
   * $112.4864 in D, which yields $4.499456
   * At the end, I'll have a total value of $100 + $104 + $108.16 + $112.4864 + $4.499456 = $429.15

Anyway, I've never done anything like ths before, and I'm afraid I'll screw up my finances.  I'd appreciate help/advice in making sure I have all my bases covered. 

I already have health coverage from my pension, so I don't need to worry about that. I also have professional liability insurance.

To start, my rates are $85/hour and so far both jobs are 7 hour days - so that's $595 per day, $2380 per week.  I think I need to save about 30% for taxes, right?  So that's saving about $715 and banking about $1665 per week?

Can I claimm the laptop I bought this year if I am using it for work? (In the fall I contracted just one day per week at a school district and bought the laptop to use there.)

Finally, for taxes, is it based on when you did the work, or when you got the money?  Example:  I worked in December for $3600, but won't get paid for that until January.  That still goes on this year's taxes, right?

I also now have to consider that I only get paid on days that I work, so holidays and sick days will affect my paycheck.  I feel like I should set up my own PTO fund so that I don't panic if there's a snow day or if I'm sick.  How do I determine what is an appropriate amount - based off my last job it seems like $550/month is reasonable?

Should I open separate checking/savings accounts to deposit my paychecks in and buy materials/supplies from and then basically pay myself from those accounts, or is it fine to just use my existing personal accounts for everything?

2984,1,"So I’m currently 17 years old, and I was recently accepted into a university early decision. I looked onto my college’s website, and I found out that my tuition will be about $80k a year (including housing + meals), and I assume my family will spend money to bring me home when school is out. I had several conversations with my mother about how exactly I will pay for school, and she said that the majority of my tuition will be payed through a trust fund that my father left me before he passed away.
For most of my life, I chose not to ask my mother about the trust because I always heard her complain about how the long court battle she had trying to uphold the clause of her divorce agreement saying that if either she or my dad were to pass away before I was 18, they would leave all their money to me, but my father instead tried to leave *some* money to his friends and establish his lawyer friend as my trustee. Apparently, the fight got pretty nasty, and even though my mother was named a trustee by a judge later on, my dad’s lawyer friend used money from my trust fund to pay for his defense in the lawsuit. My mom also objected to paying someone to manage my stocks and bonds while we have family who are very successful hedge fund workers.
After sitting down with my mom, I discovered that my trust fund is currently worth about $1.4 million in various stocks and bonds. The fund was set up about 3-4 years ago at around $1.1 million, and it has paid my $40-45k tuition at private school since then, and I guess it makes sense that its still gaining money if the annual return for this year was about 5.3% or $72k. I did see that the fund was worth about $1.8 million a year ago, but my hedge fund friend explained that some stocks have gone down in the past year, and they will for a bit in the future. The fund, however, is still where it was 2 years ago, and that’s after my mom took out $150-$200k to pay for expenses.
My real question is what should I expect the next “changes” to my trust to look like, because even though my mother told me it will dissolve and ownership will be mine at around age 23, the trust was set up entirely for EDUCATION. Based on the way my mom talked about it, she didn’t expect me to have much of anything left by the time I finish college (and possibly grad school) since my trust has fluctuated a bit. I still thought that if I can generate $72k a year from the trust, and combine it with the $30-40k from my Mom’s 529, I wouldn’t see much of a change compared to now, and I could have $1 million by the time I’m 23.

I need your advice on how to invest or use my savings money in order to further increase and gain more money. I currently have $30K which I absolutely do not need, and wanted some advice on the best course of action to take with it.

2988,1,"Hello PF,

I'm looking for guidance on how to allocate funds, as I will be fully funding my Roth IRA next week. I currently have a Roth IRA and a brokerage account through Charles Schwab. My current Roth balance is at $85,000 and is pretty evenly distributed between SCHD, SCHK, BUFBX, and OAKBX. These were funds recommended to me by Schwab associates over the years. I'm planning on funding $6,500 into the Roth next week and was wondering if I should divide that evenly between the funds I already have, pick a new fund to invest in, or dump the $6,500 into a specific fund I already have in the Roth. 

In my Schwab brokerage account I have $127,000 divided between APLE (Apple Hospitality REIT), PONAX, and SWOBX. The allocation to APLE is quite large and  I receive dividends each month that I use to fund my Roth for the next year.

Additionally, I have a brokerage with Vanguard and am holding VWENX totaling $46,000. I also have a pension and a 401a and 457, totaling $30,000 through my job with the city.

2991,1,"Over the last year, I have paid off 85% of my CC debt, freeing up some of my income to pay debts/save. I am conflicted whether it makes more sense for me to aggressively pay down my private student loan, to save aggressively, or to do a 50/50 split of my discretionary income. 

**Currently own about 50k in student loans, divided below as such:**

* **Private Student loan with credit union** \- \~**$9,100 at 3.02%** \- min monthly payment **$225.** 5 year loan, paid off in Aug 2026 if paying on minimum. 
* **Federal loans** \- **$41,599.00** \- weighted average interest rate: **4.21%,** no monthly payments as currently frozen. Eligible for 20k forgiveness if it goes through, but I am not hoping on it. Once payment resumes next summer, I estimate my payment to be around $150/month with the new IPR plans. 

My remaining CC debt totaling about **$3k** on an AMEX card. Will have it paid off before the intro APR expires in April. 

I am currently making **$4400/month** after taxes (including health/vision/dental premiums, and contributing 3% to my company offered 401k plan.). I live in a HCOL. 

Within the next year, I am expecting a pay raise of $10-15k/year, with high probably of reaching $120k+/year in the next 5-7 years. I work in a field that is very minimally affected by a potential recession. 

**Current savings: $2,000**

**Retirement - 401k balance is \~$7,000.** I am 26 for reference on how close I am to retirement. 

My company matches 50% of the first 8% of pay contributed, which is vested after 3 years of service. Currently have slight a year of working at my current company. 

Total combined 401k balance is **\~$7,000.** I am 26 for reference how close I am to retirement. 

**Monthly expenses (minimums): $2,171**

* No rent/housing expenses as I live at home, but I pay the electric bill as an agreement - **\~$300**(taking the average through the year)
* Student loan minimum - $**225**
* Other debt minimums (including car, CCs, and installment plans) - $**1041** (lowering to $800 by March 2023)
* Other expenses(phone, car insurance, etc): $**605**

Did not include things like groceries, gas, and other misc. expenses in this, as it is easier to reduce how much I am spending and there are no minimums.

2993,1,"I would like some help with how I should invest and save my money to reach the goals I have. First car then apartment/house. I don’t care what type of car I drive as long as it’s safe and reliable long term. 

I would like to become a home owner by 30-31 but fine renting first if needed. Housing seems to get worst every year so idek know if I’ll be able to own a home unless it’s with a future partner. I won’t be having kids (lots of reasons behind that) but that should help a lot financially long term. 

Anyways some background:

-I currently have around $6,600 in my checking account. (Used to have more sitting there for longer and I still have no savings account haha but that’s another story) I would like to invest it somewhere. Index funds I heard are good, but if there’s other low risk/manageable places that would be good. 

-Credit score is 706 and recently got a credit card to start building more credit. (Good student loan history helped my credit I think)

-I was working recently when I was away from home for awhile but due to bad budgeting/spending I spent all the money I made and more. Also no 401K currently. 

-I have no car (this will be my first purchase to work towards)

-I have no job but I’m looking for a part/full time wfh job; if I’m able to get one soon it should bring in around 23-29k before taxes. (Parent’s schedule makes it’s hard for me to use one of the cars for in person work) 

-Monthly expenses $100-200. (These are medical related with a couple small subscriptions thrown in also the occasional food order)

-I’m grateful to have a good relationship with my parents so I don’t pay rent, and will be on my parent’s insurance till 26 or later. (I pull my weight with chores, meals, and wherever else I’m needed)

-I’m currently in school online. I’m halfway through but won’t be starting back classes till summer/fall semester. (I’m still doing school related studies though)

-When I graduate, hopefully around 24-25, I should only have 10-15k in loans to pay back. But there’s also a chance I will graduate debt free. 

With the information given I want to know how I can start making plans to achieve these goals over time.

Home Equity: 32k (calculated as purchase price - mortgage, not counting any appreciation)

No debts besides mortgage (15 year at 2.5%)

**Random Tidbits**

* I am very thankful for the privileges that I have had. My parents helped pay for college, so I graduated with a bachelor's degree debt free.
* We paid for the last 2 years of my wife's college, taking on some student loans. We paid cash for my masters degree. 
* I am learning to be content and happy with my situation. When I take a step back, I have it made. I have a great job that pays well and I work from home. My spouse is able to stay home with our kid. I have a spacious house and so many other luxuries. 
* We've been a 1 car family since we've been married and saved a lot of money. I was lucky to be able to walk/bike/take transit for my commutes until I switched to remote. We started out with a 6k used car that my spouse had just bought, ran it to the ground and then bought a 7k car that was well maintained from a family member. 
* My spouse and I have fought a lot about finances. They grew up somewhat poor and didn't want to continue living as frugal now that they finally had money. I am naturally very frugal. We tried Mint to track stuff, didn't work well. Then we kind of stopped tracking and just tried to spend from a pot of money after bills and savings were accounted for. I like spreadsheets, my spouse never looked at them and I had a hard time giving up control. A few months ago we switched to a hybrid cash envelope system and using a money book that we track everything in. It's been great. My spouse has gotten much more involved and it feels like we are a team and can both see where the money is going and how much we have left to spend. My advice: keep trying until you find a system that works for you.
* Discovered the FIRE community around 2017 and I soaked up everything I could. I realized the boring middle can hit pretty fast. I have enjoyed all I've learned the last few years and am trying to not focus so much on finances and just live. Invest regularly what you can and simply wait for it to grow.",Journey to the first $100k

28,0,"To clarify, I ""failed"" at FIRE because I ended up going back to work almost a year after I pulled the trigger and quit. I consider myself BaristaFIRE because I'm working part-time (80% FTE) for the health insurance benefits and to reach a higher FIRE number. 

Some thoughts now that I've been BaristaFIRE for over a year now (SO remains unemployed, although staying home to care for our twin toddlers is arguably a much harder job than mine where I sit on a computer all day):

* We likely pulled the trigger too early, as we were probably still in leanFIRE territory with lots of big unknown/future expenses (still looking to buy a house, baby #3 on the way, etc) 
* Working from home for 8 hrs/day from Monday thru Thursday has been great for work-life balance, especially since I moved into a lower individual contributor role with no direct reports and hardly any meetings - I have plenty of time to eat breakfast/lunch with our kids, read to them and play with them, and help with cleanup
* With that said, I would still prefer having no job versus a part-time job - I'd like to be a fully present parent for my kids like I was during the time period before I went back to work
* Having a job/salary should hopefully make it easier to get a mortgage, rather than having to try other methods like an asset-based loan, or liquidating a large portion of my taxable brokerage to pay for a house in all cash 
* It's a huge load off my mind to have W2 income for expenses instead of drawing down from our nest egg, i.e. not having to switch from saving mode to spending mode
* Our retirement portfolio is allowed to grow since it remains untouched, which helps to fund regular/chubby FIRE and future/unknown expenses, aka I probably also suffer from One More Year syndrome
* Since I'm still at my high-paying gig, my income allows me the ability to max out my 401k/HSA/IRAs and have enough left over to cover expenses 
* Health insurance costs through my employer are relatively predictable as the premiums, deductible, and OOP Max have remained mostly the same (or with slight increases) over the years
* Our current healthcare coverage is suitable for our needs - we prefer an out-of-state health system which is unfortunately out-of-network for our state's ACA plans
* While this job is great, I know that it won't last forever, so I'm trying to enjoy it as much as I can (I have no problem saying 'no' and for the most part, I can influence my boss to steer work away from my direction, but who knows if/when they'll make a decision to force me to go full time, or my boss leaves and gets replaced by someone really bad, or a reorganization or layoff happens) 
* Before I had kids, I was super ambitious and wanted to climb the corporate ladder as quickly as possible. Now that I have kids, I'm grateful to have a really chill job, but sometimes my pre-kids mentality creeps in and I start thinking about going for those higher roles again. I'm still working through this, but my rational brain knows that now is not the time to add work to my plate, with two toddlers running around and a new baby on the way. If I'm not FIREd by the time they're all school age, then maybe that might be a more appropriate time to start seeking new positions","Failed at FIRE, now currently BaristaFIRE"

It seems like question posts are being moved out of the daily thread, so I'm posting this at top level. Let me know if this really does belong in the daily and I'll repost accordingly.

I'm considering whether to contribute to the mega backdoor Roth or, contrary to advice often cited here, send savings beyond my traditional 401K, (backdoor) Roth IRA, and HSA directly to taxable instead. I'm very early in career (age 23, have been working full time for less than a year). I'm totally blind and am pursuing FI in case some potential hearing issues later in life make me unemployable.

While my company offers the mega backdoor Roth (big tech), I imagine that at this stage, much of the value from these early contributions will come from gains rather than principle. I was considering setting up substantially equally periodical payments (SEPP) should I need to retire before age 59.5 and access this account, but this seems disadvantageous from a tax perspective (taxed on earnings and withdrawal at ordinary income rate, as opposed to long-term capital gains on withdrawal from a brokerage). Am I really better off giving up this tax-advantaged space and contributing to a regular brokerage account, assuming pre-59.5 withdrawal? Thanks!",Double taxation on the mega backdoor Roth (is it worth it in my situation?)

Okay I'm kidding about the clothes part... sort of...***

(We're a 38M / 38F dual-income household with two young kids in a VHCOL area.)

I'm the one that has always kept track of the numbers in our household, and like most in the FI community, I track our NW fairly closely, have us heavy into VTSAX/VTI, etc. My wife has always trusted me to handle our finances and has never really gotten into the weeds with me.

With thoughts and concerns of a rough 2023 swirling in my head, I recently did an analysis of our household spending in 2022, and while I knew our spending had gone up significantly over the last couple years, primarily due to a home purchase and a couple large home improvement projects, I was still taken aback at just how much our other discretionary spending had increased.

While my wife is no spendthrift (she and I have both played equal roles in letting lifestyle creep seep in over the last few years), I needed a way to catch her up and point out the ""opportunity"" before us in a non-confrontational way. Past conversations we'd had around $ hadn't gone particularly well -- I'd pull up our Personal Capital account and start walking her through various charts and graphs, all while espousing the merits of FI, and it was just information overload.

(Side note, I am a huge fan of Personal Capital as an aggregation/NW tracking tool. I've never used their advisory services so can't speak to that.)

So, in an attempt to frame our situation in a more constructive and collaborative way, and per my wife's request (believe it or not), I put some slides together to walk her through an end-of-2022 financial recap for our family. (I'm a mgmt consultant by day, so basically crank slides out for a living.) .

* Gross income: $360k
* Expenses: $110K (credit cards paid off monthly)
* Cash: $630k (600k in HYSA earning 3-4%. 30k in checking). We plan to put $500K as a down payment on the house. The remainder will be an E-fund.

If I set my range from 900k-1.1M, I'm looking at a monthly payment of 4k-5k. If both of us keep working, that is tenable. However, if one of us stays home when we have kids, our income gets cut in half, and our housing costs become 33% of our gross income. That's at the very top of the recommended range and makes me feel nervous.

The other factor is I have no idea how to budget for increased child expenses.

80,0," A recession is a period of economic downturn, typically defined as a decline in GDP (gross domestic product) for two or more consecutive quarters. During a recession, businesses may experience decreased demand for their products or services, leading to layoffs, reduced profits, and other financial challenges. Consumers may also feel the impact of a recession through reduced income, increased unemployment, and a general sense of economic uncertainty. While recessions can be difficult for individuals and organizations, they are a normal part of the economic cycle and are often followed by periods of growth and expansion. 

How to prepare for recession?

 

There are several steps that individuals and organizations can take to prepare for a recession:

1. Build up an emergency fund: Having a financial cushion can help you weather financial setbacks and unexpected expenses. Aim to save enough to cover at least three to six months of living expenses.
2. Reduce debt: Paying off high-interest debt and limiting new borrowing can make you more financially resilient and better able to weather a recession.
3. Diversify your investments: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified investment portfolio can help mitigate the impact of market downturns.
4. Review your budget: Take a close look at your spending and see where you can cut back. Identifying areas where you can reduce expenses can give you more flexibility if your income is reduced during a recession.
5. Consider building up your skills: During a recession, it may be harder to find a job or get a raise. Consider taking a course or getting additional training to make yourself more marketable and increase your earning potential.
6. Stay informed: Keep an eye on economic indicators and stay informed about potential risks. This can help you make informed decisions about your finances.
7. Seek help if you need it: Don't be afraid to reach out for help if you are struggling financially. There may be resources available to assist you, such as unemployment benefits, financial assistance programs, or counseling services.",How To Stay Financially Fit During A Recession - BICHEP
81,0,"Here's a twist on the age old debate to keep a cheap mortgage or pay it down...

Seeking some community perspective on the Ministerial Housing Allowance--MHA--if any of you know about it...This is for a family member. I'm using a throwaway to not make sure they're not identifiable.

Their net worth is a hair over 1M. Two incomes, just under 200K or so total. Maxing 401Ks, RIRAs, 529s for state tax deduction, plus some additional savings in brokerage, totalling maybe 80-95K, so about 40-50% savings rate. So they consider themselves near FI, sort of LeanFI now. They don't anticipate retiring for at least four years, and they could imagine working as many as 10 more years. They are in their mid-40s.

Lots of current spend is giving and temporary expenses and large discretionary spending. Their essential spending is maybe 36K, including home insurance and taxes (5900/yr total), but NOT including Principal and Interest.

So here's the deal. The mortgage P&amp;I is 1400/mo (16,800/yr). Rate is 2.5% on 30 years. Refi was Oct 2020, when home appraisal was 460K. They've already paid off some extra, so current balance is 306K, and if they just pay minimums, they pay it off in mid-2046 (4.5 years early).

They have access to the MHA. (I'm not looking for a discussion of this element of the tax code, of course. I'm just looking to help this family member.)

So they could write off up to about 71K/yr in housing expenses (due to the fair market value of their home rented in their market if fully furnished). So that's the 5900 for taxes and insurance and the 16800 for P&amp;I, so 22700.

And then they could write off additional principal paydown up to about 48K/yr. They are in the 22% bracket, so the additional tax savings would be about 10K. A guaranteed 22% return is attractive, but it's one time, and then those funds are sitting in their home equity, not working for them.

Paying off the house within the MHA would forego earnings if they paid the minimum and invested it for the life of the loan. Just paying the minimum and paying tax on the income would leave them with 48K - 10K = 38K to invest for the next 23.5 years. (Of course, each year passing means another 38K or so invested, but also fewer years to have it invested...)

38K invested, assuming 2.5% cost of capital (because that's what they're paying in interest annually on it), and an assumed real return of 5%, e.g., means a return of 2.5% after inflation and after factoring in the mortgage. In 23.5 years, that'd be 68K in today's dollars. Of course, there's risk to this, and only working from estimates.

I generally am in the ""don't pay off such a low rate mortgage, just invest and enjoy the liquidity and returns"" camp. But with the guaranteed tax savings, I'm wondering second-guessing that approach...

Am I thinking of this rightly? Anything I'm missing? How would you advise them? Or what questions would you ask them?

And if you'd prefer to reply privately via chat or message, please do!

82,0,"Reddit Friends,   


I am getting close to paying off debts and looking at next steps.  I am currently paying off a significant debt on a credit card.  Long story, but I was in a crunch last year and ran up about $10k on a credit card.  I now have it down to about $4k and expect to have it paid in full in the next three months.   


Once I have it paid off, I intend to pay off a debt of $9k.  I had a metal roof installed on my house and financed by the installer.  It was originally around $13k.  I now have it down to $9k @ 7.99% interest. The monthly payment is $130, but I'm paying for $420/month (because it amuses me to pay that amount).  My intention is that once the credit card is paid off, I'll raise the roof payment to $666 (because it will amuse me further to pay that amount.) Doing that should have that loan paid in full in about a year and a half.  So ... this is long term planning, I acknowledge.   


So come mid 2024 or 2025 I will be completely debt free, no personal loans, no credit card debt, etc.  I will only have my mortgages.   


I currently max out my personal ROTH contributions each year, invest an additional $200/month into a brokerage account, and invest 3% of my salary (with an employer match of 7%) for 10% of salary going into my 401k.  Once my debts are paid off, I will have about an additional $1k month for further debt reduction or investing.    


I am thinking of the following strategies:  


* I own two houses.  One a duplex.  I live in one side, rent the other side out.  My tenant's rent is roughly about the same as the mortgage.  Because I am making additional payments towards this mortgage, it should be paid off in 6 years.  The balance is around $50k @ 3% interest. Since I've had this loan for about 6 years, currently each month's payment has the amount going to principal at about twice the amount going to interest.  

*  The second home I own is a 3 BR, currently rented for about the same amount as the mortgage.  Currently balance on that one is $215k @ 5% interest. The mortgage is only about a year old, so currently each month's payment has the amount going to  interest is about three times the amount going to principal. 

I am over 50, so I am eligible to make ""catch up"" contributions to my employer's 401k plan.   


What strategies would you guys recommend I pursue with the additional money I will have each month?  Should I simply put it all into my employer's 401k plan as ""catch up payments""?  Look at paying off my duplex? This is my personal leaning. The idea of owning a completely paid off home is very appealing, but... the loan is only 3%.  Should I start making double or triple payments on my house since it's really early in the loan and it's a 5% rate ? And my duplex will be paid off in 5 or 6 years anyway?

After years writing stories for free, I jumped into the ""Writing stories for Kindle"" scene, failed horribly, and opted to switch to serialized approach over at RoyalRoad + a Patreon.

2 years of sweat, and I reached a point where I'm making enough to cover the bills and live off of my writing. Not enough to save or do much else though. And I'm worrying that I might need to change tracks if there's not much more growth available.

So the question I keep asking myself is... now what?

84,0,"I’m 25 y.o. and having somewhat of a crisis. I have a high paying job in finance, 150k salary (only 4 years out of school) but as a 9-5 it takes up most of my time and doesn’t give me the time I need to build my business. 

Over the past year I started buying real estate on the side and have worked my way up to 6 units which cash flow for me well- though nowhere close to the income I make in my w2. I love doing real estate. I want to build an empire of rentals for myself. But it is a lot of work and I need to spend even more time on it to grow in this field.  I wanted to quit my w2 in 2024 until I realized that not having a w2 makes you less bankable to lenders and that’s going to be a tough challenge for further RE purchases and larger transactions. 

So here’s my dilemma. I need a job that pays me well (so I can put those reserves into my biz) with less expectations. My job isn’t necessarily hard but I’ve been promoted so with that comes more client facing responsibilities I’m not willing to put more time into. It also eats up most of the work week for business as well so I feel like I have a huge opportunity cost. I’m willing to change jobs but it’s hard to leave the take home pay I get right now because it gives me leverage for my side hustle. 

My question to you all is- what kind of jobs are out there that require low effort and low level of skill so that I can redirect all my energy into growing my real estate business? And maybe there isn’t such job but I’d like to hope there are alternatives to what I’m doing right now.

There are different paths to take when looking for employment and a new lifestyle in Malta. The Island is an attractive place to live, enhance your career and enjoy more financial benefits. If you want the best out of it, follow our tips on landing that dream job.

## Working in Malta | Guides, and Resources

Working in Malta is very different from working in most European countries. The Maltese love the sun and the sea, so they take most of their holidays during the summer months. This means more jobs are available for seasonal workers during the summer but fewer opportunities for permanent employment.

However, if you're looking for work in Malta and are prepared to relocate, you will find many opportunities. If you're an EU citizen, they must offer you any advertised job before anyone else. But if you're from outside the EU, there may be restrictions on what kind of job you can get.

Malta is a small island nation in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Italy. It's known for its beautiful beaches and warm weather, but it's also a great workplace.

Malta is a member of the European Union and uses the euro as its currency. In addition to making your own money and paying taxes in Malta, you'll also need to be aware of tax obligations in your home country (where you pay taxes on income earned abroad).

## Work Permits

EU citizens don't need a work permit to work in Malta. However, they do need to register with the government within seven days of arriving in the country. Non-EU citizens will need a work permit if they plan on working in Malta for more than three months or if they plan on staying longer than six months in total. You can apply for this online through this website or by contacting your nearest embassy or consulate.

## Things You Should Know About Living and Working in Malta

WFDM LTD is the best recruitment agency where hundreds of employees have found their dream job over the years. We have an extensive database of companies looking for new employees and are committed to helping you find a job in Malta.

Here are some things you should know about living and working on this beautiful Island:

Malta is one of the most popular destinations for ex-pats. This island nation was once a popular holiday destination, but now it has become where people want to live permanently. There are many reasons why people choose Malta as their home country, including its climate, beautiful beaches, friendly people, and low cost of living. It has also been ranked as one of the happiest countries in Europe by the UN World Happiness Report 2019 due to its high quality of life and safety levels.

If you already have a job offer in mind or if you want to work at a specific company, we can help you find jobs near your home or apartment so that you don't have any problems with transportation every day after work hours or during weekends when there are no public transport buses available.

I started with 5% 401k and 5% Roth contributions per paycheck but there was no method to that choosing and I can change it as I please. 

I live at home with my parents still so no rent, car is paid off, no car insurance or phone bill (thank you parents), and essentially no bills at this time. I live pretty frugally without an issue normally. 

I have one private loan ($7.5k) that I’m making payments on monthly ($80 per month) and approximately $80k in student loans but obviously not paying those yet because they’re paused. I’ve considered just paying off the private loan in full but honestly have no idea if that’s a good idea or not. Other than loans no debt and I have a good credit score. 

Here’s where I need some help: I worked a lot during school and I have just over $50k sitting in my savings account. Essentially all of my paychecks have completely gone to savings and just sit there which seems wasteful and Id love to put it to good use in investments of some sorts or something so it doesn’t just sit there.

- just opening a new Roth IRA account with Fidelity &amp; leaving my Acorns Traditional as is going forward.

2. Avg future health expenses for my age and profile are about $270k - in today's dollar - per govt and CFA estimates. The long term care insurance premiums have gone really high to a point of really no return.

3. I want to stay retired, but filling up my 16 hr days seem problematic. I don't want to volunteer just for the sake of it. I do need human interaction but as a introvert not willing to go out of my way.

Q3. How did any other introvert managed this? I am highly tempted to go back to work. Essentially, save what I can outside of retirement accts and work for few more years, help build cushion.

**What are the benefits of investing in Crypto?**

Cryptocurrency has become increasingly popular in recent years as more people are turning to digital currencies for the potential to make big profits. Crypto investments can offer a variety of benefits, including a higher rate of return than traditional investments, greater liquidity, anonymity, and global access. 

First and foremost, investing in crypto offers a great opportunity for investors to potentially earn a high rate of return. Cryptocurrency markets are still relatively new and rapidly changing, meaning there are often major price movements and high volatility. This provides opportunities for traders to take advantage of price fluctuations and the potential for significant returns.

Another benefit of investing in crypto is the increased liquidity. Since cryptocurrencies are traded 24/7, investors can easily access their funds at any time. This makes it easier to move funds in and out of different positions with minimal effort and minimal market impact. 

Crypto also offers greater privacy and anonymity than many other investments. For those looking to protect their financial privacy, crypto can be an ideal choice since transactions are completely anonymous and no personal information is required for trading.

Finally, crypto investments provide access to a global market. Unlike traditional investments, cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold anywhere in the world without restrictions, making them accessible to virtually everyone with an internet connection. This gives investors the ability to diversify their portfolio by taking advantage of international markets and diverse investment opportunities. 

Overall, investing in cryptocurrency offers many potential benefits that could help investors increase their earnings and grow their portfolios. With its high volatility and global access, crypto presents a unique opportunity to take advantage of both short-term and long-term opportunities 

in the market.

**How do I start investing in Crypto?**

Getting started with investing in crypto can be a daunting prospect, but it doesn’t have to be. With the right resources and a little bit of knowledge, you can get up and running in no time.

First, you need to decide which cryptocurrency to invest in. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies available and the best option for you will depend on your individual goals. Take some time to research different coins and tokens to determine which one(s) may be best suited to your needs.

Make sure you do your research before choosing an exchange as there are many available with varying levels of security, fees and services offered.

Once you’ve chosen an exchange, you can deposit funds into your account and begin trading. The amount of money you’ll need to get started depends on the exchange and the cryptocurrency you’re investing in. Some exchanges require minimum deposits while others do not.

Finally, it’s important to stay informed and up-to-date on news related to the cryptocurrency markets. Keeping up with current trends and market movements can help you make informed decisions about when to buy and sell your investments. It’s also important to remember that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, so be sure to always manage your risk carefully.

With the right approach, anyone can get started investing in crypto. Do your research, choose the right platform, and make sure you stay informed about the markets and you’ll be well on your way to financial success.

117,0,"Context: currently mid 20s, in California

So I've calculated my estimated FIRE number with the 4% rule, but I'm worried that it's not as accurate as it could be (currently 2.5mm, but that's relatively conservative). Obviously, I realize that the number will likely change over time, but I'd like to hedge against significant expected costs, if possible. 

For example, I'd like to have a kid sometime in the next 10 years or so, but I don't have a clue how much that would impact my journey to FIRE. 

For the parents out there, how much do you expect it to ultimately cost to raise your child from birth to 22? The annual estimates I've seen are around 20-30k/year, so I'm expecting it to cost somewhere between 200k - 300k raising your child to 18. Add in some large variability if they choose to go to college, and I'm looking at a potential max of 500k/kid, which is a bit intimidating.  I'm just worried that having even a single kid might delay my FIRE age significantly (more than 5 years or so), but maybe I'm overthinking it.

And are there other life events I should be prepared for in my FIRE estimates? Maybe marriage, first house, etc.?

The more I think about this, the more the DINK life sounds great...

I wanted to Post this outlook from Vanguard.  Basically, they're project international stocks to outperform domestic stocks by 2-3% for the next 10 years.  The mantra that has been publicized in some popular videos and such really focuses heavily on domestic markets (VTSAX and Chill), however for true indexers I'd recommend doing research on **VTWAX**.  It's Cap-weighted for the contribution of world markets at about 40%.  That said, the impulsive play may be to switch to VTIAX (Vanguard International Stock Admirals), but there's a risk of missing timing, and missing the next transformational American Bull Market.

If one were to try and attach a narrative to it, the US Stock Market is still high in P/E  (\~20) due to major QE, Unfunded Tax Cuts, and Pandemic Stimulus from every angle.  If the market were to shed another 25% the underlying P/E would be within normal historic ranges. 

That said, the Rest-of-world markets also have a larger standard of living increase to incorporate into their economies.  In the US, we're all pretty close to the top of World Standard of Living as far as things you can buy are concerned.  We have grinding issues of poverty, inequity, health care, and myriad others, but the rest of the world (on the whole minus small rich western European nations) has a larger gap.

**TL;DR: The next 10 years may see the US fall behind foreign Indices.  I'd recommend considering diversification through adding VTIAX to VTSAX, or transitioning to VTWAX.**","Heads up to the ""VTSAX and Chill"" Contingent, May want to Scope out VTWAX"

* We generally try to put away $4500/month in any savings source (whether mutual fund or 401K).
* $3500 rent/month (we live in the middle of a high COL city)
* Planning for infant daycare in the next year

\-----

We will be in this high COL city for another couple years and aren't ready to move to a cheaper part of town. We are planning to have kids this year. Daycare for an infant costs $3600/month where we live; though I will also have 6 months maternity leave, so hopefully we can minimize the infant costs with daycare. Since I'm not even pregnant, we have at least another 1.5 years of savings before we'll need to pay for infant daycare. However, we are planning to ease back on our savings rate this year so that we can ""live it up"" more as a DINK.

Eventually, we hope to move to a lower COL city, but that's highly dependent on our jobs. Regardless, we won't live in the center of town for more than a few more years. When we do move in a few years, we have a vague plan to buy a house. I'm hoping that our current accessible savings (from savings account + regular mutual fund) is enough for a deposit at that time. We don't plan to be saving much while paying for daycare; possibly we'll only aim to max my 401K as I get a 50% match.

I have a few questions.

* Are we Coast FIRE? 
   * I'm confused as to what I should put in the ""Annual Spending in Retirement"" bucket, as I don't know what $30K/$50K would mean in 30 more years.
      * I also see that the median price for a nursing home is $7K. Are we supposed to plan for $14K/month in expenses by the time we retire? That seem inordinate and not what most people can do.
   * Same with current invested assets: I think we're coast fire if we take everything into account, but should we only count the retirement accounts (401K, HSA, IRA)? Considering we'll probably be taking a big chunk out of our mutual funds to buy a house in a couple years (but at the same time, we'll still have at least 2 more years of savings until then).
* Is it okay to not really plan to save while paying for infant daycare?
   * I'm hoping that our base is large enough that not saving for a couple years won't make a big dent.
* Any other feedback on our plan? Any things we should take into consideration as we continue to save for a house and plan for kids?

148,0,"Interesting debate going on over on [Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=393086) forum as there is the potential for a 529 to Roth IRA backdoor method that may be available with the recent passing of SECURE 2.0 Act.

The idea is:  Open a new 529 plan naming myself as beneficiary, put $11,000 into the plan and invest it in VTSAX, and at least 15 years from now (after the balance has grown to $35,000) roll it over to my Roth IRA

This 'loophole' hinges on whether a 529 to Roth IRA conversion requires the beneficiary to have *earned income* in the year they convert.  This nuance is important for the early retirement crowd, as they are likely to have no earned income when the conversion could first be initiated.

May be worth keeping an eye on this in the next couple years until the details are established by the IRS.  In the meantime, I'm thinking of opening a 529 under my name and putting $25 into it (minimum to open) so I can start the 15 year seasoning of the account.",Rollover from 529 Plan to Roth IRA under SECURE 2.0

162,0,"# Are I-Bonds Worth It? ... Should You Invest in I-Bonds?

&amp;#x200B;

I-bonds are Inflation protected bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury.

I-bonds' rate of return is based on the economy's **Inflation rate**.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seriesibond.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seriesibond.asp)

&amp;#x200B;

These rates adjust semi-annually, and the payout is revised accordingly.

As of January 5, 2023 as I am writing this, the current payout is **6.89%**.

[https://treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/i-bonds/i-bonds-interest-rates/](https://treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/i-bonds/i-bonds-interest-rates/)

&amp;#x200B;

You can buy I-bonds directly from the U.S. government with an account at treasurydirect (as above).

But keep in mind that the **annual limit is $10,000**, and that these bonds cannot be re-sold to others.

&amp;#x200B;

Hence we face the **two problems** with I-bonds:

* They are not scalable with more money. Only $10,000 may be invested in annually, no more.
* Their rate of return may actually decrease - the likely outcome, as inflation subsides in 2023.

So the question is.. Are there **other ways to ""Park"" money** that gives a *higher return*, that is *scalable*?

# 

# Good alternatives exist.

You can also ""Park"" your money by writing **cash-secured puts** on equities that you don't mind buying.

Take the Tesla stock ($TSLA) for example. Everyone knows this company, it is (or) was doing quite well.

Currently, Tesla has fallen quite a bit from its former glory days at \~$380 a share to now \~$110 a share.

&amp;#x200B;

As you know, that's a long way down. The pre-covid crash levels valued the stock **around $50** or so.

So what if you had a chance to buy this stock at $50, would that be a good deal? Most *might* agree.

Parking $5000, you can write (sell) a **cash-secured put option** of that you will buy 100 shares at $50.

For date of January 19, 2024 put option for that price as an example, you can get paid \~$447 for it:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA240119P00050000?p=TSLA240119P00050000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA240119P00050000?p=TSLA240119P00050000)

&amp;#x200B;

# Putting that all together,

This means that you can generate a rate of return of about \~9% annual ***if you ""like the stock""***.

But keep in mind that writing cash-secured puts carries a risk as well. **The stock could go to zero**.

So **there is inherent risk** as opposed to **bonds, which carry no risk** and are backed by the U.S.

But then, wouldn't being able to buy $TSLA at pre-covid levels a good deal? *That's up to you to decide.*

***So keep in mind that a higher rate of return is almost always accompanied by taking greater risk.***

Now for the fun part!

**Basics:**

* Salary: 100k, minus 2 months on short term disability and plus a few side gigs
* Take Home Income: 70k, +30k YoY, 4k not from primary job
* Spending: 59.5k, +30k YoY, 20k of this was unexpected/one-off
* NW: 50k, all invested, 0 liquid. I do not count my paid off vehicle

**Spending**: These were my top 5 spending categories, from largest to smallest.

1. 36% or 25k Others- gifts and family
2. 17% or 12k Basics- rent, car insurance, cell plan, and Spotify
3. 11% or 8k Food- 5k on groceries, 3k on eating out. This and travel are my primary indulgences
4. 10% or 7k Travel5: 9% or 6k Wedding

**Reflection:**

In March of this year, my parents gave me a few days notice before effectively dropping my youngest brother on my doorstep. This required my partner and I to move to and furnish a very expensive place in San Diego, CA on less than a week of notice. The ensuing legal battle also resulted in hefty lawyer fees and we had to cancel a honeymoon trip to Dublin. Once the dust settled and I no longer had my brother, we had to move again. All in, it cost $14k not counting the hidden costs of a HCOL for those few months, a second move, etc. My partner did not contribute to related expenses, including rent for the 3 months we were were in San Diego. Any quantities my parents reimbursed were subtracted from all calculations. From a financial standpoint, I don't recommend being the eldest child in a family with shit parents.

I got married in September! The wedding was perfect for us and cost 12k. My husband and I split the total, although I've loaned him 6k which I am expecting to see next year. This is why my liquid savings are still so low; I've been covering housing. We are maintaining separate finances since we have very different financial habits and goals. My new in-laws covered our honeymoon hotel as a gift, which was awesome, and we received $600 in monetary gifts. Most of the expenses were because we paid for food, lodging, and plane tickets where applicable for all 10 of our guests.

I absolutely would not have been able to do any of that without my income, and it's a miracle I handled so much unexpected spend and still came out on top for the year. I didn't keep to my budget at all, but was in survival mode for a while and just throwing money at problems until they went away. I was working a high-stress full time consulting job, a part time restaurant job, and being a 24/7 caretaker to a very mentally ill teenager (not to mention planning a wedding.) This ultimately resulted in a minor breakdown and \~2 months on short term disability, which negatively impacted my income but  allowed me to keep my consulting job (although I did quit a side gig making ramen.)

My financial goals last year were to pursue more side gigs and contribute more to my husband's student loans. I made 1.8k in side income, and I didn't contribute to his student loans at all but did loan him a significant amount. I'd consider these both successes, especially considering the circumstances. My financial goals for next year are to grow a 15k emergency fund (currently 0), be within budget at least 8 of 12 months, and max out all retirement accounts including my HSA.","FIRE Year 2 Review: +10k NW, 20k in unexpected spend"

I don't think I've ever done a FI update post before, but pre law school I would every couple of months in the daily threads. I figured I would make my (first) post here for tracking! I don't do a super diligent job tracking my expenses so I will ballpark as much as possible. 

I'm currently a 2L in law school hoping to work in public interest after graduating (such as at a Public Defender's Office or Legal Aid, pay should be around 70K). Before law school I worked in biotech, and very fortunately, my company got acquired by a large pharmaceutical and all of my options got exercised on top of 6 months of severance (when I was quitting anyways for law school LOL, such bizarrely good luck) which netted me a total of \~150K after taxes, which is really the main reason why we have so many assets (relatively speaking) for our age. 

**Income: 134K** 

Wife: 67K in the nonprofit field that is almost entirely WFH. She actually got promoted at the beginning of last year for a couple grand raise. She likes it there a lot, but they are based in a different state, so the health insurance costs quite a bit (\~$450 per month). 

Me: Also 67K (57K from independently tutoring about 10-20hours per week, 10K school stipend for my summer internship). 

**Worth (295K) (Cash/bonds: 48K) (Stock: 247K)**

Un-allocated Cash: 10K in her checking account, 10K in mine, and then 10K in our E-fund 

Allocated Cash: 8K for a 2025 wedding (we had a legal wedding back in the day at the town hall but wanted to wait to save $$ for a real one). Aiming to save up about another 8K. 

I-Bonds: 10K 

Roth IRAs: 30K in mine, 18K in hers. 

401K: 34K in mine, 18K in hers 

Joint brokerage 147K (down a good 15K despite throwing in money at it OOF). 

\*Our stocks are almost entirely VTSAX. 

**Debt:**

100K in student loans (all me LOL) 

**Expenses: ($3,645 per mo)**

I really don't track expenses but we are relatively frugal. We tend to spend a bit more around finals as I get too busy to cook and it's not really fair on the wife to front that burden. Here is my best guestimate. We also have some random expenses, like travel for us to visit home (she's not American). We also help pay for her family's air fare to come over and such. 

Rent: $1950 per month

Health Insurance (via spouse): $450 per month 

Phone: $100 per month 

Internet: $100 per month

Food: $500 per month (groceries here are so expensive!!) 

Going out to eat: \~$350 per month

Subway: variable since I bike when it's nice, but probably $120 per month 

Dog Expenses: $75 per month 

**Thoughts**

Were definitely pretty cash heavy. Going into Law School I was a little unsure of how well I could balance working with law school but the tutoring is pretty minimal, I can set it to my schedule, and has been surprisingly consistent. I've gotten pretty decent grades so far too, so I feel like it is still sustainable. I would invest it, but I think at this point we'll likely be putting some to the side for a down payment for a house, which would ideally be in about 4-5 years depending on if my wife decides grad school. We'd likely use most of our brokerage plus another chunk of cash. 

I'm not concerned about my law school debt. The school I chose has some of the best debt forgiveness (LRAP) for lawyers, which was one of the major deciding factors, so I will be relying on that to pay most of my loans. (The way it works is they pay my entire student loan payment until I start to earn &gt;110K total, so after graduating I will supplement my attorney pay with tutoring right up until the 110 mark). 

The ""sirens call"" of corporate big law does still occasionally seem appealing (I think they start at like 210K base nowadays) but it's really not the reason I went to law school and I have no interest in that field. I'm also at the point where I've only done internships for direct-client service organizations so this would be a somewhat difficult pivot anyways - for the best. 

Moving forward we will continue to max out our Roths, and then focus on our more short term goals (wedding/down deposit). I don't regret going to law school and I have really enjoyed the (small amount) of work I've been able to do via internships/externships. My attorney salary is going to be less than what I made as an associate scientist in biotech, at least at first, but I still feel like it was the right move to make. I feel like this sub can sometimes discourage ""passion"" fields, but I suppose I shouldn't be speaking too forwardly as I have only interned.

The commute from Philly is about 1hr 15 minutes (1 hour on bus, 10-15 minutes walking to and from bus stop) while commute from a rental in the suburb is about  &lt;20 min walk.   
The problem is I don't want to buy a car and almost nothing is accessible within walking distance in the suburban area. I imagine this might make my life miserable since I only go into the office 2 days/week. 

The rent is similar in both but suburb will be unfurnished while Philly apartment is furnished. However, in Philly I'll pay more income tax (1% suburb vs 3.87% Philly).  
I have to catch only 1 bus from the Philly apartment and the place is extremely nice (furnished, gym access, very new, safe walking at night, right next to bus I'll use to commute) and a easier commute to NY where my partner lives.

194,0,"Super quick back story: I worked as a software engineer full-time for the past decade and accrued about $2-2.5 million net worth at different companies over the past decade. I've always been frugal and invested most of my income. In 2015 or 2016 I became interested in FIRE and set myself up to make it happen faster. In 2021 I left my company, created a startup, and finished selling it a few days ago for about $2.5 million total after what felt like a VC-induced roller coaster ride. 

After the market crashes and subtracting taxes my net worth is currently about $4 million. About $800k of that is in home equity, but regardless, since our expenses are low it is enough to FIRE at the age of 35. I am married and my wife is 34 and expecting our first child. We are also technically working as contractors for the prior company to help ease the transition (but with basically no commitment in terms of hours) which will give us some extra cash per month and health plans.

I didn't create this post to talk about how I got to this point, but rather my inner feelings. Since FIRE'ing, which still doesn't seem entirely real, I have mostly just been sitting on my phone or computer and not really doing much. Even video games don't feel satisfying. Sure I go out sometimes for coffee or errands, and see family friends a few times a week, but there is a large sense of boredom and almost emptiness. Like, is this really it? I need to find something to do now every day. Despite reading other FIRE experiences over the years, I still somewhat hoped it would be a transformational experience. But now I understand that I am still me - if I want my life to be dramatically different, I need to actively make that happen. Money just makes it easier. 

I am also somewhat limited by my wife - since she is pregnant, and generally an anxious person, she doesn't want to do anything too crazy such as spend a year traveling or moving out of state. We are going to Miami in a week to celebrate (which should be really fun and relaxing), but that's about it. Right now I am basically home most of the time, the weather is cold right now, and even at my startup I worked from home so not much changed there. 

I'm strongly considering just working more or creating a new company, but I am very hesitant to occupy all my spare time with work again. Like is there anything else that's better that can fill the gap? Or am I just mentally supposed to work all the time? Since I spent most of my life working, it's difficult for me to switch gears and live a life of leisure or non-work related adventure.

I used to in my mind classify people into two categories, financially independent and people who are stuck working all the time, but maybe that's a wrong paradigm. Now I think people are just people. Everyone in their first person perspective has the same sorts of feelings and problems. Poor people can be happier than the rich and vice versa. Money can solve external problems or free up your schedule for new experiences, but doesn't change your perception or mind.

This whole post seems a bit rambly and I don't know the exact reason I'm even writing it. Maybe it will help someone, maybe it will help me.

I think honestly 75% of the problem is that I'm just holed up in my house too much and getting a bit stir crazy especially since it's cold out.

In the past year, I've just begin to understand how awesome compound interest is. People should learn when they're 12 or 13 on how to actually make money. 

The secret sauce is to live frugally, save as much as you can, and just invest your money in appreciating assets over time. Literally everyone can be a multi millionaire if they traditionally retire at 64 (if they really want to do it). 

They should have an investment course where students learn about stocks, a life economics course, a frugal studies course. School should teach is real life skills instead of some of the useless jargon they stuff down our throats.

I'm here looking for some advice on how to make the most the money I'm making, given a somewhat strange financial situation I have before starting the internship.

I'm a senior in CS at a very good university and here's my approximate financial footing going into the internship:

* $0 credit card debt (always pay on time in full)
* $8k cash savings in 3.3% APY HYSA
* $2k crypto (Bitcoin and Ethereum)
* $13.5k Index Fund, $6k Nvidia
   * &lt;-- Both of these were gifted to me at various times. I'm extremely grateful for these and I never touch them.
* 730 credit score
* **Internship will pay all housing and moving expenses**
   * Will earn approximately **$37k pre-tax**
* On parental health insurance
* Purchased a $7k car with cash in May (family will pay the insurance while I'm in school)
* Student loans (federal unsubsidized, will not qualify for forgiveness)  

   * $5.5k @ 2.75% APY
   * $6.5k @ 3.73% APY
   * $7.5k @ 3.73% APY
   * (Future) $7.5k @ whatever the 2023-2024 rate will be

Any advice on what to do with this internship money would be GREATLY appreciated!

* 30,000 NSO shares (80% vested, 24,000 exerciseable today)
* Strike price: \~$1 per share (I joined very early!)
* Preferred price based on last Series E round: $150
* Current FMV (409A): $40

Given these, can someone advise me on whether I should exercise now or later? Our company wants to IPO no later than 2025, hopefully at a price higher than our Series E round. Given that current FMV is $33, does it makes sense to exercise and pay taxes on a smaller difference ($33 - $1 = $32 per share), than exercising when our valuation goes back to $140 level?

There are companies like SecFi, ESO and Quid that offer different financing solutions. Some just cover exercising costs, some provide more financing.

I’m 24 and trying to get my retirement plan sorted. However after reading through Mutual of America’s 403b prospectus, the fees look very suspicious.

I’m able to do the work of managing an investment property. Since my employer (a nonprofit, hence the 403b instead of 401k) does not match contributions at any percent, I am thinking strongly that saving towards an investment property would be a better decision for building sustainable wealth.

215,0,"TL;DR - After years of careful planning still nervous to pull the trigger! 

This is a story about following FIRE subs for 4 years and then getting ready to retire. 

I learned about FIRE and investing in 2019 after using a financial planner for ~20 years.  Spent much of the pandemic reading and learning via books and online. 

4 years later, I’m managing my own portfolio, using a lazy Boglehead allocation for simplicity, and have a plan for how to withdraw and balance. 

Looks like we will pull the trigger on May 1st and the plan is to sell virtually everything, slow travel the world in LCOL countries starting with SE Asia, then Latin America, Europe, then ???  If we enjoy this, we may do it literally for years.  Check out r/Onebag to see how minimalist we are going!

There are tons of people in the subs on Reddit and blogs who have been inspirations for the plan. 

I’m thrilled, but also kind of terrified 😂 

I don’t see myself as very smart when it comes to all this, despite the research over the years. This is evidenced every day on Reddit when folks get deep into the weeds on investing and economics and I’m quickly lost.   I documented my strategy, have run every calculator 😂, incorporated plan Bs, and I think I’m being conservative to account for my inevitable mistakes.  Any recession that may happen this year should not affect the overall outcome, and even a possible low return environment for the next 10 years is accounted for.  We’re planning to “self-insure” for end of life care by retaining 25% of the portfolio.  One pleasant surprise was realizing I have enough in my taxable brokerage account to not even need a Roth ladder or 72t before I’m 59.5. 

Yet as all the planning comes to a head, and it’s pencils down, I keep wondering what I’ve missed.  Where I’ve made or will make mistakes. I’m 50 and to me failure means having to return to work after 10? years out of the workforce. 

I’m assuming these are normal feelings for many folks who retire early and I just have to step off the ledge.  Watch out for that last step… it’s a doozy.

So I assume there used to be brokerage fees (which I was unaware of) however, since they have terminated those fees? is this correct? I have never sold any ETFs thus far.

A lot of my peers keep telling me I am investing far too frequent - which is going to results in high brokerage fees. However, I am very sure they are incorrect.

My questions:

1. Is there brokerage fees to me investing my $576 fortnightly?
2. Is the management fee the **ONLY** fee where I will lose money? (unless I sell my etfs)
3. When I log onto vanguard - press portfolio - press one of the ETFs I have invested in it says for example - 3.92%. Does this same number show for everyone? or does it just show that my investments are down that number?
4. I am doing my tax return - I have never sold any ETFs, so I have never made a profit. Do I need to report this?

It just feels like I am down quite a few thousand - at around 34k when Ive invested about 38k. So I am just trying to understand all the potential hidden fees. 

Really appreciate anyone taking the time to answer this - It would be great to have a fellow vanguard mentor I could ask some questions to. Still struggling to understand a lot of this.

I’m introverted and have always enjoyed working by myself and having lots of  autonomy. I worked in a credit/risk role before this and liked the actual day to day job more, especially when remote work started becoming more popular during COVID. I loved WFH and I hate that I can’t do it anymore, despite it becoming popular among lots of jobs. 

I took my current position because you can make more money on the sales side. I could go back to the credit/risk side and probably still make what I make now, although my long term income ceiling will be lower. I never wanted a sales job, I just thought that was the path I was supposed to take since it made more money. 

Is it wrong to want a job more aligned with my strengths and personality, even if it means my income potential will be lower? I’m struggling mentally with this.

Hello everyone,

My house is paid off and worth \~850 K. I feel that I'm not making use of the value of the house now that it is paid off.

I have been investing in low-cost mutual funds tracking the S&amp;P for the past 20 years, and that is the bulk of my net worth.

Would getting a loan toward the value of the home make sense? I was thinking to pull out maybe 5 to 600K and immediately invest 4 to 500K in an S&amp;P fund (or dollar cost average in over the next 6 months).

I was going to keep 1 to 200K on hand to help manage the monthly payments as I am in a ""soft"" retirement phase of my life, no active income, other than my investments.

I do have excellent credit, so was thinking the amount I borrow would be at a rate far below what my investment accounts will average over the next 10 years.

1. Do you guys think this is a good idea?
2. What are my loan options, is it just a HELOC, or is there another option? (I ran across something called a cash out refinance, which sounds great, but there's no active loan on the home now, so not really refinancing)

Thank you kind redditors for your input, and happy new year to everyone!

235,0,"Over the last few months, I have been watching social media influencers like Alex Hermozi &amp; Codi Sanchez and I have finally decided to take action on investing in Small businesses. However, after 4 months of working with the SBA advisor group (SCORE) it is clear that I am still nowhere near ready to invest in a business by myself at this point as (I feel) that I do not have the experience yet to confidently run a business. In addition, I currently have an unrelated (high-paying) job and I am not ready to make the leap into entrepreneurship until I have some experience in the spaces I'd like to invest. While the businesses are simplistic in nature (ie. Gas Stations &amp; Laundromats) I recognize that there are many complexities that I am unequipped to deal with having had zero experience in the space. Additionally, I am limited in the funding I can throw into the business god forbid something goes wrong. For this reason, I have concluded that for my first deal, I do not want to be on the hook for the full equity amount of the business until I understand more about the space

The current solution that I would like to pursue is to bring one or multiple equity partners to help me on my first deals so that I can learn the ropes. From my previous explorations in RE I understand that there are scenarios where ""wholesalers"" bring investors deals in exchange for equity in the property and the ability to see how investors underwrite and manage deals. Do these scenarios also exist in the world of small business acquisitions? If so, where do I find these individuals other than PE groups?

238,0,"\[Apologies in advance for the long post\]

\[Tried posting in the weekly FIRE thread but didn't get a whole lot of traction - trying again here :). Moderators: this is not the right locations, please feel free to delete\] 

**Introduction**

We're a dual-income, no kids married couple living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I’ve been a lurker on this forum for a while and really appreciate the sense of community we have. We know that we are in a very privileged position, and we are also not perfect with our finances, so would appreciate everyone’s advice. 

**Age / Industry / Location**

I’m 33 and my partner is 37. I work in Tech and my partner works in Health Care, both focusing on Strategy and Operations. We have lived together in New England since 2018 and recently moved to the Bay Area in 2022

**Target FIRE Age / Amount / Withdrawal Rate / Location**

Our overall goal is to reach financial independence so we can work on our own terms while maintaining an upper-middle-class lifestyle.

* **Target financial independence age**: \~late 40s/early 50s. Given how driven we both are, I doubt we would retire at this point, but we may decide to scale back on work. Even after we fully retire, I think we may actually pick up some part-time jobs (e.g. I teach Zumba and Dancing, my partner does MBA and Career coaching on the side)
* **Amount**: \~$4M-$6M net worth
* **Withdrawal rate**: \~4%, but honestly this is more the rule of thumb we know about and haven’t thought much about this
* **Location**: I’m from South East Asia (my parents and entire extended family are there), while my partner is from Pennsylvania. We want to be able to split our time between South East Asia and the US (uncertain on US location at the moment, but likely CA/MA/PA)

**Educational Background &amp; Plans**

We both have MBAs, and my partner also has an MS in Information Systems. We do not plan to get more education. 

* I went to a top 3 Liberal Arts college and a top 10 US MBA school, both with full ride scholarships/financial aid (very fortunate and privileged situation I must admit). 
* My partner went to a top 30 national university and top 10 healthcare-focused US MBA school, with some outstanding student loan debt (broken out in the Debt section below).

**Career Context &amp; Plans**

We’re both mid-career professionals (\~10 years of work experience) and have been relatively successful (we think). We plan to stay in our current industry (Tech for me, Healthcare for my partner) but have NO desire to make it to c-suite level executives. 

* **My career path**: Financial Data Analyst (\~4 years), Strategy Consultant and Manager (\~3 years), Tech Strategy and Operations (\~2 years)
* **My partner’s career path**: Healthcare Provider Operations (\~4 years), Healthcare Payer Strategy &amp; Operations (\~8 years)

**Current / Future Income Breakdown**

Current total comp between the two of us is \~$420K all in, broken out as follows:

* Base salary: \~$330K
* Cash-based bonus: \~$50K. Target 15% bonus rate for both of our companies, assuming average performance)
* Equity: \~$40K. I receive RSU from my Tech company. We usually do not sell these and hold onto them as part of our our long-term retirement

I anticipate receiving **a promotion mid-2023**, in which case our **total comp** would probably **jump to \~$500K-$520K** via base salary and equity increase (full year basis, pro-rated for 2023 it’s probably a 25% bump)

In addition, we have the following retirement income matches from our company:

* **My employer**: 50% match up to maximum 401k contribution, comes out to about \~$11K since I always max out my 401k
* **My partner’s employer**: 5% match-free salary contribution starting after two years of full-time work (he joined in the past 6 mo)
* **My partner’s employer also provides a pension** that vests after 5 years of service, fully vested after 30 years. At the 30 year mark the pension is anticipated to pay out \~50% of final salary including a spousal survival benefit

**Net Worth** 

* Our current total net worth is \~$750K, with \~$1.8M in total assets (including primary residence + cars) and \~$1.05M in total liability

**Asset &amp; Debt breakdown, including home, cars, etc**: total is $1.8M including primary residence + car + emergency savings. If we exclude these, it’s about $670K in invested assets 

* **Primary residence ($1.05M)**: we recently bought a 2B2B condo in Oakland CA at $1.05M. It’s in a great building and the primary school ranking is 8/10. We plan to stay here at least for the next 5 years
* **1 Car ($31K):** we bought our plug-in hybrid car about a year ago before the earlier federal tax credit ran out and have successfully obtained California CAV decal stickers for discounted FasTrak bridge/HOV lane tolls
* **401k ($415K):** total 401k balance between us two. I would say most of these are pre-tax dollars and invested in target retirement index funds/S&amp;P 500 index funds
* **Roth IRA ($175K)**: total Roth IRA contribution between us two. Some of these are converted 401k from my prior employers, some are direct back-door and mega-backdoor Roth contributions. All invested in target retirement index funds/S&amp;P 500 index funds
* **HSA ($15K)**: we haven’t been contributing to HSA in recent years since our old companies did not offer a high deductible health plan. We plan to start contributing this year and plan to use this as a savings vehicle rather than a healthcare expense vehicle. All invested in target retirement index funds/S&amp;P 500 index funds
* **Brokerage investment ($18K)**: every month we put \~$800 into after tax brokerage accounts, but likely will have to reallocate this to our HSA and LPFSA contribution starting this year. All invested in target retirement index funds/S&amp;P 500 index funds
* **Equity ($45K):** this is my vested equity amount. Have been holding onto it for a while
* **Emergency savings ($50K):** this sits in a high yield online savings account

**Debt breakdown**

* **Primary residence ($995K)**: we recently bought our home and got a 5.75% credit union mortgage rate. Obviously hoping to refinance if mortgage rates were to come down. 
* **Car loan ($33K)**: We got our car loan at an extremely cheap credit union rate (&lt;2%). 
* **Student loan ($27K)**: my partner has a minimal outstanding federal student loan balance, combined interest rate is 5.5%

**Budget breakdown** \- note that we recently purchased a home + switched health plans, so those items are definitely just an estimate. If you all notice anything strange with this budget, would appreciate your feedback.

* **Monthly income (all-in, pre-tax)**: \~$35K
* **Monthly pre-tax salary**: \~$27.5K
* **Automated monthly investment:** \~$11K
   * **GSU vesting**: \~$3K pre-tax
   * **401k pre-tax savings**: \~$3.75K (=$22.5K\*2/12) - we maxed out our pre-tax 401k savings between the two of us 
   * **Roth IRA savings**: \~$1.1K (=$6.5K\*2/12) - we both contribute to our Roth IRA using our back-door Roth contribution
   * **401k after-tax savings**: \~$2.7K - my employer’s 401k plan offers after-tax contribution and in-plan conversion, so I also contribute this to the max
   * **HSA and Limited Purpose FSA contribution**: \~$730
* **Housing expenses**: \~$8K
   * **Mortgage P&amp;I**: $5.8K. Definitely want to refinance to reduce this amount
   * **PMI**: $233. Definitely want to pay down our mortgage so we can get rid of this PMI
   * **HOA**: $750. Yes this is quite a bit, but our building has a lot of amenities which I enjoy, and this is still about ⅓ lower than equivalent buildings in our neighborhood
   * **Property taxes**: $1.1K
   * **Home Insurance &amp; warranty**: $100 
* **Other debt payment**: \~$1.3K
   * **Car**: $625
   * **Student loan**: $650
* **Other Expense**: \~$5K
   * Grocery + eating out: $3K (yes we know this is a lot and are hoping to reduce this in the near future)
   * Car insurance + Gas/EV: $200
   * Out of pocket medical expense: $800
   * Subscription: $400 (yes, we know we have a lot here - Spotify, Hulu, Netflix, HBO, Disney+, YouTube, Economist, WSJ, NYTimes, Google Drive)
   * Everything else would be a miscellaneous expense (e.g. entertainment, dancing classes, shopping, gifts, travel, etc.)

**Health concerns**

We’re both relatively healthy and active, though we could 100% benefit from losing weight and eating healthier, which is one of our 2023 goals. We do utilize a lot of therapy / mental health services to deal with our stress. We are trying out a high-deductible health plan in 2023 which will either be a longer-term good idea or a one-time effort soon to be abandoned. 

**Family: current situation / future plans / special needs / elderly parents**

We want to have kids, but not 100% sure on timing, likely not in the next 5 years. We both value education quite a bit and so would want to save for their education.

My parents fortunately have saved enough for their comfortable retirement, though we want to be able to help them with international trips etc. 

My partner is a bit estranged from his family, though when push comes to shove we would likely end up supporting part of his parents’ retirement.

**Questions?**

* Are we on track for our financial independence goals (\~$4M-$6M net worth by late 40s/early 50s)? If not, what are some things we could tweak to reach this goal?
* What are some considerations we should have given that we just closed on our first home?

- $6k in a 401k invested in a 2060 target retirement fund, I contribute 25% of my income pre-tax bi-weekly (max contribution limit through my workplace)

- $0.5k in a taxable account invested in various stock (no strategy here yet)

- $10k in HYSA (what I consider to be my emergency fund)

- $5k in a checking account

My expenses average around $2k a month, with $1.6k going to rent and the rest going to food, utilities, wifi, etc.  With a take-home of around $3.2k, I am saving 38.5% of my take-home on top of the 25% going to my 401k.

- At 25% of 76k, I will be contributing under the 401k limit this year. Should I invest more into a taxable account then? If so, should I follow a low risk-boglehead strategy here too with VTI/VXUS?

I discovered FI/RE as a college senior in 2016, but didn't have the means to do much about it until 2017-2018. My journey isn't as extreme as some others, but I figure more data points are never a bad thing. My biggest jumps have come in the last two years due to a few things:

	• No other long-term debt. My parents busted their asses on teacher's salaries to pay for my school. I plan to do the same for my children. Bought car with cash. 
	• Wife had an athletic scholarship in undergrad and got tuition waived for grad school. Her car is also paid off. 


**Background / Job 1**
Middle Class upbringing in a flyover state. Degree in Finance from a state school. Average student (3.1gpa) - cared more about having fun and making connections than studying. Had a few internships that led me to believe my starting salary would be $60k-$80k (2016). Struggled to find ""the right"" job due to my own expectations &amp; ego. Ended up taking an entry-level job at a regional bank…talk about high finance! Starting salary: $44k.

**Job 2**
A college buddy recommended me for an analyst job at his firm. I didn't know much about the job or the company, but I interviewed because I hated my job. It turns out the interview was for a position as the COO's personal analyst. The company was doing ~$1.3B in revenue at the time. The COO liked me, so I got the job and a slight pay bump - $53k. Formed a great relationship with the COO and he gave me a few promotions while I got to learn everything about the business directly from him. 
Tenure &amp; Final Comp: 3 years, $86k

**Job 3**
Our company was recapitalized and the COO was forced out. I put some feelers out and wound up with a bigger role at a similar, but smaller, company (~$100mm revenue). Had some big professional wins, but also had to dodge some major internal political conflict and handle covid concerns. Not ideal long-term. I was brought on at $105k with a 20% bonus. I made it 13 months before my old boss called…""Hey man, I'm the new CEO at *Generic Company Name*, I want you to come work for me."" Which led to…

**Job 4 (Current)**
Growing company ($300mm rev) in a related industry. After some negotiating, he brought me on in a junior leadership role at $140k + 20% bonus, a $10k signing bonus, and a piece of equity. Not banking on the equity materializing, but if we hit our share price targets, it could be worth ~$500k-$700k for me in 18-24 months. 



**Disclaimers/Relevant Detail**
	• Parents were uber-frugal and saved for 4 sons to go to college on middle class wages. My parents got me a car for my 16th birthday, I sold it after college to fund a portion of my next car which helped me avoid a car payment.
	• Our wedding and honeymoon limited our savings potential the past 12 months, but we enjoyed the heck out of both.
	• Definitely victims of lifestyle creep. We are fairly social and have been to 15-20 weddings the past 2 years all over the country. We spent 2 weeks in Europe for our honeymoon.
	• These income levels are still new for us, but we're shooting to save/invest 30-40% every year. As of this week we're planning on spending my salary and banking hers...TBD on how well that works.
	• My companies have all had horrible 401k programs (low or no match), so that's an area in which I might have been more successful under different circumstances.
	• Real Estate = Net Equity in our primary residence. This number has fluctuated vastly based on the market, but I'm comfortable tracking it like this. I won't be surprised if home values in our area drops 10% more, but that's life.
	• I know we have done ok, but I still kick myself thinking of things I could've done better. Start investing earlier, cook at home more, travel less…at the same time, I have a wife I adore, we have means to do the things we love, and we have a furry brown monster who keeps us busy and happy.


We have definitely focused on career growth more than savings rate at this point, but we're planning on having 2-3 more DINK years to pack on some savings before kiddos come along.

If anyone has any tips for this, feel free to share! Also if it matters, I’m 25F working in healthcare/research.


I only became financially literate in April 2022 after I decided I was no longer happy at my (then) job. Some rough personal things also happened and I realized that financial independence would offer me safety and help me have more control over my own life. Because of this, I set out to grow my net worth to $50k by 2023, which seemed impossible because my monthly savings were about $1000 on average after my personal expenses and necessities. I started in Apr with ~$25k (amount left over after years of careful budgeting, working part time through school, and paying off my hefty student loans). 


30Apr ‘22: NW $25242. Deeply educated myself about finances, investing, and good financial habits. Found a new job much closer to home with a $6 hourly bump from my last one with a better health benefits package. Put my first $100 in WealthSimple Invest TFSA (now at $25k in Jan 2023).

31May ‘22: Didn’t record NW. Started at new job and had much better work-life balance.

30Jun ‘22: Didn’t record NW. Recognized emotional spending habits and started a RONB to save more money.

30Sep ‘22: NW $36524. Got my first longer contract.

31Oct ‘22: NW $43264. Took 10 days off for family vacation. Fully booked with clients. Learning how to freelance on top of a FT job and make good use of my time.

30Nov ‘22: NW $50466. Got into car accident and struggled with mental health difficulties. Distracted from work and freelancing. *met my goal days before the accident :/

31Dec ‘22: NW $52261. Car repair costs. Christmas gifts. Total freelance earnings reached $11k to date. Started 3-month contract with new client.

Hello all, this year in review is something we've been contributing for a few years now. Numbers are for 2 adults. If anybody would like a copy of the sheet I use you can click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11_8-x72AhngLG2sN2L9fRTPdqUOkkxDXH3MsJv8k3Gk/copy). As usual, let me know if anything doesn't jive!

Here is a link to last year's submission: [2021](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/rtltdg/2021_year_in_review_my_4th_annual_submission/)

For the last 7 years, at the end of the year I always crunch some numbers to see how our finances look in order to get a complete picture of our path towards financial independence. I add up all of our major assets, subtract all of our debts and come up with our net worth and find the year over year changes.

I then separately add up our retirement assets (essentially net worth subtracting home equity), figure out what our average monthly expenses were and perform some rudimentary calculations to project how many years from being Financially Independent we are. Essentially, I follow [MMM's Shockingly Simple Math](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/)

Note: I actually began tracking all of this in the middle of 2015. So there is a bonus 6 months at the start that can be more or less disregarded for purposes of looking at annual variations.

### Numbers

* Net Worth Change: +7% 
* Debt Change: -25%
* Retirement Change: +2.7%
* Monthly FI Expenses Change: +1%
* Savings Rate Change: +4%

Final Savings Rate: 75%

Years until FI (change from last year): 5 (0)

### Reflection &amp; Goals

All in all we had a fantastic year as far as the financial picture is concerned, even if it didn't move the needle much as far as possible FI goes. Any increase, no matter how small, in net worth and our accounts after a year where the markets were down so much I'm going to consider a huge win.. even if it's all from contributions and increased property valuation. 

It's humorous to me that as I wrote last years update I realized my allocations were out of whack and far too bond heavy. I ended up moving around $150k from bonds to international stock in Q1 last year, unfortunately half of that total came on the first of the year. Ahh well, live and learn. At least I got our asset allocation corrected and we didn't have to touch anything the rest of the year. As of today it's looking pretty good, still about 5% more cash heavy than I would like but will be buying more VTSAX in the brokerage (Finally opened one a couple of months back) with it over the next couple of months and possibly purchasing a new vehicle. Current allocations are:

* Domestic Stock: 40%
* International Stock: 37%
* Bonds: 10%
* Cash: 13%

Now that I've got the Asset Allocation figured out and our brokerage has been opened, our goals for finances are largely to just ignore things this year and continue to throw excess funds in the brokerage. We've already made our yearly i-bond purchase and due to our IRA balances and employer 401k plans M/BDR is a no-go. I suppose I should learn what the heck ""Tax Loss Harvesting"" is at some point, but don't think it's urgent. Mostly just on auto-pilot mode. 

On the life side of things, last year continued to be stressful as ever and we need to continue to focus on personal health and long-term sustainability career and lifestyle wise. My wife and I are both burnt out and seeking change. Personally I loathe the idea of retiring early about as much as the idea of needing a job until old age, so would very much like to find some sort of gig that better aligns with my needs. Applied for a few jobs last year but no luck so far.

We solidified a lot of things that were up in the air last year or things we knew we should do but just never got around to chiefly planning end of life things with an estate attorney and making decision not to have children permanent. It's nice to not have to worry about the what-ifs there, both financially and as far as life goes. I find that those types of things always add a constant level of background noise and stress to us, so it's best when we talk them out, make a decision and then take action.

I wish I had more concrete goals honestly.. but other than ""don't fuck it up"" and ""be healthy and happy"" I find it difficult to form them when I am mostly-content. Getting comfortable with being secure and content has been difficult enough the last couple of years, but here we are. I guess next up I need to get comfortable with the idea of being old and death.. but I'm not ready for that just yet LOL.

Lastly, I want to say that I appreciate all of the information and banter from all of you in the daily, especially over the last couple of years, as I think that we really are helping people reach some of their financial goals, as well as providing a ""community"" feel to this sub that a lot of folks appreciate. I've been absorbing information posted here for a decade now and it has been a great help on my journey.

257,0,"Hello r/FI community and Happy New Years! 

A recurrent topic in the subreddit is the degree of moderation - whether it is over-moderated, under-moderated, or just right. This discussion has come up to a greater extent over the last few months with [the recent addition of our newest batch of moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/xxy87e/welcoming_our_new_additions_to_the_moderation_team/). We’ve been working to try and let more discussion topics through and give the home page more activity - but many in the community still feel it isn’t enough, still acting as gatekeepers to people looking for a new view on their finances and life.

This is a great corner of the internet where discussion can take place without being sidelined by politics or incivility - and that will never change as long as we are moderators - but much of the rest is potentially open for debate. Some of the criticisms we have received have been regarding the fact the subreddit isn’t as newbie friendly as it could be, that we require too much effort to start a top level post, and that this harms engagement. 

Honestly - we see some of the points, and have decided to run a bit of an experiment to start off the new year. For the next four weeks, we are proud to announce: 

# Low-Mod January Community Enhancement Event!!!! 
*^fireworks, ^cheers ^and ^applause*

For the entire month of January, the mod team will only enforce [Rules 2, 3 and 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/wiki/rules). For those who (for some reason) haven't memorized them (or clicked the link) - 2 is no spam, advertising or promotion, 3 is be civil, and 7 is no gender, politics or circle-jerks.

Why only those - these are the hallmark of the mature and respectful community we have here, and something that no one on the mod team wanted to subject our community to a removal of. Additionally, they are more behavioral rules rather than 'topic' or 'idea' type rules. We still want - and expect - mature discussion here, and these are not things we will bend on.

**So what does this mean, really?** 

The mod team will not be removing stuff that breaks the other rules of our community. Additionally, we won't be pushing or directing people to use the daily or weekly threads.

This means that basic questions, surveys, feedback requests, and just general finance topics will be temporarily allowed. Additionally, we have increased the number of reports needed for an auto-remove (so spam can still be hit, but normal posts are unlikely to reach the new threshold before a mod sees it), and have greatly lowed the karma threshold to allow more new/throwaway type accounts to post. 

Basically, treat this community as you do the rest of the reddit. Post where and what you think best fits the theme and feel of the community.

**What does this not mean?**

The mod team is not disappearing. We are still going to be around. We are still going to be removing stuff that doesn't follow rules 2, 3 or 7. We will still be banning people for breaking those rules, this isn't a free pass to act like a child. Bad actors will still be dealt with appropriately.

**So no more daily thread?**

Actually, the daily and weekly threads are going to stay as well. A good amount of the community likes the discussion and sense of community of these threads, so we are leaving them. Maybe discussion will continue, maybe not. We honestly have no idea. We want to give everyone as many ways to enjoy this sub as you want.

**And at the end???**

Honestly - we don't know yet. **We will go back to the normal rules on Feb 1**. The mod team has committed to having on going discussion between now and the end of the month about how stuff is going. Depending on those discussions, and how the community reacts to the month in general, we will determine the path forward. 

It's likely that we'll do some sort of survey/feedback gathering in early Feb as well, to ensure that everyone has a say. Additionally, we will likely pin this thread a couple of times throughout the month as a way to centralize feedback on how stuff is going. 


And that's the plan. Let us know thoughts below, both now and during the 'community enhancement event'.

258,0,"My wife and I are freshly 40 years old with a little one on the way.

We currently have $1.5 million saved in retirement accounts (a lower number than last year due to the abysmal performance of the markets). We have about two years of living expenses on hand; house paid off. 

My wife’s salary is around $20,000 per year and mine is around $280k. Mine is from running a service oriented business. 

Building my business to that point has broken me; mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I can’t sleep at night; cortisol pumps through my veins and stress dominates every aspect of my life. I can’t even enjoy my wife’s pregnancy. In my wife’s words, I have become a shell of a person. 

Ideally, we’ve discussed coast-firing, starting today and until age 49, at which point, full fire with 90-100k per year. 

I appreciate all suggestions but I must share:

I’m not able to sell my business; it relies on me and me alone. When I’m done, it’s done. This is because of relationships with my clients. Imagine a barber with clients and those clients only want to be cut by that specific barber. Trying to sell my business would be like a barber trying to sell his customer list. 

I’m not going to start exercising and eating better to manage stress; I’m a former athlete and former model. My fitness and nutrition leave nothing to be desired with the exception of the damage from constant stress. 

I’ve already tried therapy at least 15 times. Honestly, I find Reddit forums more helpful. Real people sharing real solutions and experiences. 

Work and maintaining clients is so stressful and is the reason I’ve gotten to this point. That’s the catch 22: I have a nice amount of money saved because of the grind but I don’t even feel like a man or a quality husband anymore because of the grind. What kind of father am I going to be?

My wife and I have discussed my closing the business and getting a lower stress job to coast. The downside of this is that I would feel like I’m leaving too much money on the table by walking away from my current business. 

The only true answer that I see is to continue with my current job but let clients go, work less, and just capitalize on the time that I do spend at work. This is the challenge; just thinking about making less gives me anxiety. I want to throw up. I tried so hard to build my business and the thought of moving in reverse physically ills me. 

I spent virtually the last 15 years building my business. Years of 7 day work weeks, years of little to no sleep, years of stress GRIND STRESS SAVE MONEY STRESS GRIND STRESS SAVE MONEY. I’ve had to sleep on the floors of my business before, give up time with my family, ruin relationships with exes, etc. 

I feel like a zombie who has been walking through a nightmare for a decade. I just don’t know how to let go, cut down, and be ok working a much shorter work week at a much lower salary. If I did so, I feel like I would have the same problems as now but I would just be making less. For example, if I’m making $280k and living with the constant stress and anxiety of trying to maintain that salary or make more money next year, if I cut down to $150k, won’t I be living with the same stress and anxiety of trying to maintain $150k?

I come from a poor family and a scarcity mindset; I never thought I would be able to make money doing anything. For over a decade, I’ve been afraid my business is going to implode and I’m going to lose everything. Now, I just want to hit fire and never go back to it; I want to be a viable husband to my wife and an involved father to my son. I want to live life. 

Has anyone had a similar experience or can offer a shift in perspective? I posted this in fire because it’s all involving fire. I need a plan to coast fire or fire or something to get out. I’m so convinced that if I drop in salary that I’m going to lose the whole business. I’m at the lowest point I’ve ever been; can’t eat, sleep, or even feign a smile. 

Thanks in advance. 

Some things I’ve realized after reading through many responses in fire abs coast fire subreddits. 

I haven’t built a business; I’m simply self employed. 

I value my worth based on the amount of money I make. Saving large amounts of money makes me feel secure. 

The idea of making less sends physical tremors up and down my body. I worked so hard to build up to this point; it makes me physically ill just thinking about it.",High salary job in pursuit of fire destroyed my soul. Now I have a little one on the way and need advice.

Hello,

So I found out about the Backdoor Roth IRA late and just made an account with fidelity.

I contributed $6000 (post tax) to traditional IRA with plan to convert to Roth IRA before 12/31/22 ended but it seems like the $6000 hasn't settled and I'm unable to convert it yet. I'll be converting it as soon as I can in 2022. I have no other IRAs or anything. Just have 403b that I started earlier this year (2022).

1. How do I go about it when it comes to reporting taxes?
2. Do I get taxed/pro-rata? on this $6000?

&amp;#x200B;

I’m posting here because I need advice on how to become financially independent. I am hoping to get some suggestions based on my current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m a single mother. My son is only 3 y.o. So, I have a full-time job and a part-time freelance job. I’m working really hard so we can have a decent life. I’m also trying to be a good mother, but I guess I've failed at this job. The father of my child left us when my baby was born. Maybe it happened after 2-3 months of happy parenthood.

&amp;#x200B;

You can’t even imagine how tired I am. I don’t even remember when I had a proper day off from all my duties and dedicated some time to myself. That’s why my biggest dream is to reach financial independence, retire a bit earlier, and have some time for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

But with all my taxes, it seems impossible to put something in the savings account. Well, I try to put 10% of my paycheque in savings. But I can barely make the ends meet. I can’t afford so many things. If this is adult life, I don’t wanna it at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, now the tax office takes most of my income. It’s unfair. Aren’t there any benefits for single mothers like me?

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, things seem to be a bit better. I’ve recently run into my friend who works as an accountant. I shared my story with her, and she said I shouldn’t pay so much in taxes. She said it seemed like my employer didn’t specify some of my working shifts. He didn’t put that I sometimes work hours to make some extra cash. Well, she was in a rush and couldn’t explain it in more detail. That’s why I’ve decided to post here.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I’ve tried surfing the web and finding something useful. So, I found an online paystubs generator. But it seems a bit complicated to fill in all the info there. Besides, if I put the money I make as a freelancer, does it affect my taxes in a positive for my way?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for reading my rant here. I would appreciate any advice if you know how to help me.",The tax office basically takes all my money. Is it even possible to reach financial independence with all these taxes?

263,0,"I have the finances to be able to max my 401k every year. 

I make $56,000 annually but have no expenses except $50 a month due to living with family. 

If I were to max my 401k, I would have to up my contributions to 32% to achieve $20,500 at the end after their 5% match. 

Aside from my 5% 401k contribution, I currently invest $600/year to crypto, $1,200/year to growth stocks, $8400 to dividend investing, and $6500 to Roth IRA. All in all, I invest $19,500 and save around $36,500. 

I plan to start business’s soon and also invest in a endeavor that will hopefully yield me 50%+ returns annually. I have so many ideas to put money towards but I am not sure if I should contribute 32% of my income to maxing my 401k? Is it worth it? 

I could lower my $8400 in dividend investing but as I have seen, investing in it now and watching it compound year after year is far more beneficial than 401k’s possible growth. (Having more years for it to snowball)

TLDR: I invest $19,500/year and save $36,500. If i max my 401k it will take 32% of income and I would only save $18,837. Are 401k’s worth it anymore after the match or should I pursue my side endeavors that may workout and give me good wealth?",Are 401k’s worth it after match?

I've been working in tech for about 6 years. In 2022, I quit my job in late September after finding another job (unrelated to the tech layoffs this year). I thought it would be nice to take an extended vacation and set my start date for 2023.

My cash-flow and investment strategy is entirely hands-off. My checking account is configured to invest any amount above $4000 into my brokerage account, and refill up to $3750 via a margin loan when it goes beneath that amount. I don't have an emergency fund — I subscribe to [ERN's thoughts on keeping everything invested](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/05/05/emergency-fund/). So that means I was going to have to live off of $4k + margin for three months. It's interesting to consider because I would have had the same financial scenario had I been laid off.

# Finances

In 2021, I spent $47k (comparable to previous years, trending slightly upwards), but in 2022, I spent a staggering $95k. This was due to a lot of larger purchases: $20k car (bought in cash); $8k medical bill; $7k on vacation; $6k on wedding deposits (expecting to run up to $30k total over this year).

For discretionary expenses from 2021 to 2022:

* Eating out: $4.3k → $5.1k
* Leisure: $3.7k → $2.9k
* Vacation: $3.2k → $7.7k
* Gifts: $3.1k → $3.6k
* Dates: $2.3k → $3.5k
* Productivity: $0.5k → $1.8k

I don't feel bad about spending more on dates, gifts, or productivity. Eating out and leisure together total around the same amount. I incurred &gt;2x more vacation costs in 2022; probably a combination of relaxed COVID restrictions and attributing one 2023 vacation to 2022 costs.

I incurred \~$20k of margin debt in Q4 2022... and I feel fine! The margin is drawn against a \~$600k account. Recent interest rate increases mean that I'm paying more in interest for that margin, but it's a small enough amount (in relative terms) that I don't feel the need to sell stock to pay it down. To be honest, if I were laid off, I would be comfortable spending several more months without income in order to find a good job, rather than just the first one available. What a luxury!

I think the lesson here is that I need to adjust my expected spending rate in retirement higher to accommodate for larger expenses which I historically haven't had a lot of. Living off of margin, without an emergency fund, hasn't presented a problem so far.

# Sabbatical

So I get to take a sabbatical and go on test-FIRE for three months! My top goal was to reestablish to a routine gym schedule and go 100% of days when not traveling. I used a habit tracker and I've gone 80% of days in total, which I consider a success overall. I've built a significant amount of strength since reestablishing a schedule.

My secondary goals were:

* Play my favorite video game competitively. I went to in-person tournaments and improved my skill level in some areas, but honestly, I'm performing about as well in Jan 2023 as in Jan 2022. I think I need to get a coach, analyze my games more, and establish a better technical practice routine.
* Arrange music. I did very little of this, to be honest. I still feel very much limited by my instrumental performance ability, not my arrangement ability. However, my performance ability has significantly increased over 2022, and I think especially during my sabbatical period, so I don't think I need a change of strategy yet.
* Learn a new language. Given that I wasn't really immersing myself, I didn't expect to have a lot of success, but I fun doing vocabulary practice and puzzling out the translations of memes.
* Do more open-source software development. I was productive and even accumulated my first GitHub sponsors.
* Write more blog posts. I wrote 5 total in 2022, of which 4 were during the sabbatical period. I got 2.7k views on my most popular post among those.
* Spend more time with friends and family. Well, I certainly wanted to spend more time with them, but they were still all working their jobs, so they couldn't just skive off whenever they wanted. So I planned a few events ahead of time for us (and was able to drive us all there, thanks to the purchase of a car), and visited some of them for lunch/dinner during/after their workdays.

It's clear that I have plenty to do to occupy myself without a job. I haven't really felt the need to quantify or assess my goals formally, as long as I'm doing something from the above in a given day.

Setting a routine for the day is really important to avoid wasting time and regretting it afterwards (wasted time which was enjoyed is not wasted!). I started going to cafes in the mornings with my laptop, just to get out of the house and have a change in scenery. In retirement, I think I'll have to plan to have a space outside the house, whether it's some assortment of cafes, parks, or even a coworking space to hang out in. That will be an important consideration when deciding what neighborhood to live in in retirement.

# Takeaways

* Margin isn't that scary; consider it.
* Plan for more big one-off expenses.
* I don't feel bad spending more on loved ones; and that's an easy type of spending to cut back on, if necessary.
* Sabbaticals are good. Plan things for your friends.
* Prioritize one habit or behavior to establish at a time, and measure that. The rest can be just for fun.","Living on margin in 2022 [HCOL, tech]"

With standard deductions, this puts my federally taxable income at around 32.5k.

Instead of contributing all 22.5k into my employers traditional 401k, should I do more like 11k traditional and 11.5k roth? This would still keep me at the 12% bracket, pay an extra 12% taxes on the 11.5k roth contributions, and get the tax free withdrawals later on?

* I've filled emergency funds only to drain them **DAYS** later for fix-and-flip rehab costs.

I could go on...

My problem has always been that there is just too much contrasting advice when it comes to personal finance, and every time I learned something new, my shiny object syndrome would kick in, and send me off in a new direction.

Being the engineer that I am, I decided it was time to create **MY OWN** framework. One that would combine Dave Ramsey's ""Baby Steps"" with Robert Kiyosaki's ""Cashflow"" board game.

This framework has gone through several iterations to satisfy:

* The **entrepreneur** in me, who understands that the further you live below your means, the faster you can expand your income.
* The **husband** in me, who knows that quality of life is sometimes more important than the cost of living.
* The **investor** in me, who knows that for every dollar sitting in our bank account, we are losing not only to inflation but also to the opportunity cost of not putting our money to work.
* The **father** in me, who knows that having little to no cash in our bank account puts my family at unnecessary risk and adds stress where it otherwise is not needed.

I've created The Bombproof Budget framework over several years to address the multiple contradictions I've experienced when managing my family's finances.

Here are some benefits that I believe my framework provides:

* Following action steps forces us to take consistent action without deviating from the original goal.
* Automatic investment in personal development stimulates income growth.
* How money flows for discretionary spending puts a rev limiter on my family's lifestyle creep.
* Zero-Based budgeting forces us to visualize our sacrifices when discussing with my wife what to spend our money on next.
* Focusing on cash flow allows us to visualize how close we are to achieving financial freedom.

An Overview

Before you get to the action steps, you first need to understand the components that make up The Bombproof Budget. It will consist of the zero-based budgeting method, ten category groups, runway, overage funds, and action steps that guide decision-making.

The Zero-Based Budgeting Method

The Zero-Based budgeting method means that I give every dollar a job. Any good entrepreneur knows that we need to make money work for us, instead of allowing ourselves to work for money.

This method is a habit that requires repetition. We still don't always get it right, but we certainly get better with the more reps we put in. My wife and I sit down for 15 minutes daily to process new transactions and see what's left in each spending category.

Category Groups

These are the category groups that house the sub-categories which we use to track both income and spending:

🛐 **GIVING** (Builds Character)  
🧾 **TAXES** (Income Withholdings)  
🏠 **NECESSITY** (Cost of Living)  
🛡️ **SECURITY** (Safety of Mind)  
😅 **UNPLANNED** (Shit I Didn't Think About)  
💸 **CONSUMER** **DEBT** (Ouch, My Cashflow)  
🌱 **DEVELOPMENT** (Grow Our Income)  
🎉 **LIFESTYLE** (Fun &amp; Adventure)  
⚔️ **WAR** **CHEST** (Business &amp; Investments)   &lt; – – OOOOooooo what's this???  
⚖️ **LOANS** (Bridge Loans &amp; Notes)

🛐 **GIVING** (Builds Character)It accounts for the 10% of my income I set aside for giving. Giving has developed into a habit that I believe has shaped how I conduct my business into leading with service and integrity.

🧾 **TAXES** (Income Withholdings)Accounts for the 30% of my income that I deduct for Uncle Sam, but once I've already set it aside, I do everything within my power to reduce the amount I spend.

**🏠 NECESSITY** (Cost of Living)Accounts for the expenses that make up my family's monthly cost of living. This category puts food on the table, keeps us warm, provides modern necessities, and gets us to where we need to go. Nothing more.

**🛡️ SECURITY** (Safety of Mind)Accounts for everything that protects my family when shit goes wrong. This covers everything from insurance payments to deductibles, advisory fees, healthcare, and our emergency fund.

**😅 UNPLANNED** (Shit I Didn't Think About)Accounts for the 5% of my spending added to the budget for all less frequent expenses - the ones we either forgot about or never planned for in the first place.

**💸 CONSUMER** **DEBT** (Ouch, My Cashflow)Accounts for every liability that's not tied to an income-producing asset (except for our home). I'm a cash flow investor, and the lower I can make my monthly expenses, the higher my monthly cash flow becomes. This means getting aggressive with consumer debt.

🌱 **DEVELOPMENT** (Grow Our Income)Accounts for 10% of my monthly income that I spend on personal development, which leads directly to income growth. Because the  10% allows this category to grow as my budget increases, it allows my spending to scale as my income scales. Early on, I would buy $20 books, then $500 certifications, pretty soon I'm joining $5,000 mastermind groups, and setting my sights on hiring a $25k performance coach! (all of which provide WAY more value than a $100k college degree btw...)

🎉 **LIFESTYLE** (Fun &amp; Adventure)It accounts for 10% of my monthly income that I set aside for lifestyle. This is where we fund **ALL** of our discretionary spending. From date nights to vacations, new laptops, and that pet chameleon my wife's been eyeballing for a while now 🙄. As with the development category above, our lifestyle scales with our income. Vacations might be road trips for now, but in a few years, we'll be flying 1st class and staying at the Four Seasons.

⚔️ **WAR** **CHEST** (Business &amp; Investments)This is where **ALL** of our cash flow ends up. The war chest then becomes a resource for my deal-making strategies. When I look to buy an asset, I only underwrite deals that I could buy with the funds that are in my war chest. This prevents me from becoming the buyer that backs out of a deal because I couldn't secure funding. **LET ME BE CLEAR**. If I find a deal that I like, I do everything within my power **NOT** to touch my war chest. (This category deserves a deep dive all on its own.)

⚖️ **LOANS** (Bridge Loans &amp; Notes)Accounts for all money I loan to any of my ventures which I plan on eventually getting back. The money used is borrowed from the war chest fund and tracked here.

Runway

Our runway is comprised of these four categories:🏠 **NECESSITY** (Cost of Living)🛡️ **SECURITY** (Safety of Mind)😅 **UNPLANNED** (Shit I Didn't Think About)💸 **CONSUMER** **DEBT** (Ouch, My Cashflow)

We determine first our 🏠 **NECESSITY**, 🛡️ **SECURITY**, and 💸 **CONSUMERDEBT**. Once we have that number, we multiply it by 5%, which becomes our monthly 😅 **UNPLANNED** contribution.

Then we add all 4 of these categories up, which equals one month of runway.

Overage Funds

Overage funds are an excellent way to simplify our numbers while adding just a little padding for the variable expenses. I like to round up to the nearest hundred in each category group.

For example, on average, my 🏠 **NECESSITY** category adds up to $2,940.19/mo.  I want to add an overage fund of $59.81 so that my category reflects a nice round of $3,000/mo.

Action Steps

**STEP ONE: Deduct Withholdings**  
As my money flows in, it doesn't matter if it's daily, monthly, or quarterly; I take 10% off the top before doing anything else. Next, I set 30% aside for my tax withholdings. If I successfully reduce my taxable income for the year, all excess money is moved into my war chest.

**STEP TWO: Fund the Next 3 Months of Runway**  
Since I don't receive w2 income, I like to keep at least three months of runway funded for the months ahead. In this way, I am reassured that I have time between capital events before worrying about picking up some part-time income to fill in the gaps. If it is January, and I have February through March funded, then I will send any new income to STEP THREE, but the moment February 1st rolls around, all new income needs to be redirected to funding April's runway before allowing the transition to STEP THREE once more.

**STEP THREE: Pay Off ALL Consumer Debt**  
I like to get LEAN on my expenses. My goal is to become financially independent, not to drive a nicer car or live in a bigger house (those will come later). It's much easier to quit your job if you only need $4k of passive income instead of $10k. Not to mention how fast that additional cash flow accelerates wealth building.

**STEP FOUR: Invest 20% into Development (10%) &amp; Lifestyle (10%)**  
Now that I've cut the fat and my expenses are as low as I can make them, I begin to fund our personal development. We take 10% of our income, which is 5% for me and 5% for my wife, and we invest it in books, courses, subscriptions, etc. We also reward our hard work by funding various trips, date nights, outfits, home renovations, etc. with the 10% that we take out of our income for lifestyle.

**STEP FIVE: Save 3 Months of Expenses in a Fully Funded Emergency Fund**  
The emergency fund is separate from the three months of runway in that we hope never to touch it. It exists purely to provide a buffer against the unknown. Let's say an unexpected event prompts us to spend $10k. We could take care of the emergency without reducing any of the time we have provided by our runway.

**STEP SIX: Commit All Remaining Cashflow to the War Chest**  
With three months of runway, a fully funded emergency fund, and new tactics gained through personal development, I feel as though I have an unfair advantage when it comes to finding and negotiating deals. I'm not in a rush to risk buying a bad deal, I can afford to close even if my creative financing falls through, and I'm protected against any unforeseen obstacles that may arise at home. What's more, is that my deals get bigger and bigger, but my expenses stay the same.

His - 401k: $192 // Ind. Brok: $304k // Roth IRA: $32k // Checking: $21k // HSA: $10k = $559k

Total Combined NW: $1.03M

In 2022, I invested $122k and my fiancé invested ~100k. So let’s just say we invested over $200k combined.

I am 30 years old, work in marketing, and now earn $291k total comp ($200k base, $82k cash bonus, $9k company stock). My fiancé is 34 and earns $260k per year. We split expenses 50/50, don’t own a house or a car, and don’t want kids.

We initially reached millionaire status over the summer and celebrated by drinking a cheap bottle of wine. We were on cloud nine for about a week and then returned to our baseline level of happiness. In terms of our RE number, we still haven’t landed on a number we can both agree on. He still wants to aim for $10M to help ease the feeling of uncertainty during market fluctuations. For instance, if the market drops 50%, we wouldn’t have to change our lifestyle. But I would argue we could achieve the same between a $3M-$5M NW. We anticipate spending up to $120k/year in retirement (this includes healthcare and increased vacation spend) so at a min we’d need $3M to live an upgraded version of our current lifestyle. I simply don’t want to work longer than I need to. At the end of the day, I think this is a good problem to have. I know we’ll eventually reach a compromise.

From a career standpoint, you may have noticed that I switched jobs. Well, I finally made it to big tech and negotiated hard for my compensation package. The job’s fine. Not as exciting as my last role, but I’m learning some interesting things. One of my goals was to work at a tech company. Now that I've achieved it, I’m not sure what I want to do next with my career. As our NW grows, I no longer care about moving up the corporate ladder. I’ve been more interested in my creative hobbies, travel plans, and things we can start doing now before reaching FI (e.g., videography, photography, exercise more, travel more, etc.). I guess I sense our corporate careers are nearing an end as we get closer to FI. I'm slowing down on the corporate hamster wheel and I don’t hate it.

As mentioned earlier, I’m newly engaged and can’t wait to marry the love of my life. We don’t care much for jewelry so I asked for a cheaper gem instead of a diamond ring. He wants a rubber ring. Our thinking is that if we lose them, they can easily be replaced without breaking the bank. Also, the thought of my fiancé spending thousands on a ring made me feel queasy so we agreed to spend more on our honeymoon. We haven’t picked a date yet, but plan to marry in 2024. We may have a small dinner party (no wedding) after we elope with no more than 20 relatives. Once we leave corporate America, we plan to slow travel around the world while pursuing our hobbies in more depth.

No one in our family knows about our millionaire status. They know that we invest and are interested in financial independence, but no one has expressed particular interest. I prefer it this way as I’ve read stories of relationships changing for the worse after a person’s wealth is revealed. Otherwise, I’ve been setting healthy boundaries with my family (particularly my emotionally unstable mother) and I think I’m mentally better for it. While I’ll never forget my troubled past, I’m in a much better place mentally, emotionally, and financially. I refuse to let that define me for the rest of my life. I’ve healed and am ready to live my best life with my soon-to-be husband.

Things are still stable on the mental front. I’ve reached a point where I couldn’t care less if I get laid off. I have no doubt that I will be able to find another job eventually. Who knows, maybe I’ll double down on one of my hobbies instead and see where it takes me. This mindset makes me feel incredibly powerful as if we’ve already reached FI.

I’m still cycling indoors 3-4x per week and lifting weights 2x per week. I plan to continue doing this, if not more, in retirement.

While no one knows what the future holds, I expect there to be some form of a recession coming. I may get laid off and that would be totally fine because I have enough invested/saved to weather the storm for multiple years and have full confidence in my ability to eventually find another job. It also helps having a partner who works too.

Anyway, here are some lessons we learned that you may want to keep in mind and/or apply to your FI journey:

• Celebrate every NW milestone. You’ve earned it

• Your past does not define you or your future

• The closer you get to FI, the less f*cks you’ll give

• Explore hobbies and practice healthy habits before reaching FI (ideally 2-3 years beforehand)

Remember, none our progress happened overnight. It took a lot of luck and consistency to help us reach this point. However, I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge the privilege we now have as adults. That’s not lost on us and we (especially myself) are learning how to navigate that.

I also found out my aunt's daughter (my cousin) has received an heirloom ring (with rubies, diamonds...etc) from my grandmother, money to buy more land, a laptop...etc. and since she has kids my grandmother flies her out to visits and spends money on them. And who knows what else! 

I have received nothing from my grandmother and it's awkward as I am not sure how best to approach it. I wish my dad would talk w/ my aunt and grandmother and figure out a way to better manage who gets what. They all have kids so they see her more often and I think there is favoritism. I am going to visit her in a few months and am wondering how I can best handle this situation? I never even got a christmas card or anything from her. She could easily send all of her grandchildren a few hundred to a thousand dollars a year for christmas, because she also is legally required to spend a certain amount of money per year because of her age apparently. She has a lot of money, it would be nice to receive some of it from her, because I know my aunt's side is getting stuff as well. I also would love some heirloom jewelry to pass down and remember her by. 

I think mostly my dad and aunt will get her inheritance, but while she is alive and spending money on others and has lots of money to spend, I wish it was more fairly managed. 

Any help or advice is appreciated!",How to ask for some inheritance?

Both graphs made with Sankeymatic --&gt; [https://imgur.com/a/V3pPL2t](https://imgur.com/a/V3pPL2t)

I (34M) am a Nurse Anesthetist out of school for two years now. I have a young child and am with 36F SAHM spouse. We have zero student/car/credit card  debt. Credit card is paid in full every month. We have a house loan which is our only debt. My gross income this  year was about 220k. My income is projected to be 260-270k in 2023. 

Some notes -  

I consider the way we live to be rather modest. And even though I got a  substantial pay raise a couple years go, we largely live the same way we  did five years ago when I was an RN making 50k per year, with the  exception that we now buy higher quality food and will travel a bit  more. What we don’t spend on cost of living, as you can see, gets  invested. Index fund of choice is VTSAX. We still meal prep for my five work meals per week, and we both drive 20 year old reliable vehicles, kid is in public school. 

At this rate I'm thinking we will hit financial independence in around 6-7 years at which point I plan to cut back on work a little bit and travel more. Maybe I'll branch out and open a pizzeria/pinball joint. Don't know. I'm thinking our number needs to be roughly 1 million to 1.2 million, but I also want to pay our house completely off so that 18 grand is freed up, lowering annual expenditures. I think that this will be similar to how it was when I was in grad school paying tuition with knowing the final cost number. The closer we get to it, the more exact we'll be able to pinpoint what it will be. In any case, it does not change what we're doing now. 

Our expenses this year were 76k, but we also had about 5 grand in car expenses that are not typical in a given year. We had just been abusing the vehicles while I was in school. Our shopping expenses could be cut some too. With taking the mortgage out would put us around 50k per year which would be 1.25 million. But I'd probably still work some and even if I were to work just 2-3 months a year, it would cover 100% of those living expenses with my salary. That's the tentative plan anyway. We are happy now, and are squarely in the boring middle part of our journey.

* 2020: $26,539 / - $28,074.16
* 2021: $33,635 / -$11,765.71
* 2022: $81,077.65 / $31,181.83

 GENERAL 

* 27m, single, no kids
* I live in rural WV so yes, my rent and utilities combine to only about \~$700/month
* I don't budget but I do write down every penny I spend and then take about 30 minutes at the end of each month combining it into a few charts on google sheets, I don't feel I spend too much that warrants a real budget. I'm pretty naturally frugal. I track NW monthly in these charts as well.
* I paid off my car this year!! Maxed 403b, Roth IRA, I-bonds. This is the first year I have ever been close to maxing these retirement accounts available to me and I am stoked. Next year I get an HSA so that's to be added to the list!
* in 2020 as I began investing, I learned a harsh lesson about single stocks. Invested about $6000 into my Roth IRA, thinking I could make some tax-free gains. In the beginning, I was up about $5000 in a few weeks, and thought this was great! I'm the smartest! Unfortunately I was caught bag-holding and that +$5000 quickly became -$5000. Learned a great deal from that, with a non-tax-harvestable $5000 loss. Now we are index fund gang for life.

&amp;#x200B;

 HISTORY and INCOME

* Divorced parents and 3 other siblings. Attempted to join the military out of high-school but could not do to medical issues. Mom stayed at home, dad construction. Not poor, but close. A fond memory I recall is ""loaning"" my dad $500 I got for my 13th birthday party ""or we wouldn't be able to go to vacation for the 2nd year in a row and it would be my fault."" Never saw that money back, who'da thunk! Parents had their addictions and dad was in-and-out of jail occasionally in my teens. Better now and have a good relationship, but watching my parents grow up very much cemented the idea that I was going to do better. Parents have 0 savings and I am still asked to loan them money at least monthly. I will give my (possible, future) kids better.
* 2018 - Graduated college Summer of '18 with a Bachelor's, unfortunately a mostly useless degree without going on further into a masters/etc. First and only child to go to/graduate college so far. Mom remarried in my first year of college to a gentleman making about 100k which unfortunately counted towards my FAFSA and I wasn't eligible for much aid, despite not getting assistance from my step-dad financially, which I wouldn't expect! I worked part time throughout school to pay what I could/rent and graduated with about 55k in student loans. Moved to WV for a change in scenery and to start work. Made about $15/hour for the final few months, lived with a roommate.
* 2019 - In the same position, continued to work for the whole year with no change, maybe 45-50 hours a week on average.
* 2020 - Decided $15/hour wasn't enough with a Bachelor's and 50k student debt. Found a year-long program that would increase my income to about 55k base. Worked about 30hours/week while in school 40hours/week for the program. 
* 2021 - Graduated mid '21 from the program, moved about an hour or so for the new job. $27/hour. Nice, nearly doubled my income! First paycheck hit and I remember it being more than I would make working 20 hours of overtime on previous job. Felt so good! Was fast approaching $0 NW and excited.
* 2022 - Came off probationary period for work, proved I could do what I needed and became independent in work. Raise to base $29/hour. Solid amount of overtime available. On call periodically, I pick it up frequently from coworkers because I have the time to work now. I probably average 50hours/week currently and 10 on call/week!

FIRE TARGET and PLANS:

I haven't built the life I want to live yet. I'm considering moving to a HCOL state where rent runs about $1200/month and remaining around 70-80k/pay. This will be a pay-cut unless I can find a job that offers more income, but right now I'm pretty bored living where I am. I live about an hour from closest friends and two hours from family. This move would put me squarely in the middle of a dozen friends, and I'm considering it as a big QOL improvement. My current goal FIRE amount is $1.5mm. This may change when/if I have kids.

294,0,"So here is what I have/will have in 2023 in addition to the $20k:
- Emergency fund for 6-8 months 

- Maxed Roth IRA
- Maxed HSA (single)
- 401k up to match

- $20k in I-Bonds (12months; not funded for 2023) 
- $50k in HYSA (3.3% atm)
- $8k checking

Debts:
- *$50k student loans (federal ~6.3% avg)*
- $20k auto loan 

Assume my pay for 2023 is enough to pay for my monthly expenses + contribute to the tax-deferred retirements. That’s it. 
Also assume the E-fund is NOT at play (can’t touch it unless I truly need it). 

The specific number is because I had to buy a new car and the auto loan was for $19800 at 5.25% for 60 months. ($377/month for $2750 in total interest over 60 months) 

1. I need to figure out if and when I should just pay off the auto loan with the cash I have. 

2. Until I should pay off the auto loan, where should I keep this money? Ideally I’d like to use that money to at least break even on the interest 

3. The reason I have cash in HYSA is because I plan to pay off my student loans when the time comes. Currently deferred/no interest accruing or payments required until June. 
- It appears with the auto loan now I won’t be able to fully pay off the student loans but there’s about $10k that’s at 3.5% and $20k at &gt;6.5%; the rest are in between. 

Some ideas i have had includes leaving the money in the HYSA, possible “churning” (w/ bank &amp; CC promos) to help minimize the interest accrued, and sticking bits into I-bonds as the initial $20k is almost at &gt;1 year (it’s 20k because I gave 10k to my mom to open for me).",Help brother maximize $19800

313,0,"Retirement planning is based on having a SWR that meets your expenses.  I have never had a budget and had always ballparked my expenses at about 50K.  That made my retirement projections shaky.   I figured I needed an accurate picture of my spending so I could plan my retirement better.  This year I did an experiment and I wrote down every penny I spent, all year, using a google spreadsheet on my phone.   Here is what I learned.

I live in a MCOL city on the East Coast in a 3BR/2.5Ba Single Family home.  I had been projecting an annual spend of about 50K in retirement.  I ended up spending more than that.   

2022 Total: 59250.93.  

High (November): 8486.55

Low (December): 2486.86.  

Average: 4960.08. 

Clearly I spent more than my projected 50K, so that's good to know.  That will inform my baseline SWR for year one of retirement.  My future calculations will use a SWR of 60K.

However, why I ended up spending more than 50K this year was interesting. 

An unexpected consequence of tracking every penny was that I realized that I was spending less than I should.  Knowing this year's spending would affect my income in retirement made me spend more, not less.  I wanted an accurate cost of what I consider living well.  So, that 59K I spent included not only the minimum expenses, but also 16K of intermittent purchases and house expenses that come up:

two guitars (5000)

one week trip in the summer (1500) 

a new laptop (1000) 

a new dishwasher (700)

a new fridge (1200)

copay for braces for a kid (2600)

three weeks in Paris (about 4000).  

Some of that, like the braces and the dishwasher are expenses that could not be easily avoided, but everything else was extra, and represented to me the cost of living well.  So I now know that 60K feels like living well, and also that the minimum I could survive on in a year I needed to tighten my belt is more like 45K.  It wouldn't be living well, but in a market downturn, I could spend less if I needed to.

So for me at least, once I was recording every penny spent, I realized I could spend more and meet my savings goals.  This year I made the most I'd ever made and also saved the most I've ever saved.  I made 194K.   I maxed out my 403b/IRA/SEP IRA/457b/401a, made mandatory pension contributions and put a large chunk into my taxable brokerage.  In total, I saved 110,345, for a savings rate of 57%.  I also received an inheritance of 58K and was able to invest another 47K of college money that my kid didn't need because she got a scholarship, so the total I put into investments this year was 215,345.  

I see no need to continue recording every penny spent this year.  In fact, I just got curly fries and milkshakes from Arby's and didn't write down how much it cost.  Yay!

But writing down every penny spent in 2023 not only gave me an idea of what a very comfortable SWR would be in retirement, it taught me I could spent a bit more and still make my goals.  

So, do you record all of your spending?  If not, I encourage you to try it for a while.  What you learn might surprise you.",What I learned from recording every penny spent in 2022

**INTRO**

Are  you tired of living paycheck to paycheck and ready to take control of  your personal finances? Then it's time to create a smart personal  finance plan that will help you save and reach your financial goals!  Read on to learn how you can craft a budget, build your savings, and  create a plan for long-term success!

**METHOD**

Creating  a smart personal finance plan is an important step in taking control of  your financial life. It will help you set goals, stay organized, and  track your progress. With the right plan in place, you can make better  financial decisions that will put you on the path to financial success.

In  this blog, we will discuss how to create a smart personal finance plan  that will help you reach your financial goals. We will cover topics such  as setting financial goals, budgeting, tracking your spending, and  investing for the future.

Setting Financial Goals

The  first step in creating your personal finance plan is to set financial  goals. These goals should be realistic, measurable, and achievable. When  setting financial goals, it is important to consider both short-term  and long-term goals. Short-term goals are typically those that can be  achieved within the next year. Examples of short-term goals could  include paying off a credit card balance in full, increasing your  savings rate, or reducing your spending. Long-term goals are those that  you hope to achieve in the future, such as retirement planning or buying  a house.

When setting financial  goals, it is important to consider both your current financial situation  and your long-term goals. Consider the following questions when setting  your financial goals:

• What do I want to accomplish financially?

• What are my financial priorities?

• What resources do I have available to reach my financial goals?

Once you have identified your financial goals, you can begin to develop a plan to achieve them.

Budgeting

Budgeting  is an essential tool for achieving your financial goals. It allows you  to track your income and expenses, and make sure you are spending within  your means. When creating a budget, it is important to consider your  current income, expenses, and financial goals.

Start  by listing all of your income sources and all of your expenses. Be sure  to include both fixed and variable expenses, such as rent or mortgage  payments, utilities, groceries, and entertainment. Once you have a clear  picture of your income and expenses, you can begin to create a budget.

When  creating a budget, it is important to make sure you are living within  your means. This means that you should not be spending more than you  earn. If you find that you are spending more than you earn, you may need  to make some adjustments to your budget. Consider reducing your  spending, increasing your income, or finding ways to save money.

Tracking Your Spending

Tracking  your spending is an important part of managing your finances. It helps  you identify where your money is going and make adjustments to stay on  track. There are a variety of tools and apps available to help you track  your spending.

First, create a  list of all of your expenses, including fixed and variable expenses.  This will give you an idea of where your money is going each month.  Then, use budgeting apps or online banking services to track your  spending. These tools can help you visualize your spending and identify  areas where you can make adjustments.

Investing for the Future

Investing  for the future is an important part of any personal finance plan.  Investing can help you reach your long-term financial goals and build  wealth over time. Investing is more than just buying stocks and bonds.  It includes a variety of strategies, such as saving for retirement,  starting an emergency fund, or investing in real estate.

When  investing for the future, it is important to consider both your risk  tolerance and time horizon. Your risk tolerance is the amount of risk  you are willing to take when investing. Your time horizon is the amount  of time you plan to invest for. These factors will help you determine  the best investment strategies for your personal financial plan.

Final Thoughts

Creating  a smart personal finance plan is an important step in taking control of  your financial life. By setting realistic goals, budgeting, tracking  your spending, and investing for the future, you can make better  financial decisions and achieve long-term financial success. With the  right plan in place, you can take control of your financial future.

**INTERESTING FACTS**

When  it comes to personal finance, it is important to understand the  different types of investments available. Investing in stocks and bonds  is one way to build wealth over time, but there are other investments  that can be a part of a smart personal finance plan. Here are some other  investments to consider:

• Real  Estate: Investing in real estate can be a great way to build wealth. It  can also provide a steady stream of income in the form of rental  payments.

• Mutual Funds: Mutual  funds are a type of investment that pools money from multiple investors.  They are professionally managed and can provide a diversified  portfolio.

• Exchange Traded Funds  (ETFs): ETFs are a type of investment that tracks a specific index or  market. They are typically more affordable than mutual funds and provide  investors with higher returns.

• Commodities: Investing in commodities such as gold, oil, or other metals can be a great way to hedge against inflation.

•  Cryptocurrency: Cryptocurrency is a digital asset that uses encryption  technology to secure transactions. Investing in cryptocurrency can be a  great way to diversify your investments and hedge against market  volatility.

When investing, it is  important to consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. It is also  important to understand the different types of investments so that you  can make the best decisions for your personal finance plan.

Another  important part of personal finance is insurance. Insurance can help  protect you from financial losses due to unexpected circumstances, such  as a job loss or medical bills. There are a variety of insurance  policies available, such as auto, health, life, and homeowners  insurance. It is important to understand the different types of  insurance and how they can help protect you and your family.

Finally,  it is important to understand the different types of banking products  available. These can include savings accounts, checking accounts, and  certificates of deposit (CDs). Different banks will offer different  rates and terms, so it is important to shop around and compare options.

By  understanding the different types of investments, insurance, and  banking products available, you can make better financial decisions and  create a smarter personal finance plan. With the right plan in place,  you can achieve your financial goals and secure your financial future.

**CALL TO ACTION**

Take  action now to create a smart personal finance plan! Start by setting a  goal, like saving for a vacation or paying off debt, and then break it  down into smaller goals. Make a budget and track your spending to stay  on top of your finances. Use free budgeting tools and apps to help you  stay organized and on track with your financial goals. Finally, make  sure to review your plan regularly and make adjustments as needed. With  the right plan in place, you can take control of your finances and make  your financial dreams a reality.

318,0,"Note: the purpose of this post is *not* to criticize folks for their purchasing decisions, only to describe a mentality that was once foreign to me.

I've realized the reason so many of my coworkers feel poor is their life expectations are different than mine.

I come from a frugal family and was elated when I began making \~$100k/yr. I regularly found my coworkers talk about how they couldn't afford basic things. Many of them had no NW despite working their $100k+/yr job for over a decade. At the time I wondered, ""How is that possible?"" I genuinely couldn't spend that much money if I tried.

I've realized its because of their expectations in life: maybe private school for all their kids, a big home in their favorite location, nice cars or expensive wine. And each item my coworkers added to their list of life expectations negatively affected their outlook on their personal finances.

Of course, that's not to say life expectations are bad. Everyone would argue some expectations in life (food, water) are justified and others are not ($1bn McMansion and a private island).

322,0,"Making money is important to me, but I don't need 200K/year. I do however want a safe job with good work life balance and decent pay. I want to be able to spend a decent amount of my life making friendships and spending time with friends.

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

Which path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?

340,0,"So I’m currently 17 years old, and I was recently accepted into a university early decision. I looked onto my college’s website, and I found out that my tuition will be about $80k a year (including housing + meals), and I assume my family will spend money to bring me home when school is out. I had several conversations with my mother about how exactly I will pay for school, and she said that the majority of my tuition will be payed through a trust fund that my father left me before he passed away.
For most of my life, I chose not to ask my mother about the trust because I always heard her complain about how the long court battle she had trying to uphold the clause of her divorce agreement saying that if either she or my dad were to pass away before I was 18, they would leave all their money to me, but my father instead tried to leave *some* money to his friends and establish his lawyer friend as my trustee. Apparently, the fight got pretty nasty, and even though my mother was named a trustee by a judge later on, my dad’s lawyer friend used money from my trust fund to pay for his defense in the lawsuit. My mom also objected to paying someone to manage my stocks and bonds while we have family who are very successful hedge fund workers.
After sitting down with my mom, I discovered that my trust fund is currently worth about $1.4 million in various stocks and bonds. The fund was set up about 3-4 years ago at around $1.1 million, and it has paid my $40-45k tuition at private school since then, and I guess it makes sense that its still gaining money if the annual return for this year was about 5.3% or $72k. I did see that the fund was worth about $1.8 million a year ago, but my hedge fund friend explained that some stocks have gone down in the past year, and they will for a bit in the future. The fund, however, is still where it was 2 years ago, and that’s after my mom took out $150-$200k to pay for expenses.
My real question is what should I expect the next “changes” to my trust to look like, because even though my mother told me it will dissolve and ownership will be mine at around age 23, the trust was set up entirely for EDUCATION. Based on the way my mom talked about it, she didn’t expect me to have much of anything left by the time I finish college (and possibly grad school) since my trust has fluctuated a bit. I still thought that if I can generate $72k a year from the trust, and combine it with the $30-40k from my Mom’s 529, I wouldn’t see much of a change compared to now, and I could have $1 million by the time I’m 23. 
I just want to know how I can make the best investment in my education while preparing for my future, and having some sort of an estimate would be nice.",Paying for my education through a trust fund

356,0," This will be cross posted in a few FIRE related reddits, so if you see it somewhere else, nothing is different. 

I always begin these updates with the same disclaimer that I don't have a specific FIRE date since I was self employed before retirement and slowly dissolved my business over time and started investing in real estate. I use the 2010 time frame for reference because it is around the time I hired a property manager (thus leaving me zero active work to do unless I choose), but it certainly isn't exact.

This isn't meant as a comparison to anyone else. This is strictly provided to the FIRE community because I know I would have liked to have seen real world example of how people handle their finances when I was trying to figure all this out many years ago. Another reason I post these is to show there is more than one way to do FIRE. I was able to accomplish this without ever making a high income during my working years. I simply lived very frugally and put the money I saved into individual stocks (hey, it was 80s - 90s...I didn't know better and stock investing was a completely different animal back then) and then converted that to buying rental properties in a low cost of living area in the 2000s.

Quick stats: I'm 57, single, no kid's, about 12 years post FIRE.

**WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE MY LAST UPDATE**

Last update had some major changes, but not so much this time other than a few book keeping notes to tidy up some math. 

Had just bought a new car in the last update, a  2022 Hybrid Elantra, and had planned to pay it off in cash after getting the financing rebate. Right before the payoff I found out a roof needed repair and I wasn't going to be able to cash flow it without a margin loan against my stock that would be much higher than the car loan at 2.75%, so I decided to keep it. 4 roofs later, I still have the loan, lol. The car IS so far doing as expected and getting me over the 60mpg I planned. The gas savings combined with the 10 year bumper to bumper warranty SHOULD result in an overall savings vs. gas and repairs to my previous drivers. Most of those are collector cars, so I'll be selling them off to help pay the expense of the new car. Anyway, that is about $650 per month on a 4 year loan. So that will be reflected in my financials now. 

The house cleaner mentioned previously moved away...and I haven't bothered to replace her.

I've continued to grow the real estate business, with several new projects now in the works keeping my team busy...while I sit around and enjoy the retired life, lol. In fairness, I do look at potential houses in person and discuss what I want done with my team, but after that I rarely have any hands on involvement outside of the rare big picture decision.

**INCOME**

Net income for the year from all income streams after all expenses is right at $143,000 This is mostly rental income with some dividends (about $15,000) thrown in. 

**GROWTH AND NET WORTH**

My growth in my investments so far this year. Keep in mind this numbers reflect the sharp downturn in the markets.

Total invested this year $132,000. (Yes, that left me $11,000 to live on. That will be addressed below)

Because I hold some long term leverage in stocks, it was pretty brutal this year, and I lost a total of just shy of $275,000 in the stock market. Leaving me with a stock balance of right at $364,000. Luckily my other investments did well and continued to grow. 

Fundrise account grew about $8200 in appreciation for a return of right at 9.3% and leaving a balance of right at $109,000 (I know that math looks strange, but I invested $24K throughout the year)...and that should get better at the final adjustments are not yet in for the last quarter. 

My real estate (rentals) is very difficult to estimate since I have partners on some of the houses and some I own outright. Not to mention it isn't a liquid asset. I usually just judge it by the income it produces...that being said it does have a value that adds to my net worth. I'll be conservative and say my real estate portfolio is worth $2M - $2.5M. I do not hold debt on the portfolio. Everything is owned outright without loans of any sort. This includes some sharp increases in property values over the past couple of years. I don't think it has changed substantially since the last update. 

My personal property (the house and 10 acres of land I live on) is worth about $450k - $500k...again as a conservative estimate. A house similar to mine, but in my opinion not quite as appealing, recently sold for over $750,000.

I have misc. accounts totaling around $45K...this is a small Acorn account, another stock account I use for experiments in investing, and my liquid accounts that I use for personal and business expenses. I keep more in a ""cash"" bank account than most because I need to cover business expenses. I try to keep around $20K in there, but it will fluctuate greatly throughout the month to as low as $7 or 8K, to sometimes as high as $30k. I currently have another $4k in a money market fund. I have this for quick liquidity when needed. This also varies greatly and will be as high as $50K at times.

Not going to bother with my cars and other misc. on this update. This brings my total net worth as of this update to around $3,000,000 (using the conservative estimates above)- $3,500,000. So, stocks are down since last update, real estate is about even, so when you account for the money invested my net worth is down slightly since the last update, but not substantially.

**EXPENSES**

I spent a total average of $672 per month on all non business related expenses in the first half of the year. The car about doubled it  in the last half of the year. This came in over my previous goal of $10K per year with total spent on typical stuff at $11,245. In late October I was hiking near Eureka Springs, AR and found a cat quite literally on her death bed. Skin and bones...too weak to even really move. So I  decided to try to save her if I could. Right now she is still alive, and has about $3000 in vet bills and counting. So....that brings my total spent this year to $14,245 and far exceeds my non investment spending in previous years of retirement. 

These numbers are updated to reflect the current expenses, even though these are some fairly recent changes.

Phone/Internet $25 (Visible wireless with unlimited hotspot for internet)

Insurance on my cars $125 (3 cars liability only, 1 full coverage)

Food/groceries $100 (I've done some detailed food budget breakdowns if you're curious how I keep this so low)

Electric $125 - $150 (average throughout the year/ all electric house)

I have my own well and septic tank, so no bills for water, sewerage, and trash.

Gas for cars $25 - $50. I spent quite a bit more on gas in the last few months before buying the hybrid, so my gas budget went up quite a bit. It was about $100 - $150 before buying the hybrid. This is mainly due to looking at more houses for the business, semi local trips for hiking/and or entertainment. (everything within 100 miles, but it does add up)

Entertainment $100. I hate to give this it's own line in the budget, but I do sometimes spend on entertainment, so although this is no way a true reflection of what I spent last year, I am including it because everyone asks, lol. Most of my entertainment ends up being ""free"" or nearly free other than the gas it takes to go places. Last year my out of pocket on entertainment was probably about $300 for a season pass to Silver Dollar City, and several cave tours with a friend from out of town. Other than that it was mostly gas to get to some fun hiking spots. 

Health Insurance is a free (for now) catastrophic plan. Thanks to all my real estate deductions I get to write off most of my income, leaving me just able to qualify for the absolute worst plan available in my state for free. Of course, if one little thing goes wrong at tax time and I step over the threshold at the end of the year, that could change and I'll be left paying for a plan I've never used.

I think next year I'll be looking at about $15,000 goal for total spent if I don't take on another cat on her deathbed...or if this one doesn't cost me another $5k. 

I think that covers where things are now.

**WHY DON'T I SPEND MORE?**

I started including this section because I was asked about it so much. Same as last update, so nothing new here.

I get asked this a lot. Why am I still trying to accumulate wealth 10 + years after I retired? Well, I'm still relatively young, and I have some big future goals that includes a large animal sanctuary with its own vet clinic and vegan restaurant. Even though I already have about 40 acres lined up for it, it is going to take a long time to get all the infrastructure in place. It might be 5 -10 years before it actually opens. I'm hoping to build as much as I can in the meantime.

I'm also just frugal by nature. Most of the stuff I enjoy is free or nearly free. Hiking trails, video games, TV, movies, diving down rabbit holes of whatever interest me at the time, etc. Some of my hobbies even make me money. I've managed to buy cars that appreciate. I happen to be a decent poker player. My watches have done really well...same with my art collection.

I don't live like a pauper. I live alone in a 4000 sq ft Mid Century house built into a cliff overlooking a river and beautiful valley with an indoor pool...so don't think my frugality always comes at the cost of the finer things. It is true until I recently bought my dream house I lived in a very modest house most people wouldn't associate with a millionaire (that house now rents for $750 a month), but I was patient and wanted to find the perfect house before I bothered to move. As I briefly mentioned before I have nice things like collector cars, art, watches, etc....I just try to spend as little as possible on depreciating assets or things like food. I appreciate good food, but being vegan makes it hard to eat out in my area. That is probably an understatement. There are maybe a handful of places I can eat at all (at least with more than salad as an option), and most of those only have one or two items on the menu I can eat. So I'd rather prepare great meals at home from cheap ingredients. I've gone into details in other posts about how I shop and prepare food, so won't make this post any longer doing it again.

As always, I'll try to answer any questions you might have. Thanks for reading such a long post!!",12 Years post FIRE update

361,0,"I'm 26 and male, I live in Utah, and I've got a job I enjoy doing

I make $28 an hour, 56k annually. There is room to grow with this company that I'm working for as it's a smaller company turning into a large company. I've made myself very valuable to the company over the years and have helped it grow quite a bit over the course of the 6-7 years that I've worked here. I don't have much job history other than this current job. However, I do have a lot of experience now in IT, management, and administrative type work. I'm a jack of all trades but a master of none. For administrative type work, I single handedly do things like create workflows for different departments in the company so they work smoothly, or create a system that keeps track of production better, or find ways to fix communication issues between departments; stuff like that. When I was first employed, I was only making around $11 an hour and so I've gained a pretty significant increase in pay over those 6-7 years.

I currently live in a studio apartment and pay about $1100 per month in rent. Other expenses such as my car loan, car insurance, health insurance, and dental insurance, add up to about $550 per month. I'm close to paying off my car and so the total would drop to $400 per month.

I'm not married and have no dependants (I don't have much to offer a spouse anyway at the moment. But that's a different discussion)

I don't have a degree and I'm not currently going to school.

I have an emergency savings with about 5k in it.

Im not currently investing in any kind of Roth or 401k.

My credit score is 750 (I actually don't have a credit card. I've been building my credit with my car payment. It's not that I'm scared of getting a credit card, I just don't really care for it.)

Now that all the basics have been explained, time for my question. As stated in the title, I have no idea what I should be doing right now. The housing market in Utah at the moment costs 300k for a crack house in the ghetto and I don't know if I can afford that with my annual salary of 56k. I'm really stuck on what I should be doing. Should I be trying to prioritize making money? Do I go to school? (I hate school with a passion but I love learning.) I really want to purchase a home instead of wasting money on rent at an apartment. I was thinking of moving back home with my parents to save money for a house but they live 1 1/2 hrs away from my work. 

I don't really know a whole lot about anything if I'm being honest. I know what a 401k is, and I know what a Roth is. I grew up with my parents flipping houses and things of that nature so I'm a little bit familiar with how you would purchase a house, fix it up, then sell it and use the money you make as a down payment on your next house. But other than those things, I don't know a whole lot. I also don't want to spend a quarter million on a house where dirty Mike and the boys used to live. I was thinking of, perhaps, flipping houses similarly to how my parents did it. However, like I mentioned before, it's like 300k for a destroyed starter home.

I'm just stuck. I have no idea what to do and I'm just currently floating day by day and it's starting to bug me. The only real goals I have in life is to have a simple middle class house, a cute family, and to have extra spending money where I could just blow $2000 every once in awhile on something like a new pc. That's my dream.

What would your guys advice be? What should I do? Because I have no idea what to do. Sometimes I feel like I'm too old now to start doing anything. I'm only 26 but I have no degree, or any assets or anything. It feels like it's too late for me",Help I have no idea what to do or even where to start

Assume principal balance of 250k (ignore the maths, my query is in principle below about the use of capital)

Then to generate enough money (10k pa) from investments at a 3.5% withdrawal rate, one would require a lump sum of 10k/0.035 = 286k in (ETFs?) to cover the cost of the recurring mortgage payments by my quick maths.

However, now with 286k capital available, would it not make more sense to wipe out the mortgage directly? Excluding early repayment fees etc.. or should one keep the 286k and use the growth to fund the recurring monthly mortgage repayments for the next 25 years?

More growth might be possible by retaining the money yourself vs the mortgage interest saving. However on the other hand you could wipe out a 25 year liability and now your portfolio target can be ca. 300k smaller?

She does have a job that pays 50k salary but her rent is $1500, plus car, phone, and other bills, so she is essentially living paycheck to paycheck. I have worked my fuggin ass off the past three years to go from completely broke at the beginning of the pandemic to having around 50k in savings as of today. I also live with roomies, pay half as much as her in rent, don't own a car, and am generally much more frugal even though I own some nice shit.

373,0,"**TLDR:** If the goal of becoming financially independent by establishing an organically generated cash flow (through labors of love and investments) more in line with the FIRE or FILE concept? Also, should I prioritize investing in income generating investments over growth? 

Hey all,

I hope all is well! I'm just getting seriously into the idea of early financial independence. I believe that there are two kinds of retirees; (1) those who want enough money to do nothing but live a life of leisure, and (2) those who enjoy being productive but want the kind of control over their work life that typically only financial independence can bring. I consider myself to be in the later category, to me financial independence is defined simply as being financially self-sufficient whether that be through investments or money earned through a labor of love on your own terms. I have read a little bit about the FI/RE movement and the FI/LE movement (Financial Independence Live Early). A non-traditional financial life intrigues me. 

I'm currently 34 years old. My current plan is to save for a traditional retirement to support myself after age 65, and then throw everything else that I have into achieving independence between now and then through organically generated income from investments and developing businesses in areas that interest me. Eventually the dream is to make enough money through investments and labors of love in the mid-term where I could quit my job to pursue those full-time. 

While the concept of building a nest egg large enough where I could simply say ""I'm done"" is tempting, it seems to me that the kind of money needed to do that is not obtainable without, in my opinion, being unacceptably frugal and accepting a sub-optimal lifestyle. I figure I would need about $1.5 - 2.0 million dollars saved up in order to live the lifestyle I want from age 45-65 until retirement without working. This is pretty hard to accomplish in the 11 years between now and age 45. Establishing a livable income through various sources including labors of love, say $5k/mo seems much more palatable. Especially since, I don't really want to stop working altogether when I 'retire'. 

Is this more consistent with the FIRE or FILE concept or is it more of a hybrid ? Also, with the goal of establishing consistent income in the mid-term and not wanting to ""Draw down"" a nest egg, should I prioritize in investing in income generating investments over growth based investments?

In the meantime, I’ve been putting 15% in my Roth 401k. I plan on opening a Roth IRA, maxing that out, and then contributing the minimum for match by my company to the 401k. I save about 10% a paycheck in a savings account, and the rest goes to loan repayments, credit cards, brokerage account, unforeseen expenses, etc. I want to open a HYSA at Marcus because I saw they have 3.30% interest accounts and thought it would be better to keep an emergency reserve in my regular savings account and then the rest in the HYSA. 

Down the line, I want to make investments that will allow me to reach financial independence and the possibility to retire early. I think I’d like to buy some real estate at some point and/or start my own company but obviously those are both just ideas at this point.

Also for context I make about $65,000 base with a 5-10% bonus. 

Currently when I get paid, 15% goes into my Roth 401k and 5% goes to commuting costs, both pre-tax. After tax, I usually clear about $1,500 bi-weekly. On average, I’ll put $500 towards my student loans, $500 towards credit card bills (good credit and 0 late payments in 4+ years), $150 into a savings account. With the money that’s left over, I might split it between savings, a brokerage account that I trade in, or jeeping it on hand in my checking account. 

I have a plan that I want to implement but I would love some guidance to determine whether it makes sense or am I trying to do too much.

I want to open up a Roth IRA in addition to my Roth 401k, maxing out the IRA and at least enough to the 401k to get company match.

Then, I want to increasing my savings % a bit and split it between my current savings account and a high yield savings account. Once I have enough in my current savings account for an emergency reserve I would begin to start saving everything in the HYSA. I was thinking 15% of each paycheck.

I'm always searching for a job online since I started giving private English lessons (because I knew it would be an unstable income as some kids quit or their parents can't afford it anymore) but I never found one that I could make money. I've tried several websites like Upwork, Fiverr, peopleperhour, sent a lot of proposals (till this day) never got a project accepted, a dollar here in Brazil is worth almost 6x our currency so even a very low Paying job would be okay.

386,0,"Good morning FI community,

I advise being very careful when placing any specific lot trades with Fidelity - track the lots, screenshot/video your trades, and keep an accounting of your total shares sold somehow.

I've just gotten off the phone escalating a trade dispute with Fidelity and want to warn other folks so they don't have the same issue I am experiencing. 

Fidelity's tax lot trading system is not working properly. The last 2 days I have been selling VTI and VXUS and only selecting lots that showed unrealized losses, in an attempt to 0 out my gains from earlier this year and reduce my income by $3K. 

I have been investing daily-weekly for over a decade and thus hundreds of lots. I am not new to the Fidelity system and in fact worked there for some time and very well versed in their online trading system. 

I started with $15K in gains I needed to negate and started selling lots sorted by greatest loss in VXUS and VTI and making corresponding occasional buys into ITOT and IXUS. I sold several pages/scrolls of the largest negative lots of both. To clarify, I was sorting the lots by amount of gains and losses. This puts the largest negative loss at the bottom of the list of lots. I would select the greatest loss first and working up for a few scrolls of the window, never getting into the unrealized positive gains, and placing the trades after 2-3 pages of lots were selected. 

The preview order page showed estimated losses on every trade I placed. I finished selling these lots over the past 2 days. Today I log in today and see extremely low balances of shares in VTI and VXUS. 

I call Fidelity and they review the orders and say lots were being sold for gains. The trader I spoke with told me that many orders placed had unrealized gains (not losses), and that I had a net gain through all of my trades of several thousand dollars. The trader I spoke with talked to their IT team and supervisor and have told me there is nothing they can do as the trades on their end do not reflect what I was selecting in the trade ticket for share selection.",Issues/Warning Regarding Tax Loss Harvesting on Fidelity Website

I am going to set more boundaries with work this year to hopefully get more time to cook groceries.
2. I do not know why my HRA didn't pay for anything. I am supposed to have a $500 HRA for my healthcare plan but I ended up paying everything myself... gotta talk to HR about that
3. I should have built a stronger emergency fund before buying stocks. I spent a lot of money on stocks at the height of the market in November/December 2021, which cost me a few thousand dollars. I am okay with this though because it is a long term investment. I am now working on getting a proper 6-month emergency fund first before doing any more post-tax investment.

424,0,"Hi Team, I am looking to tap your wisdom on the implication of a backdoor Roth IRA that spans tax years and potentially an 401(k) to IRA conversion. 

Here are the facts

* This year, I opened  IRA with $6000 nondeductable in it. 
* The just started the IRA to Roth IRA conversion, but it won't finish until the first week of January i.e. next tax year. 
* I have a 401(k) with a previous employer I was thinking of moving to an IRA next year, which would be after the Roth conversion, but in the same tax year as the Roth Conversion.

* Background: school and college taught me nothing about making money. Economy class focused on the tax we all pay and how to not spend too much and all the other basic bullshit.
* Goals / reasons  
1. The ability to buy anything I need without having stress about money and guilt about how many hours of job-work it took me to make that money (FREEDOM). Currently, everything is way too expensive in my country and jobs don't pay enough.  
2. To help my family, my parents have never had much money but they have always been here for me, I would love to help them financially  
3. I've been interested in philantrophy since young age. I want to help the world around me and I believe I can best do it once I have alot of money. I'm aware there are other ways, but this is what I'm going for.  
4. And I just want to say, I'm not here for big houses or cars or any of that bullshit. I just want to make much money so I can live a normal life with no stress about not having money. In my personal life I'm very good at spending my money efficiently and only buying things that will really benefit my personal life relative to the cost. I don't buy stuff that I don't need.

* I tried google and youtube. But here, there is SO MUCH information that I get overwhelmed: there are 1000 ways to get rich, which one is better, which one is the best for me, what should I do? Which information that I find is correct and trustworthy, and which information in the internet is not correct? I can find alot of information online, but this is like a puzzle of 10 million pieces that seem impossible to put them together. I have seen so many youtube videos and ads about how to make money, but most of the time they are just talking empty stuff and not actually teaching me anything, or its a video that for some reason feels like they are trying to scam me... Basically there are millions of get rich guides on the internet, and I don't know how to navigate myself through all of this, I don't know which resources to trust and use and which resources to not trust and use.
* Books I haven't tried, I could, but I hate reading alot of text at once because of my short attention span, I'm also not willing to spend money before I know for sure that a book is really full of good information and trustworthy. I'm aware that selling ""how to get rich"" books is also a business model, and I don't want to get scammed

443,0," Leverage is the use of a small amount of resources, such as money or time, to produce a larger impact or result. It can be applied in personal finance, time management, and interpersonal relationships. In personal finance, leverage can be used to multiply the impact of an individual's financial resources and increase their returns on investment, but it can also involve additional risks. In time management, leverage can be used to focus on high-impact tasks and delegate or outsource lower-impact tasks to be more efficient and effective. In interpersonal relationships, leverage can be used to build strong relationships and use the resources and connections of others to open up new opportunities and expand influence. Overall, leverage is a powerful tool for maximizing the impact of resources and achieving greater results.

&amp;#x200B;

So I had some investments into growth stocks which turned out to be worst of my decision and hence I was looking to rebalance my portfolio and also do some tax loss harvesting with my income. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in on income tax state state and hence I only pay federal tax. I want to utilize $3K per year tax loss harvesting by selling those growth stocks. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Can I do this tax loss harvesting using turbotax (I am assuming it will be taken care of automatically by turbo tax once I fill in my W2's and 1099 (from brokerage account) ?

&amp;#x200B;

2) I DCA into couple of indexes(think VOO/VTI) every week. Do I need to make sure that my growth stock is not present in this large index to not present if I want to DCA and use TLH? Or is it advisable to not invest in such indexes for 60 days ? 

&amp;#x200B;

3) If my capital loss is &gt; 3K$ (let's say it is 5K) then how will the 2K get carried over to next year ? Again will turbotax take care of this automatically as mentioned in (1) or I need to do something specifically for this ?

453,0,"Just like everyone here, I am aiming to FIRE early. My personal goal is to retire by age 40. However the way this year has gone, I’ve been pretty deflated on the outlook of my financials. 

Now, I don’t mean to be ignorant because I understand that I am still in a very good situation than most and am forever thankful for this. I am always trying to better myself and figure out how I can take the leap forward. 

Towards end of 2022, Here is where I stand:

29 years old

180k real estate investment equity 
137k taxable brokerage 
70k cash
98k 401k
12k HSA
10k crypto 

Total: 500k+ 

I also have 100k in student loans and make about 350-400k as a physician and $1500 monthly passive income from real estate. I currently live in a paid off home that my parents own but do plan to own a larger home with mortgage next year. 

The reason why I feel bad about this year is because my brokerage/401k has lost over 100k since end of 2021. I’ve probably lost more than 35% of my portfolio when the market has been down 20%. I’ve learned my lesson that investing in single stocks or hype mutual funds like those of Cathie wood are not the way to go. 

On the flip side, I’m thankful that I’ve invested just as much on real estate (single family rentals) that are steadily yielding me a 10% cash on cash return. 

My question is, where do I go from here? Do I keep putting money in my brokerage (in index funds as market is down), or should I invest in real estate? Or should I aggressively pay off my loans? 

I feel like when I think about this, I always fear that my choice will be wrong and it may put me behind substantially. 

Anyone else feel this way? Any tips from someone who may have been in a similar situation? How do I come to these decisions that keep me sane mentally?

Thank you","Is it just me, or did this year put a substantial dent in your FIRE endeavor?"

472,0,"Hey all,

I'm attempting to do a backdoor roth ira. Despite all the info available on this, I can't find any on my specific situation, and I'm hoping folks here can help (standard disclaimer: I'll consult a tax pro as well).

My situation:

* I make too much in income to contribute to a Roth IRA
* I accidentally contributed to my Roth IRA, *however*, I never invested the money. It's just sitting as cash in my brokerage Roth IRA account

Here's my understanding of how I can fix this

* Transfer the money out of the Roth IRA to my bank account. I'd take out exactly what I contributed. Since it's just sitting there as cash, I don't need to sell any positions
* Transfer the money into a Traditional IRA with the same brokerage
* Immediately convert that Traditional IRA into my existing Roth IRA (which already has money in it)
* Because I'm transfer the principle contribution which was already pre-tax money ($6k), and because it never had any gains (it was just sitting there as cash — at best it has whatever marginal interest is gained in the cash account), I won't owe any taxes (taxes would just be on any gains)

Questions

* Is the above correct? This feels weird — I'm basically just transferring money from account to account in my brokerage
* Should I do anything different? In theory I could maybe recharacterize my contribution to the Roth IRA, but that seems complex and time-consuming (idk much about recharacterization). Am I right to stick with the above instead?",Backdoor Roth IRA Question (mistakenly already contributed)
473,0,"I have seen enough websites and youtube videos explaining how money works. I know that working a job, and saving, is not gonna make you rich. I know that trading my time for money is very limiting and that it isnt the only way to make money. I know I need to invest my money and knowledge and time, all 3 of them, into making more money. I know that making my first million once I'm 80 years old is pointless. So my goal is to make alot of money fast.

But the problem with all these online sources of information is mostly this: they tell me great philosophies about money, but they don't give me an actual guide that lets me jump from thoughts into action. They tell me what to do, but not how exactly to do it. For example, when someone says you have to invest money to make more money out of it. Thats good to know but then I still don't know HOW to invest money and make more money out of it. What do I invest my money on? Stocks? Start my own business? I know there are many options, but that exactly is the problem, there are too many options and I can't afford investing so much time in studying everything. I would be 30 and still studying everything and still be poor because I didnt take action.

So what are some good sources of information that can actually guide me through action? And by that I mean advice, not like ""invest money and knowledge to make money"", but rather like ""make an account on X website, buy these stocks, etc.."" because even after so much money philosophy, I believe I have an idea of how money works in this world, but I'm still completely clueless on how to do it myself.

Over the past 3 years, I've contributed a total of exactly $4,242.

When I sold everything in the Roth, I withdrew exactly $4,854.00.

There was a federal withhold of exactly $485.40.

The remaining money that went into my bank account was exactly $4,368.60.

I would also frequently buy and sell assets within the Roth (sold Mutual fund VTSAX to buy individual stocks).

QUESTIONS:

I understand that there is a penalty of of withdrawing from the Roth before 59.5. Was the $485.40 federal withhold that penalty?

Is there a way I can avoid taxes if I withdrew due to homelessness? How would I file this?

Do I have to pay taxes on $4,854?

493,0,"So my mother has fallen on some hard times. She's single, works part-time and is on disability, and is struggling with depression. I am considering buying a low-cost home and renting it to her sometime in the next couple of years as her options could run out for housing. She's currently roommates with a friend and that situation is not guaranteed long-term. 

I would buy something low-cost enough that if she had a health problem and could make rent easily, it would be not a big deal at all for me to cover it. Like 600/month. My income is 215k and my current mortgage is $1500 a month, so it's pretty feasible. There are communities close enough to us selling homes for 60k-100k for seniors. 

Questions:

\- Can I buy a 55+ community if I am not 55+. She is 55. 

\- Assuming it's a manufactured home, how much risk am I taking on? How much should I beef up my emergency fund? Obviously, I'd get it thoroughly inspected.

\- What other things should I consider about this situation?

510,0,"I know the SWR of 4% vs lower set points were frequently discussed here. Ben Felix, and I respect and appreciate his financial educationAl content just release a new video with great details why one should consider a lower SWR rate.

The video “The 2.7% Rule for Retirement Spending”

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FwgCRIS0Wg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FwgCRIS0Wg)

brings in multiple arguments on why the US equity market has done so much better and Ben builds up the discussion around the newer paper study on “The Safe Withdrawal Rate: Evidence from a Broad Sample of Developed Markets“

[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4227132](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4227132)

&amp;#x200B;

My takeaway is that the content and arguments made are well researched. Just dismissing the arguments for considering a lower rate as the new norm if one wants to be within the 100% success rate carries risks. I know setting the SWR is a personal choice. I do agree that fixed rate is not the best method as well and will personally target a variable withdrawal rate, but have not set my final goal yet.   
What I found valuable and good confirmation is the spilt of equity/bonds 60/40 to hold up as well as being more internationally exposed when it comes to investment distribution.

512,0,"Hi, some of you might remember my [original Reddit post with the Simple FIRE Tracker v1](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/spm9lo/simple_fire_tracker/) I shared with you about a year ago. I spent some time updating the tracker based on your valuable feedback (see the link below). Thank you for your feedback, and please keep it coming.

**Here are the included updates:**

* Exposed in editable cells some key values you wanted to change often (column S). Previously those values were embedded in formulas and difficult to find. Now there is no need to edit formulas anymore.
* Included checkboxes beside every account to allow declaring selected accounts as tax-free. This way any selected account tax values would not negatively impact the final calculation.
* The more accurate calculation for the ""Monthly net income... (Inflation adjusted)"". The inflation is now applied on a monthly level instead annually. 
* Improved formulas
* Improved visuals

My goal is still the same, to create the simplest possible spreadsheet so everyone can use it to get the results quickly. There are many amazing advanced spreadsheets, but I wanted to go in a different direction and make a spreadsheet that anyone can populate in about 30 minutes, once a year, and visualize their progress.

**Get the Simple FIRE Tracker v2.0 here:**

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eaM-o1JNnEn7j4834\_suRbpWd1KTZHgmBv0rJuhODwk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eaM-o1JNnEn7j4834_suRbpWd1KTZHgmBv0rJuhODwk/edit?usp=sharing)

To start editing values go to **File &gt; Save a Copy** and this would save the spreadsheet into your personal Google Drive. Make sure you are logged into your Google account first. Otherwise, this option will be grayed out.

**Description**

There are two components on the main tab:

1. **The FIRE Playground** allows you to test various strategies. Add your data into the grey fields and see how realistic your FIRE plan is. Change your FIRE year, investment values, contributions, average inflation, etc... All grey fields are meant to be editable.   
It is interesting to play with numbers. For example, imagine you sell your property and include all the money as an investment while lowering your monthly contribution as you would now have to rent. The final numbers will show your investment value at the desired FIRE year, how much money you will be able to take every month, and even how much money would that be in ""today's money"" so you can better understand if that would be enough to live comfortably in retirement.
2. **The Actual vs Benchmark Performance** chart is independent of ""The FIRE Playground"" block. The numbers for this chart are coming from the ""Periodical Account Values"" tab. Go there and add your numbers and delete what you don't need.   
In this example, Alex and Sasha have different investments, starting at different times. In the rightmost column is the benchmark value (\~$1.5M in 2032). This is the amount they believe will be enough for them to FIRE in 2032. The final result is the graph chart showing where Alex and Sasha are currently on their journey. They are catching up with the benchmark!

Please keep in mind, this is not an advanced tool. It is created to be simple to use while still providing valuable information. I open all my investment accounts on January 1st and add all the values into this tracker.",Simple FIRE Tracker v2.0

530,0,"**Backstory**

Early 40s, single no children located in southern CA. I co-founded a tech company that was acquired early 2021, my background is in software engineering.  I had to stay on board after the acquisition for a bit, but it netted me enough to reach my FIRE number(4M).  Mid 2022 I quit my job at the new company.  I was completely burned out.

I had a Vanguard 401K account for around 15 years, but it was something I just consistently put money in and never checked the balance.  So I consider myself an investing beginner.  

I signed up for Vanguard personal advisor services to help with the initial investing strategy.  They set up a conservative 60/40 portfolio.  The plan was to start the portfolio with a lump sum then dollar cost average until I was fully invested…  Then the market dropped and I reduced my monthly investments because I got spooked.  Didn’t pull anything out, just reduced monthly contributions.

**Current Setup**

I’ve got \~20% invested in the stock market and the rest invested in t-bills and high yield savings accounts returning around 4%, enough to live on at the moment.  

**Thoughts**

Reaching FIRE does not mean you’ll be worry free.  When I didn’t have any money I wasn’t really concerned about world events… Now every mention of recession or inflation stresses me out.  I’ve always had problems with anxiety so this might just be me, but seriously the news is so toxic.

Find something to be excited about before FIREing!  I’ve started a new project but it’s really not as exciting as I’d like. Make sure you have something passionate to work on.  I’m still searching for that. 

Flexibility and free time is amazing!  

**Next Steps**

I need to decide if I should up my monthly investments or continue to keep living off t-bills\\interest.  It seems like that first year of FIRE is critical so it’s got me nervous about getting fully invested in the stock market and starting to withdraw from it.

[1] House remodel

[2] One time windfall


**Expenses**

Current expenses are $8,400/mo, broken down as:

* Mortgage (PITI): $3,100/mo
* Childcare: $2,800/mo
* Utilities: $200/mo
* Misc. shared expenses (travel, insurance, groceries, etc.): $1,000/mo
* Black hole of personal expenses: $1,300/mo

Mortgage, utilities, and shared expenses ($4,300/mo) is just the cost of a family of 4 and I think they're fantastic for the Bay Area.  The only vacations we take are to visit family, for example.  The mortgage is for a 3 bedroom house.

Childcare will drop off within the next five years, but we're actually looking at hiring part time help for the weekends, so this number will only go up in the short term.  I have mentioned elsewhere that I literally have to do basic tasks, like mow the lawn, at night after the kids go to bed because they're so difficult

The ""black hole"" category is a bit of a cop-out, and I imagine there's stuff to cut there.  I do eat out a lot for work, to the tune of $500/mo.  Most of the rest is medical expenses (Lasik in one eye, a few $200 doctor visits became &gt;$500 trips to urgent care thanks to Covid cautiousness by doctors)


**Thoughts**

* After 15 years, I have &lt;10 years of expenses saved up (excluding home equity).  This is while making what I consider a high income (average ~$160k in 2022 money).  This is discouraging and honestly makes me doubt the viability of FIRE for the vast majority of families because our ""fixed"" costs are so high.  I am definitely much more pessimistic on FIRE as a movement this year
* My house was a horrible investment.  According to Redfin, my share of the house has appreciated exactly with inflation (20%, or ~150k) since I bought it.  However, I also spent &gt;$200k renovating and expanding it.  That money is, as of today, completely gone
* Speaking of horrible investments, 2018-2022 I traded a few tech stocks (AMD -&gt; TSLA -&gt; NET -&gt; RKLB).  I gained 10X on the first 3 over three years, then lost 75% on the last one in one quarter.  I'm totally out of individual stocks again and will remain so for a while",My 15-year financial history: deep in the boring middle
542,0,"My husband and I are trying to decide how to do my 401k elections for work and we are looking to buy a home soon too. My elections are only changeable twice a year- in January and in July.

I’d like to squeeze what money I can into my 401k because I’m pregnant, due in July, and plan to be a stay at home mom after that. So I’d like to contribute half of my paychecks. My husband is concerned about this because we want to secure the biggest loan possible while I still hold provable employment and his concern is that if they see my total take home pay, we won’t secure as large of a loan as if I contributed less and had a higher take home pay.

I was kind of under the impression that mortgage companies look at your pretax pay for their loan determinations but I don’t want to screw us over either. Does anyone know?

572,0,"Hey, 

I just realized, that if human life span increased by just 20-25 years, rich people would essentially be ultra rich. Sounds cryptic, but let me break it down. 

By increasing the life span, I mean that a 48 year old would feel like a 28 year old and so on. 

Lets say that if you put in 3000$ a month into investments, and began so at 23 years old. You compounded them at 12.2% per year (more or less safe returns) by putting your money into blue chip stocks. At 12.2% returns, your money doubles every 6 years. 

Here is the math -&gt;

[https://www.calculator.net/annuity-calculator.html?cstartingprinciple=0&amp;cannualaddition=0&amp;cmonthlyaddition=3000&amp;cadditionat1=beginning&amp;cinterestrate=12.2&amp;cyears=60&amp;printit=0&amp;x=74&amp;y=11#annuity-result](https://www.calculator.net/annuity-calculator.html?cstartingprinciple=0&amp;cannualaddition=0&amp;cmonthlyaddition=3000&amp;cadditionat1=beginning&amp;cinterestrate=12.2&amp;cyears=60&amp;printit=0&amp;x=74&amp;y=11#annuity-result) 

23, net worth a 0$

at 33, its 680,000$

at 43, its 2.8 million$

at 53, its 9.6 million$

at 63, its 31 million$

at 73, its 99 million$

at 83, its 313 million$. 

As you can see, the REAL effects of compounding in this scenario come into life after 30 years of investing (at the age of 53). From 23 to 53, the wealth rises by around 9-10 million$. But from 53 to 83,  it rises by a whopping 300 million$. 

By the time you get to see the real effects of compounding, you're already old and frail. 

If human beings aged slowed by about 20-30 years, you'd see that a lot more people would be ultra rich, and would actually enjoy their money since they'd not be so old. 

The only way I make sense of this is that even though I'm  really old by the time the compounding magic comes to life, atleast my children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy the fruits if my labour. 

It was a cool realization.",Compounding and ageing just BLEW MY MIND

My income is high enough to live a comfortable life but I want more. So I brainstormed the last weeks what I could to make more money. I already started investing in crypto two years ago but this is just a sidenote. I also go to seminars to broaden my knowledge and professionalism in terms of social work.

I thought that it should be a job that could do remote from PC as I have a dynamic worktime. I also have time while on nightshifts which I want to use. Maybe I could work doing commissions.

My ideas: Programmer, Webdesigner or 3D-Moddeling-Artist.

1. I have Almost zero experience in programing but I'm pretty smart, a fast learner when interested and I am good with computers.
2. I was in a design/artist highschool and have experience in design and using most Adobe Softwares.
3. I also have experience in 3D-Moddeling using blender as it was kind of a hobby earlier in Life.

2. Which path is the fastes to learn respectivly to professionalize?
3. Which profession is paid better after becoming a fulltime professional?
4. In context with what I told you what would you advise me overall and mybe apart from my own suggestions?
5. What ressources, books and subreddits would you advise me to read at?
6. Got any other ideas or prompts what I could do?

581,0," My wife and I are in our early 30s.  I’ve had a long-time love of technology and work at a large tech firm.  I’ve been in tech for about 15 years and have always loved it.  I don’t think I ever want to RE, but we’ll see.  

I love my job.  I’d be working on some open-source project if I wasn't getting paid.  I make stupid good money and never want to stop.  I get to play with the latest and greatest tech, I have minimal meetings, and my work is super flexible.  If it's a good powder day or I want to go for a 3-hour mountain bike ride I can generally skip out on work without much issue.  When I do take long stretches off work, I enjoy ramping up some of my other hobbies, but I yearn for the engineering work.

My wife and I live on the west coast to enjoy our outdoor hobbies more and with our very excessive spending we live on about $80,000 a year.  This 80K a year covers our $2600 mortgage, all bills, and us basically endulging in all the food / hobbies we want. This puts our FI number at 2 million.  We have 1.5 million invested and 30% paid.  The reality seems like we will hit FI in no time, and likely keep generating income from our fields of work which we love.  My wife has already reduced her hours and I could always consult part time if something happened where my work-life balance didn’t rock.

So, once we hit FI I plan to expand our spending, because what else would I do with the money?  I want to move my parents out west to be closer with us, maybe have nicer mountain bikes, stay in nicer hotels when we go skiing, increase our charity donations, etc. Why not?

We are likely to be a 250K + household for the foreseeable future, and we’re going to have money way past our FI number… Any thoughts on how to use that to improve life?",What to do with extra money after FI number is met

Little context, neither I nor her know jack shit about advanced finances or mortgage aside from the basic info.

But I did notice she has 733 for a credit score which is beautiful for a 21 year old, and if I had to guess her yearly income it'd be about 50k a year on the light side, more likely around 65.

But anyway the question I wanna ask is; is it a good idea to look into getting a mortgage now while her credit score is highest? I know being under 25 is probably a demerit, but if that's all I don't see why not. Unless active years is a deal breaker, then I'd get it...

I've heard in the past that it's not smart to borrow money or take out a loan and invest it into the Stock Market.

In the past I would take out $10,000-$20,000 loans that ran for \~5 years at an interest rate anywhere from 7%-9%.

Yes I know that ultimately I shouldn't be doing that. Fortunately I got really lucky and placed them into very good blue chip companies before deciding to just withdraw it all and then just dump everything into an S&amp;P500 index fund.

There is another interesting thing about this strategy that I wanted to point out. That even though the interest rates were high at 7%-9%, and the loans were for about 5 years, I would pay them all off within less than a year like anywhere from 6months-8months. So I didn't have to pay much interest on the loan due to paying it off so quickly. My goal was to simply take a large lump sum and quickly put it all into the market. Basically ""time in the market"" &gt;&gt;&gt; all else. It would have taken me considerably longer to wait to accumulate $20,000 with my bi-weekly pay checks.

622,0,"30M. Perpetually single and seems to be the life story. While ignoring that fact, what moves can I make with my money to succeed in that economy that is based around two incomes, essentially for someone who doesn’t want to work forever. I figure if I’m single, I atleast can not work a lot and travel of be with friends and family. Just bought a house in med/high cola in California. Got a good interest rate and price, currently have a roommate paying approximately 25% of housing costs. Have around 100k saved and will be building another unit on my lot hopefully this year. Which will decrease my housing cost to less then 1000$ /month. I’m currently working 2 jobs making about $160k but am planning to quit my second job this year an will be reduced to about 90k/year. I have no debts or loans. I have minimal retirement accounts at the moment and am 7 years in with a government pension. What should I do to plan for this? Also, my main job I negotiated a good amount of vacation currently 4 weeks a year and will be raising to 5 weeks next year.",Any money moves for someone who is eternally single?

628,0,"I started on my FIRE journey back in the 2010s when I graduated law school.  $200k in student loan debt, soul-crushing job, no way out.  FIRE was really what helped me feel more in control of my life.  I started a side hustle e-commerce business and started riding my bike everywhere.  Eventually I felt secure enough to leave my first job and switch to a better job, even though it was a paycut.

Between 2018-2021, I kept the better job and started carefully building a more purposeful life.  I bought some cheap land and built an affordable home that I love.  The lack of financial and career stress has allowed me to be more social, so I feel like I have a more well-rounded life too.

So, to the point.  In late 2021 a friend of mine (someone I met due to my nicer job!) approached me and asked if I'd be interested in joining her personal injury law firm.  I was skeptical b/c it feels a bit scummy to be a personal injury attorney, it just has a stigma.  But my friend explained that if I came on board I'd get a % of every case I win.  That cuts both ways; if I don't win, I don't make any money.

I figured why not give it a try?  I have a ton of savings, so if it didn't work out I could just go get a normal job again.

Well, after a year of this job, it looks like I'll have made about $350k in 2022, and I am working remotely.  It's an awesome job.  Before this, the most I've ever made in a year is $110k.  This is an astounding amount of money to me, and I could possibly barista FIRE now if I wanted to.  I would never have taken this job if not for the position FIRE put me in.  

A lot of FIRE commentary focuses on the end goal (the workless utopia), but grabbing the reins of your own life has a lot of other benefits.  Stay the course.",How FIRE Helped Me Supercharge My Career

We both agreed not to tell anyone, not even family. I'd personally would love to tell my dad though as he hasn't been well and I feel he would be proud. 

And finally, oddly I have a strange feeling - I've had a very bad week at work and have a voice in my head saying ""run away - travel abroad"" and rent the paid off house. I would get more than enough to live a decent life. 

If I use my intelligence, it says stay in my high stress job and keep saving, invest in more property or stocks. I won't rush into anything but in an odd way achieving the dream has made me lose focus in the past couple of weeks.

653,0,"This was my first year making enough money that using a backdoor IRA was worth it. Due to a combination of other factors and my propensity to procrastinate, I didn't realize this until very near the tax deadline. I hastily read up on backdoor IRAs and did what I thought was correct, but I clearly didn't do enough research. Anyway, not here to make excuses, just trying to figure out what I should do now.

The situation:

1. I had a traditional IRA with ~$8k in it. In April 2022, I made an after-tax contribution of $6k for tax year 2021. I know this opens me up to the pro-rata rule, though it's a pretty small balance I'd have to pay taxes on.
1. The bigger mistake was that I put the money in VTSAX. Also, VTSAX has not done well since April, so I have a decent chunk of losses.

Options I think I have:

1. Convert everything to a Roth IRA. My understanding is I'd have to pay income tax on the portion of the Traditional IRA that was contributed pre-tax. That shouldn't be a huge tax bill and this is probably the easiest thing to do.
1. I think my employer allows rolling my IRA into a 401k. If I understand correctly, I could rollover only my pre-tax portion to a 401k, then convert the post-tax portion to a Roth IRA. I've been reading [White Coat Investor's](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/backdoor-roth-ira-tutorial/) article to try to understand this better.

In either case, I'll have a loss on the money that I contributed post-tax. My understanding is that's just going to complicate my paperwork come tax time next year, but other than that there's not much to be done about it.

Mainly looking for confirmation that I do / don't understand this correctly and advice on which of the paths I should try to take at this point. And yes, I'll be more careful going forward. Thanks!","Made mistakes with my backdoor IRA, trying to determine best path forward"

667,0,"Help me if you can and show me the right direction for Financial Independence.

I am 45, married with two kids 5 and 8 and primarily single income household with wife just starting a new job at $40k. We live in a HCOL area. I work for as a Program Manager in a large Pharma company. Base comp is $196k. Short and long term comp add to another $100k. I have been with them for about 3 years with first stock option given at end of year 1. Every stock option has a 3 year vesting period. 

At this time total stock I have been given is $116k split as $53k vesting in Jan 2024 and $63k vesting in Jan 2025. I expect an additional $53k stock grant in Jan  2023 and vesting in Jan 2026 (not included in above $116k). The total of my retirement savings (401k, IRA etc) add up to about $1M. 529k balance is about $101k. Outside of this I have a 6 month emergency fund and use YNAB which shows I am 4 months ahead on a monthly budget. My house is fully paid off and worth $750k.

The company is doing a large scale reorganizing and 85 pct of the IT jobs are being cut and the reason for reorg is the consolidation of two business lines and business layoff impact is 50pct. I have been notified that my job is being eliminated with expected impact date in H2 2023. The earliest this will occur is Oct 2023 and could be as late as Jan 2024. The company will give me a 90 day hard notification (what was communicated is a soft notification) before this occurs. If I wait for the severance I get about $220k split as follows assuming impact date is Oct 2023.

1. Prorated short term compensation (bonus for 2026). Assuming 30pct bonus, this would be $58k prorated to $48k as of the month of separation


2. Prorated long term compensation out of all the stock awards above which would add up to $97k because of the following:

Jan 20 2024 vesting ($53k) prorated = $48k

Jan 20 2025 vesting ($63k) prorated = $35k

Jan 20 2026 vesting ($53k) prorated = $14k

3. 20 weeks severance pay which would equal $75k

I am thinking of relaxing for the rest of 2022 and put in place plans starting in 2023. I am looking for advise on whether I should wait for the severance, collect the package and then look for another job or start asap and start looking for a job in 2023 and forego the above or perhaps get lucky enough finding an employer who would atleast take on the long term comp that I will leave on the table. An additional challenge I am running into is I am unable to find similar paying jobs anymore. I don't know if my age is against me. If I don't find similar paying jobs could I take a lower paid job especially given that I don't have a lot of expenses except saving more for retirement and kids college expenses?

698,0,"FI Progress and setbacks

My previous post was deleted because it wasn’t sufficiently related to FI or RE and it absolutely is. So hopefully the moderators review it again and I can get the feedback I am seeing from fellow enthusiasts. 

I have been working on becoming FI. I started too late and now I can’t help but feel insecure about my financial progress

I am not sure what I am looking for here. Some reassurances? Someone to say I’m doing ok? All I know is this is seriously stressful to the point where I can’t seem to enjoy life now because I keep preparing for the life tomorrow and I am far from certain I’m doing enough. 

Some of the responses have been that I have too much money or too much household income to seriously complain but I don’t believe any of these preclude me from having issues that I am seeing feedback on. If my money offends you, please skip to the next post. We are both first generation immigrants and started in the US with nothing and no social or family safety nets. 

I am 42, my wife is 44. My wife is a registered nurse who will make about $200k this year. Between investments, my business income and an STR property we own and I run I’ll make about $200k this year as well for a total HHI of $400k. 

We own a primary residence and an investment property that we STR. 

Our net worth is about $1.5m which includes equity in the properties, about $600k in cash and liquid investments and about $210k in retirement savings. We max out my wife’s 401k and I have a small IRA but generally I am unable to take advantage of IRAs due to income and I don’t have nor can I get a 401k (hard to explain but this is the case). 

We started accumulating capital very late but our current expenses are very low and we’ve been saving and partially investing 100-150k or more in cash every year for a few years. 

Problem is while my wife’s income is stable (although depends on some overtime) mine is unpredictable and I fear that my business will not survive next year. The plan is to exit with a $300k or so before tax and wind down operations. Kinda sad since this business took 10 years of my life, profitable 10 years but still. 

It would bring my net worth up to $1.8m or so with almost a million in cash or liquid investments. So there’s some room to play around. 

I have no current plan beyond that, maybe acquire a few more STR properties as they’re profitable. 

I feel like I have to have more going on at this stage of life. I feel like I should be more secure in what I’m going to be doing next. 

I also want to enjoy my life now. Instead I feel my life shrinking and me getting smaller emotionally. I can’t bring myself to spend because I am uncertain in what tomorrow is going to bring.

I am 42, my wife is 44. My wife is a registered nurse who will make about $200k this year. Between investments, my business income and an Airbnb we own and I run I’ll make about $200k this year as well for a total HHI of $400k. 

We own a primary residence and an investment property that we Airbnb. 

Our net worth is about $1.5m which includes equity in the properties, about $600k in cash and liquid investments and about $210k in retirement savings. We max out my wife’s 401k and I have a small IRA but generally I am unable to take advantage of IRAs due to income and I don’t have nor can I get a 401k (hard to explain but this is the case). 

We started accumulating capital very late but our current expenses are very low and we’ve been saving and partially investing 100-150k or more in cash every year for a few years. 

Problem is while my wife’s income is stable (although depends on some overtime) mine is unpredictable and I fear that my business will not survive next year. The plan is to exit with a $300k or so before tax and wind down operations. Kinda sad since this business took 10 years of my life, profitable 10 years but still. 

It would bring my net worth up to $1.8m or so with almost a million in cash or liquid investments. So there’s some room to play around. 

I have no current plan beyond that, maybe buy a few more Airbnb properties as they’re profitable. 

I feel like I have to have more going on at this stage of life. I feel like I should be more secure in what I’m going to be doing next. 

I also want to enjoy my life now. Instead I feel my life shrinking and me getting smaller emotionally. I can’t bring myself to spend because I am uncertain in what tomorrow is going to bring.

746,0,"My husband (33M) and I (also 33M) started really contributing to our retirement accounts hardcore around 2017-2018, so all we've seen is the rapid rise of our accounts from around $60K (I didn't start keeping track of growth before then) to around $410K last December, in 2021.

Then the correction started. And we've continued to max out our 401Ks like we've been doing for the past several years, along with some other contributions to taxable accounts and the like.

All in all, in 2022, we've contributed about $50K to our retirement accounts.

Yet, despite that, our account balances are nearly exactly where they were 1 year ago today.

I love that we've been able to ""hold the line"" as it were, and I know that ""stocks are on sale"" so this is a good thing as far as our long term balances are concerned.

But I also am super excited to see what that discounted ""50K"" bought us in terms of non-depressed value. I.e. when the correction is over, what are our accounts going to balloon to?

(Sidenote: Is there any good calculators out there to visualize that?)

Anywho, I know this is obvious to most of us, but this is the first time in my investing-life that we've encountered a bear market. Provided my husband and I can keep our high-paying jobs throughout it (and don't worry, we have a 1 year emergency fund if we were to lose one or both), we're excited to see what comes of the diligence to keep investing and not panic-selling like the average consumer.

748,0,"Hi,

A few years ago, I learned that the order should be as follow:

1. Max HSA first
2. Max roth IRA next
3. Max roth 401K (employee) next
4. Max mega backdoor roth next
5. Max roth 401K (employer) last

For example, the 2022 max contribution limit for a single individual under 50 yo is $61000. To maximize roth contribution, one should contribute as follow:

1. $3650 to HSA (max allowed $3650)
2. $6000 to roth IRA (max allowed $6000)
3. $20500 to roth 401K employee side (max allowed $20500)
4. $34500 mega backdoor roth (max allowed $40500)
5. $0 to roth 401K employer side because the #2 + #3 + #4 above already reaches $61000 limit.

Is my example above correct? Please share your thoughts.

By the way, this is for self employed people who control their 401K plan and the level of contribution on both employee and employer sides.","What's the ""proper"" priority when it comes to funding various retirement accounts?"

755,0,"Reckoning 2022 for me it's really painful.

Same amount of money in my accounts than I had at the end of 2021.  
I own no assets that could bring me additional income or free up time.

I feel like I've focused on the wrong stuff this year and, as a consequence, made no progress towards my goal of become FI.

Two years ago I escaped the 9-5 rat race and become a freelancer.

The first year was the year of famine: tough to find clients, under paid, hard to make enough to live.

Second year things improved: too much work, higher rates, still hard to make enough due to 50% extorted in taxes + costs

With year 2 of freelancing came the realizations that in order to stay afloat, there are no weekends, no vacations, if I'm sick, it won't matter, I have to work anyway.

I realized how, in fact, I've just changed prison, not earned my freedom.

Maybe I shouldn't complain too much. I work way less than a 9-5, make more, live abroad and can setup my schedule as I desire.

But still... it's not enough. 

I want to spend my time working for myself, not for others. It hurts deeply inside keep spending precious lifetime  doing stuff for other people, rather than living my days in excitement building stuff I enjoy.

Reading Naval Ravikant was enlightening, as I understood that I need to build and own assets in order to really achieve financial freedom (and wealth).

2023 goal is not to make more, but to make the same through assets.

I want to build stuff that makes me money long-term.

It's risky, but I've decided to call off all the freelancing partnerships I've built this year, stop freelancing and try to build some income stream in the 3-4 months of runaway I gathered.",Freelancing is another type of Rat Race — Seeking FI in 2023

771,0,"I am young and currently a 1099 contractor with very little money in my Traditional IRA ($7500, with $4400 of it contributed this year in 2022, as a 1099) and am thinking about converting all of it to Roth. 

My question is on the taxes side. For the sake of an example, assume I receive a 1099 form before April's tax season that shows I made $80K (total) for 2022. If I convert all $7500 to a Roth IRA, do I pay taxes on the $80K PLUS the entire $7500 that was converted from Traditional to Roth? Or do I only pay taxes on the $80K PLUS ($7500 - $4400) because I haven't actually formally deducted the $4400 from my taxable income yet in 2022? I would assume it's the latter, because otherwise I get double taxed for the $4400 amount, but assumptions are bad because tax laws can be weird.

For context, I had previously worked W-2 with an employer that offered a 401K, and when I left that company (to be a contractor), without knowing anything about retirement accounts, I converted it to a traditional IRA. Now that I am educating myself, I realize a Roth 401K probably makes more sense in my specific situation.

772,0,"About a year ago I made a post about my goals in 2022. In this post I am reflecting on how that went, and thinking about what goals to set for 2023.

My 2022 goals:

* I'm working fewer hours and only on things I *have* to do. I'm trying to avoid taking on new projects and responsibilities
   * *Nailed this one.*
* Am training others so people don't feel lost when I leave in the fall/winter
   * *50% complete. Have not left yet, that is happening soon.* 
* Am cleaning up my investments, budgeting etc. so financially I'm comfortable with the plan
   * *I consolidated investments and accounts. TLH complete. We created a budget! Am comfortable with my plan, even though the markets are down this year. We have enough cushion in the swr to weather typical downturns and SORR.*
* Talking to my spouse a lot about it. She is amazing and totally supportive. Kids are too young to understand anything right now!
   * *Ongoing, and she* ***is*** *amazing.*
* I'm trying hard to think of what I'm going to spend time on next. This is the hardest part. Right now the leading idea is to give myself a break of 6 months to a year after I retire, where I don't take on anything where I exchange time for money. After that I am most likely to mess around with a startup idea that doesn't require massive amounts of time or $ investment. Or maybe I'll be fine with not doing anything for money, *ever*. I'm in my very early 40s, so the idea of being done for good is scary.
   * *Also an ongoing conversation with myself and family. I don't have a clear idea of what I want to retire to. I feel like a freshman not knowing what to major in. One day I want to be a writer, another I want to develop a startup. I'm trying to let it come to me organically, but darn it is taking time!*
* For the moment just focusing on physical and mental health. Almost 20 years of unhealthy grinding has definitely taken its toll, and it is hard work to detox.
   * *Achievement unlocked! After a long time I have truly focused on my well-being, and proud of myself for having put in the hard work this year.*

For 2023, I have a shorter list of goals:

* Travel more
   * Thinking 2+ times, at least one international
* Be more ""present""
   * I've always planned for the future, for security. Going to push myself to be more in the present and rediscover my goofy self
* Retire from current career, and reinvent myself
   * Reinvent how? I dunno. Any ideas?

Ever since the account hit 100k, I haven't done anything to re-invest the money.  The business I'm running doesn't require huge upfront fees or heavy expenses that would require me to have a lot of cash on hand.  I've gone back and forth many times about what I want to do with the money.

808,0,"**tl;dr:**  A baseline SWR of &lt;=3%, using the 3-4% range as headroom for unexpected or one-off expenses, seems like a good way to manage uncertainty about both expenses and investment returns without being excessively conservative.  Do others do similar things?

**Long Version:**  FI budgeting is difficult due to dealing with uncertainty about *both* investment returns *and* expenses.  No matter how carefully one budgets, there will occasionally be large unexpected or one-off expenses that aren't reflected in a ""typical"" annual budget.  Unexpected expenses are ""stuff happens"" things like large out-of-pocket medical or legal bills, not things like normal home maintenance and repair that can be roughly budgeted for even if the specifics aren't known in advance.  One-off expenses are related to major life events even if they're not unexpected.  Think weddings, moving expenses, home remodels, once-in-a-lifetime trips that exceed the normal travel budget, etc.

A 3% SWR basically never fails, at least historically.  A 4% SWR is still fairly-safe even for early retirees, but failure probability goes up drastically if withdrawal rates go even slightly above 4% or if equity valuations are high.  Trying to *always* keep WR below 3% even in high-spending years where unexpected or one-off expenses occur will result in a WR well below 3% in *most* years unless you have a lot of unexpected or one-off expenses.  This is excessively conservative because it assumes near-worst cases for both spending and investment returns, which are independent in a statistical sense.  Choosing a baseline WR closer to 4% leaves little headroom for unexpected or one-off expenses--you'll need to either ramp up your WR to dangerous levels or make painful cuts elsewhere to afford these.

Using a 3% baseline WR for ""normal"" spending and treating the 3-4% range as headroom to deal with unexpected or one-off expenses without cutting elsewhere is a good balance.  It's virtually guaranteed to work unless *both* investment returns *and* expenses end up far towards the ""bad"" end of their distributions, which is far less likely than either alone, and it deals somewhat-explicitly with *expense* uncertainty.",SWR And Spending Uncertainty

[Article](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/08/investing-in-an-era-of-higher-interest-rates-and-scarcer-capital) (paywall)

Context: ""One popular approach since the 2010s has blended passive index investing in public markets with active investing in private ones. This saw vast amounts of money flow into private credit, which was worth over $1trn at its peak. Roughly a fifth of the portfolios of American public [pension funds](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/05/can-you-afford-to-retire) were in private equity and property. Private-equity deals made up about 20% of all mergers and acquisitions by value.

One side of the strategy looks vulnerable—but not the part that many industry insiders are now inclined to reject. To its critics, index investing is a bust since tech companies loom large in indices, which are weighted by market value. In fact, index investing will not disappear. It is a cheap way for large numbers of investors to achieve the average market return.""","""To its critics, index investing is a bust since tech companies loom large in indices, which are weighted by market value."" - The Economist"

848,0,"I am currently saving up for a wedding, a honeymoon (which can wait), an RV (houses are far too expensive nowadays), a caravan, and a 4WD/Jeep/UTE. We'll need to settle for used ones, but that's okay, as long as they do the job. The reason we want two mobile homes instead of just one is because my partner has 2 kids, 14 and 16, so they can keep spending holidays with us if they like (or in case one of us ever needs space for a bit). I'm about to turn 28 and he's 39 - yes, it's a bit of an age gap, but It's not like we're 18 and 30, and we actually have a really good relationship of 5 years. We plan to move back to the USA (Northern Michigan) in the next 5 years, at which point we will sell the vehicles and put deposits on new ones, or possibly a 1-2 bedroom house/apartment. My partner and I have lived with my parents since the pandemic (which is embarrassing considering our ages) and are paying rent. The kids live with their mum and stepdad, he pays child support &amp; splits the school fees with their mum, and I pay for other stuff like clothes/school uniforms and shoes.

We will be setting a wedding date once we have enough money to move out (when we are able to buy at least 1 motor home). I'm hoping to earn the motor home money in 6 months, then have the wedding by November of next year. I also want to be stable enough to have, or perhaps adopt a child by the time I'm 30 (though I/we may still decide not to have any more kids).

My job pays about $40,000 AUD per year, which is not good, and I don't have the kind of skills that get you get a 6-figure job (I am not tech savvy, I dont know anything about mechanics or handy work, I suck at maths and science, and I will never in a million years be socially skilled enough to work in sales or marketing). So I'm really going to need to get smart/creative with this, alongside finding a higher paying job. I have good literacy skills - I'm a high school English Tutor. I also work with a few university students. So I can write a good CV/cover letter. However, my communication/social skills are atrocious (if you've seen The Big Bang Theory, I often get compared to Lucy, Raj's ex-girlfriend), which makes it extremely difficult to get past the interview process. I've taken classes and have worked with a therapist over the years, but I still have a long way to go. It took a year for me to finally land this tutoring job.

My special skills are specifically in the arts (drawing, painting, crafts, and sculpture), which is a horribly difficult industry to get into. I can do very basic web development (HTML and CSS,  but not Javascript), but I'm not qualified. Plus, with Wix, WordPress, and everything else, people don't need web designers that much anymore. I can play piano at about a grade 4 level (for example: Fur Elise, Rondo Alla Turca, The Entertainer,  Moonlight Sonata - except for the 3rd movement), but I'm nowhere near good enough to be any kind of concert pianist. Maybe just sweet background music at an event. I also just started a little partnership with the cafè at the Mayo clinic in my town, where I sell my gift baskets and chocolate bouquets (it was approved by the cafè manager, but it may still end up falling through if corporate disapproves). I've been trying to sell portraits and gift baskets online, but soooo many people are doing that right now, and I'm not really getting much business - I will need to speak with someone who specialises in marketing and advertising. But even then, its going to be very hard to earn the amount I need just with that.

I have a bachelor's degree in educational studies, which qualifies me to be a tutor or teaching assistant, but not a teacher. Again, due to my poor speaking skills, I failed my prac assessments, so I just settled for a lesser-degree.

So, what are come smart/creative things I can do to earn that kind of money is a short amount of time? Whether it relates to my current skills or not. Selling the house or our car is not an option. I've tried selling all the furniture we don't need but nobody wants to buy it (though even if they did, that'd get us $5000 at best).

What are some ideas? I know this is a long-shot, and it will be ridiculously hard, but I'm willing to put in the work. I just don't know where to start.","What can I do to earn $200,000 in 2 years?"

Things I'm changing after making the post.

Maximizing HSA contributions

Adding more to ROTH 401k, as the employer contributions don't count the same way

This should be evident but I'm always looking to improve and make more money at my current job, which seems very underappreciated on my original post at r/investing and I do like my job, and I'm very happy with my life, so please do not ask if I hate my job or my life, they're both great and I'm happy.


Original Post
I want to break down my current position for you and if there's anything I'm missing please ask in the comments.

I'm currently 23, I've saved roughly 35,000 as of now adding all my assets. The past few years I've not saved a ton of money as my jobs didn't pay much, recently I've gotten a job that pays very well compared to any of my past jobs, easily over 60k/year, and will be looking at a 30% raise within the next 5 years as well, on top of this I've applied to a salaried position that may increase my pay even more, if I get the job that is.

Calculations for 2023 limits
Right now my situation is that my employer will match 7% of to my ROTH 401k which depending on how much I make is looking at 5800-8000 contributions from my employer, doing the math on the conservative side leaves me responsible for 323$/week for contributions to meet the limit by EOY. I also save an additional 125$ a week for 2023 ROTH IRA contributions. On top of this I contribute 25$ to my HSA which my employer will match up to 1,000/year of, the HSA is set up to be invested in a growth large cap ETF, as well as my ROTH IRA and 401K in the same growth large cap ETF.

My biggest concern is the excess income I make, a good problem to have I'm sure, but retiring at 40 means I won't preferably be touching my retirement until retirement age, luckily I can still withdraw contributions if I ever need considering it's ROTH. I make around 800-1200$ a week after all deductions, 125$ of this will be going to ROTH IRA. so let's say 675-1075$ left over. I took the average and it was around 1,000, so with all my other bills which I have very few I'm left around 700$/week in free cash flow if you may. I want to put this money to use, as of now I've just been putting the money in an investment account and investing long term, but I spoke to a RFA friend of mine and we got into the situation he suggested Real Estate as a way to leverage myself and diversify, his suggesting was to get an FHA loan on a 1st property, a single family home or duplex, and live there to build equity instead of paying rent, and to invest in a 2nd property as an investment property, and putting the minimum amount down on the FHA property and putting 20% down on the investment property.

I've spent the last year really focusing on my long term financial goals, I'm willing to do whatever this takes, is there any other opinions or any ways I could improve my current outlook? I've spent the past few months learning everything I can about RE investing and focusing on working and saving as much money.

880,0,"A bit about myself (32 years old)

* finished my PhD a month ago
* Relocated with my fiancée to a HCOL area 
* Began my career as a senior scientist ($125k base salary, gross savings rate at 32%)
* Fiancée also landed a new job ($115k base)
* No debt (for either of us)
* I hold minimal assets ($4k in my 401K, $6k in my IRA, $5k saved)

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about my goals and situation:

*  FIRE, with an emphasis on RE. The sooner the better, but I don't yet have a target FIRE number or age.
* Rent this year is $47k (our relocation timeline was very aggressive and we kind of screwed up our landing spot. No worries, only signed a 12 month lease).
* Squandering so much of our income on rent has me finally wanting to build equity, so saving up for a house has become a new priority for us. Targeting to buy a house in the $500k-700k range in 1-3 years.

**What i'm struggling with, and the point of this post, is to better understand if the benefits of a higher down payment justify lowering investments in other areas.**

I've charted 4 scenarios below:

&amp;#x200B;

||*Scenario 1*|*Scenario 2*|*Scenario 3*|*Scenario 4*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**401K contributions**|$20,500|$5,625|$41,000|$11,250|
|**IRA contributions** |$6,000|$0|$12,000|$0|
|**Down payment**|$12,000|$32,875|$32,000|$73,750|
|**Purchase date**|Nov 2023|Nov 2023|Nov 2024|Nov 2024|

*(note - I do not receive a bonus in 2023, but I do in 2024, which i've added to the down payment)*

&amp;#x200B;

In scenarios 1 &amp; 2, I buy a house in 1 year and in scenarios 3 &amp; 4, I buy a house in 2 years. The differences between these scenarios boils down to this question: *do I max out my tax-advantaged accounts and put leftover money towards the down payment, or do I lower my investments in tax-advantaged accounts in order to make a bigger down payment*? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my line of thinking: My 401K/IRA should net \~10% ROI. Every extra dollar I put towards the down payment, above the lowest $12k scenario should net \~5-7% ROI, depending on what sort of interest rate I lock in. Also mortgage insurance isn't a factor here because in all 4 scenarios i'm putting down less than 20%. So is really that simple and scenarios 1/3 are the best choices?",Max 401K/IRA or save for bigger down payment?

890,0,"Hello, 

The great men/women here pursuing this noble cause of FIRE movement are most likely to reach FI by an average age of early-mid 40s i think, but very few are able to cross over the line and bite to bullet of RE.  

Makes me wonder why is that so. When in the holy spirit of FIRE, RE is the main part or the the part where the rubber hits the road (ok, the wheelset hits the rail). Since to be honest, we as Indians/Asians   by nature have always had quite healthy saving rates and are comparatively much more frugal. So FI comes easily or naturally in the process . I dare to believe, our previous generations and many others currently (in so called middle class category) who were/are oblivious to the concept of FIRE, were and are Financial Independent without much effort by mid 40s-50s with simple financial prudence and humble living.  

However, many of us fascinated by the idea of RE and hence drawn to FIRE, settle at either the comfort zone of FI or just just keep moving the goalpost of FIRE target or FIRE corpus or are stuck in one-more year syndrome.  

So, why is it so difficult to retire early? My assumption is that anyone on this sub or on this path is not so motivated by corporate jobs/ rate race culture and wants to own their time, so just FI doesn't help . 

I can think of two evils of human nature , same two driving our dear markets .. FEAR and GREED ..

**FEAR : Train to Busan** 

Fear of unknown black swan events (hyperinflation / war times/ extreme recession/stagflation , terminal diseases wiping out chunk of n/w)  

**GREED :  The Gravy Train** 

 I consider corporate jobs as gravy train, where its so difficult to leave the greed and comfort of monthly paycheck. Its much easier if someone kicks us out of the gravy train (forced FIRE), else our gluttony consumes us and even if we haven't inflated our lifestyles with rising salaries, we still can't leave diving in that pool of gravy and stockpile some more.  

So which train are you riding now. ??

There are few, who have had courage to get off the train and enjoy the destination. Rest of us just keep dreaming what an amazing chapter of life will start when we get down, but in reality we are just on a train to nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I need your advice because I'm a bit desperate and don't know what to do. I tend to think of myself as a bad parent who didn't teach my son financial literacy and independence.

&amp;#x200B;

I did spoil him, but I did give him a helping hand a lot of the time. But I thought I was doing a good thing for him and us.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that my son got this girl pregnant when they were both in college. When that girl's parents found out that she was having sex, they cut her off. Her parents are very religious fruit.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my decision was to help them financially. I found an apartment for them and paid for it. I also paid for the nanny, so they could graduate, find a job and start living for themselves. I even came to babysit my granddaughter on the weekends, so they could focus on their social and personal life.

&amp;#x200B;

But, after graduation, they didn't seem to rush to find a job. They always blamed the pandemic and the financial crises that followed it. So, instead of looking for a job, they announced they were expecting again. I think it was obvious that I was really disappointed by that news.

&amp;#x200B;

I would first cut him off if my son didn't have kids. But now I can't do this because cutting them off would be the same as kicking them out of their apartment and literally making those children suffer. Maybe it's the right step to encourage my son. But I can't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to explain that he needs to think about the future and that I won't be there forever to help them. I asked him to find a job and finally do something with his life. I've been hinting and sending these resources — [https://www.doughroller.net/investing/how-to-invest-50k/](https://www.doughroller.net/investing/how-to-invest-50k/) \- so that he can start learning his financial literacy from somewhere else.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I think the least I can do is stop paying for that apartment and ask them to move in with me. I have plenty of space, and we all can fit in. At least the money I'm spending on an apartment, I can invest or put in a savings account for my grandchildren's future.

902,0,"The 4% rule seems to assume that after thirty years your net worth will be depleted. Many people in the FIRE community seem to have a ""live the life you want and save for it"" mentality, which seems to be a more refined version of YOLO. But basically many seem to agree that you should live your life and die with nothing in order to maximise what the money can do for you while you are alive. However, there seems to be a problem with this idea which is that people tend to live for longer than expected and age care is not cheap. 

I've looked at the lives of many old people and a lot of them seem to end up in overcrowded nursing homes. They have little privacy and the the ratio of nurses to patients is low meaning there is little care. These people generally have run out of money. 

However, I have seen a multimillionaire old man who lives in a self-contained unit in a retirement village. The self-contained unit has a button that he can press that sends a nurse to him on demand. This man has never married and never had kids and basically lived a frugal but comfortable life all his life. He plans to die a multimillionaire and give everything to charity upon death.

If you only have a moderate emergency fund and all your assets are tied up in retirement, you significantly lose out on the flexibility to make radical lifestyle changes.

I’m the son of two addicts (with one deceased), who dropped out of high school at 16. I’ve done menial jobs since then and continued to set myself back due to poor decisions and a lack of guidance.

My wife is the daughter of humble beginnings from Mexico whose had her own struggles to work through, too. 

My wife made the gamble of a lifetime by taking the chance on me. I’m really grateful to her.

And after a few too many set-backs, wanting to be better for my wife and daughter, I decided to grind out a Masters Degree in Teaching (elementary school) to take advantage of an international teaching career. I literally got licensed to teach this November.

With mine and my wife’s teaching degrees, we decided to move to China, where salaries are high and living expenses are low, in which we now work as teachers for an international school. 

And though I’m well aware of the criticisms surrounding a move to China, we stepped forward into our new roles fully ready to embrace everything it has in store for us (good and bad). And knowing where I come from, anything is better than that. 

However, it’s quite honestly a dream package, despite the obvious short coming of living in China post-Covid.

We live on campus and don’t pay rent. We have meals provided. Open gym. And we receive free tuition for our 8 year old daughter. Our colleagues are awesome, and my school is giving me a lot of amazing opportunities that I wouldn’t find anywhere else.

In fact, we’ve single handedly managed to save more in our first month’s salary alone here, than what we’d previously saved had for an entire year before coming.

Combined, our salary is roughly 130k before tax, without including annual bonuses and extra work offered by the school. 

As it stands, we feel quite confident that we can save roughly 75% of our income during our time here, while still living in relative comfort.

We plan to stay for 5 years, and save as much as we can until our daughter finishes Primary School… and then consider our options.

Then two things happened. The first is that I started getting really bored. The typical thing we read here of people lacking purpose now that work has been removed from their life.

**First, a disclaimer:** I acknowledge that my NW is relatively high for my age. I am not self-made. I owe much of my current situation to my wonderful parents for covering my tuition and most of my expenses throughout college. I also owe a lot to my grandmother who helped kickstart my investing journey at age 19 with a gift of $10K.

I'm a 23-year-old male who lives in a Texas city and works in a finance-related career. I graduated in May with a degree in finance and began working full-time this July. I worked three internships throughout college and worked part-time during my junior and senior years.

|:-|:-|


# Asset Allocation:

My investing strategy centers around dumping cash into index funds as quickly as I can manage. I was almost all S&amp;P500 initially, but I've since added some additional complexity through factor tilts, geographic diversification, and leverage (via margin debt, levered indices, and futures).

|TMF|$4,173|2.9%|

# Asset Allocation Rationale

**Factor Tilts &amp; Geographic Diversification:** 

I have moved my portfolio away from all S&amp;P 500, and instead have bought indices that also capture small, medium, and large-cap equity exposure across US and ex-US developed and developing markets. I have also incorporated factor tilts (value, momentum) in hopes of generating premia. While I hope to capture the historical premia these factors have provided, minimizing risk is my main priority. While the S&amp;P 500 has been a great historical investment, I prefer to diversify across companies of different sizes as well as minimize my geopolitical risk. It's not obvious that growth and US equity will continue to outperform (particularly growth). Also, the historical and potential asset covariance is a plus.

**Leveraged Indices:**

In August of last year, I chose to participate in \[Hedgefundie's Excellent Adventure\]([https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007)) with about 25% of my NW. Needless to say, with equity drawdowns and especially interest rate hikes, I regret this decision. However, I always viewed HFEA as a lottery ticket, and am not too torn up about this current loss.

**Margin Debt:**

I borrow against my current stock (\~1.4x levered) The downsides are margin call risk and the cost of financing debt (currently 5.75%; I'm willing to hold this margin debt with the expectation that equities will outperform). I carefully evaluate historical drawdowns and only hold margin debt amounts that I am comfortable with (more margin means less portfolio drawdown to receive a margin call).

**Futures:**

Currently, I hold one S&amp;P e-mini contract at 2x leverage. I prefer futures over LEAPS options given the lower cost of financing, and the linear returns with the underlying asset (no extrinsic value component). I'll likely get involved in treasury futures for the sake of diversification and generating higher returns.

# Closing

Ultimately, much of my investing involves leverage. I don't believe this is necessarily foolish. Just as 100% stocks while young isn't inappropriate for most, I don't think 110% or even 150% stock exposure is unreasonable for those with the risk tolerance. If you're interested in looking into the subject more, I recommend giving the book \[Lifecycle Investing\]([https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/](https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/)) a read.

My FI number is $5MM, and I hope to reach this by age 45.

928,0,"I posted about this before but I can't find the old throwaway account I posted it on. If you want an IN DEPTH detail of my last experiences with attracting jealous best friends, DM me and I'll send you the link to the old post, this subreddit does not allow links.

I'm a single 25 year old male and I have this never ending cycle of attracting friends who become bestfriends, but then start competing with me.

Now I've attracted another CLOSE friend who's beginning to compete and become envious of me for the FOURTH time.

The reason why I'm asking for advice again is because the last 3 individuals for the lack of a better word weren't as ambitious or successful as I am. I don't mean that in a cocky way, but to give some context. I make 100k a year, recently moved into a penthouse style apartment, fairly good looking, and I'm always looking to be a positive &amp; inspiring voice for those around me. So I can see how someone who isn't on the same level (again not trying to be cocky) may feel insecure around me. But the close friend in question now is totally different. He's way more successful than me in terms of financials. He makes 300k a year and has multiple streams of income. He also gets more girls than me (not by a huge margin but objectively scores more girls from what I see and what he tells me) and if you've read my old reddit post in the link above you can see why my ability to attract girls has turned my past best friends against me. I mention his accolades because I thought that if I found someone closer to my level or above, has the ability to get girls, there would be no need for them to have jealous or competitive tendencies. But he's starting to show the signs that I've experienced with the last 3 close friends I've had.

Context I believe is important to mention before articulating the jealous/competing signs: We're both single and we both enjoy ""the game"" in talking to girls at the bar, club, and inviting them back to after parties that are hosted at my apartment on the weekends. We go out with 2 of our other boys that we hangout with frequently. We usually have anywhere from 5 to 10 girls back at my place after we go out. So there's enough to go around.

The signs &amp; actions I've observed from him:

1 on 1, the best time in the world. We shoot the shit, talk about business, our next moves to becoming better men, and overall a great, uplifting, motivating, and positive time. Around girls, takes every opportunity to impose or show he's the alpha or leader. For example, tells me to pour him a shot in an overly aggressive ""I have to show these females who's the boss out of us"" type of way instead of asking me. If I'm talking to one of the girls, he finds a way to interrupt me or physically gets in the middle between the girl I'm talking to in a subtle way like leaning over and looking at his phone. At the end of the night when the girls are ready to go home, he'll make it a point that he'll personally walk them all back to their cars and tells me I can stay in my apartment. When we're having a group conversation with girls, we all show respect to whoever is talking by making eye contact and actually LISTENING but when I'm speaking he finds a way to distract whatever girl is next to him to have a side chat that disrupts the flow of the conversation or he'll look down at his phone. He frequently whispers to a girl, points at me and laughs when he thinks I won't notice it. More recently he's made it a point to repeat the same sexual experiences he's had with multiple women within the same conversation that seems like it has the intention to annoy me or see if I'll get jealous. He recently asked a girl if my social media profile gave off ""fake lifestyle"" vibes. The next sign shows what I believe to be a selfish attitude. It was him and I at my place with 5 girls and I called our other 2 boys to join us because they were at the club with us (they just took a separate car) and he told me to tell them that there were only 2 girls so the ""ratio isn't good for more guys."" Mind you, these other 2 friends are solid dudes who would drop everything if you called them for any situation.

We've been close friends for around a year and this has all happened within the last month. Before all the shenanigans, he had no issues interacting with me around girls and respecting me. It was simply I had his best interest, and he had mine and it was genuine. For whatever reason things are starting to shift and I'm at a loss of why.

If anyone can give me insight on why this frequently happens to me, I'd love to hear it. Maybe even dig tough questions at me to see if there's anything I'm doing wrong that I'm not noticing. Any help with this consistent issue I have would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR - I attract friends who become best friends, become jealous of my success with girls, business, careers, education, and engage in behavior to put me down. However the current friend in question is more successful than me in terms of finances and girls.",I attracted another jealous best friend for the 4th time....

Are you tired of living paycheck to paycheck and constantly feeling like you're struggling to save money? Well, I've got some tips and tricks that can help you start saving and take control of your finances!

1. Make a budget and stick to it. This might seem obvious, but it's the foundation of good financial management. Figure out how much money you have coming in each month, and then make a plan for how you're going to spend it. Be realistic and don't overspend.
2. Cut back on unnecessary expenses. Take a look at your budget and see if there are any areas where you're spending more than you need to. Are you paying for subscriptions you don't use? Are you eating out too much? Can you switch to a cheaper cell phone plan? Every little bit adds up, so take some time to review your expenses and see where you can save.
3. Save automatically. Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account so you're consistently putting money aside. You can start small and increase the amount over time. The key is to make saving a habit.
4. Look for deals and discounts. Before you make a purchase, check to see if there are any coupons or sales that can help you save money. Sign up for email newsletters from your favorite stores, and follow them on social media to stay up-to-date on the latest deals.
5. Save your windfalls. When you get a bonus at work, a tax refund, or any other unexpected money, put it into savings instead of spending it. This will help you grow your savings quickly.

Follow these tips and you'll be well on your way to saving more money and achieving your financial goals. Happy saving!",My go-to guide to financial independence. Happy saving!

939,0," I have been working in a family business for over three years. I worked in sales prior to that. I have a bachelor's degree in business and I currently work at an investment management firm where my father is the managing member. We look for small and micro cap companies with strong cash flow yields and strong balance sheets. I am trying to market our fund and get it to a greater audience so I travel to talk to other investors and family offices. I had lunch with someone who went to Harvard a few weeks ago and the people I am speaking with and/or working alongside manage millions of dollars. I also work with a group of women who own a marketing firm in New York who have been helping me build our brand and our business.

I am in my mid 20s and I have been able to build up my savings to almost $100k and pay off all debt. We have opportunities to potentially align with another family office to have a bigger platform and work alongside other people as well as manage more money. I have a steady income and although it can be pretty lonely and I don't have many coworkers, I feel it provides a lot of security and stability. If I wasn't working here, my father would hire another analyst so I am not in this role just as a ""favor"" although I do of course recognize the favorability.

I have gotten comments recently that I am taking the easy way out by working for my dad or that I should do something else. Someone else even said ""I may as well go back to living at home with my folks."" It has taken a hit to my self esteem and makes me wonder if I should go do something else.

943,0,"This will probably be a little long, but I think there is some good advice for others in here.

I was financially illiterate until about 7 years ago.  I thought living in debt (and substantial debt) was normal because I had a good credit score.  I had gone to expensive schools and was only making 40k a year.  When my wife became pregnant in 2015, I finally started to do financial planning and realized we were not doing well.  Our household net worth was about -$200,000.  

I had a co-worker tell me about Dave Ramsey and I started listening to him and followed some of his principles to start getting out of debt.  I did this for a few years, which did help some but our financial picture changed much more quickly when we discovered FIRE in 2019.  Our household income had gone up significantly (140k) and our net worth was -80k.  We were making progress but that was mostly due to selling cars.  At this point, we decided to get serious with our savings rate by saving over 50% of our income.  I opened a Roth IRA and maxed that and the 401k each year going forward.  In addition, we were paying extra on debt and contributing to a taxable account to use as a bridge account for when we FIRE.  I hated my job at the time, so I had lots of motivation to try to save more and more.  By the middle of 2022, we had a net worth of over 250k.

My wife, was never excited as much as I was with FIRE and wanted to travel and spend some funds but I saw different goals in front of us (coast fire, lean fire, fire, fat fire).  Well, everything came to a head when I was laid off a few months ago.  During that time, we discussed what we were doing and realized that our goals did not fully align.  That being said, we decided that pushing through with a high savings rate until we hit coast fire would be our goal and it would happen in 3-4 years.   
After relocating for a job I was genuinely interested in and had a great team, I was making 10k more.  Everything was back on track, or so I thought.

The problem was I went from a job I hated to this new one that I love.  I now like coming to work and my motivation to pursue FIRE is almost gone.  I think I was doing FIRE for the last few years as I was in a job that I despised.  Starting this month, I dropped our savings rate to \~35% and will now build retirement slowly over the next decades.  With this savings rate, I will likely become financially independent in \~15 years anyway, but it is no longer a race.  This flexibility now gives us more room to travel, eat out, buy clothes and have hobbies.  I did not realize the impact that this would have on our happiness after years of having no flexibility in this area.

**Lessons learned:**

1) If you are miserable at your job, it is not good to suffer through it for years until you can FIRE.  This is even true for higher income jobs.  Look for a new job if you feel this way.

2) If you are married, be on the same page as your spouse and be flexible.

3) While starting young is beneficial, you can start later in life with a large negative net worth and end up turning that around with a high savings rate and being intentional.

4) Do not pursue FIRE without a good reason.  What will you do when you FIRE?

5) For FIRE, do not sacrifice the journey to get to your destination quicker.",Why I am leaving traditional FIRE after 4 years and lessons learned
944,0,"Been saving and investing HARD since I had my first job. I've always thought about how I can own something that takes on a life of its own and pays me passively. I had always thought I could figure out a way to FAT FIRE considering I was very fortunate to have no college debt, a small inheritance from grandparents, and a pretty income. As time goes on my pay is going up but I am sadly still only able to replace 30% of my income from passive sources. No I don't need to live on 100% of my income, by I have a hard and fast rule that if I were to retire my passive investments need to #1 yield enough to not have to sell shares or assets #2 have enough left over to allow for some small amount of reinvestment. 

As things are shaping up it seems like my FIRE journey is looking further and further away and it is starting to get depressing. I've always been a saver, borderline cheap person due to the FIRE dream, but now I am thinking it is time to just enjoy life a bit, buy that XBOX, get that sweet desk I've been looking at, book that vacation, and just accept that a day job is probably going to be my future for at least another 20 years. Anyone else feeling that way? It has been a gut wrenching shift in mentality for me...but I feel like I am starting to turn grey and just can't figure out how to juice what I have for more to get there faster. 

The crazy thing is and this is not to brag...but I feel like I started with a pretty massive advantage over most folks. I started very early on investing, had help with buying some real estate, and have a financially savvy family who encourage and support this journey. Regardless I seem to be missing the mark on how people can do this in their 30's and 40's and have any sort of life. 10K in a 6% yielding stock gets you 50 bucks a month in yield...and that's generally only possible via REITS or something safely. Not to mention taxes so forget actually keeping 50 a month. Safe dividend growth stocks have stupid low yields right now and will take another 30 years to grow to a respectable yield on cost.

I guess what I want to know is what are people doing here to keep the dream alive? How many are really getting to FIRE or FAT FIRE before say 50?",Getting frustrated and starting to dial back my FIRE focus.
945,0,"i dont actually believe in not selling my index funds, i think i should be selling my entire portfolio when a recession is coming, that way i can at least profit my gains right at the top and buy the low. If i dont sell and just keep DCA, i will lose so much during a recession. I know some people will say dont time the market but i actually can, i wont be able to get it down to the exact day but i can get it down to the month of when i think the market will crash. 

it takes 2 years for a market to recover from a crash on average, if i dont sell, i will lose on that entire 2 years of gains...

for example we know 2023 will be having a crash so up until december 14, there will be a mini rally after jerome announces the 50 bp, i can just sell at the rally and wait for the drop. I know it wont drop 20% in 1 day but the fear will price in gradually base on the daily performance, signaling a sell. It just seems so stupid to me that WE ALL KNOW there will be a recession coming, if not , at the very least  a huge drop in the market in 2023, but there are still ppl advising us to just not "" time the market ""...this would only hurt our portfolio.

My wife and I are both teachers. We have an income of about $150k together. 

We will receive state retirement until we die after 30 years of employment. 

I owe $44k on my current house. If my estimation is correct it will be paid off in this year or next. Once that is done I’ll be 100% debt free.

(Together my wife and I have $30k in student loans but if that is waived then I’ll be debt free)

I have $30k in our savings account, $5k in $100 bills in our gun safe. 

I put $600 into a Roth IRA that invest in a s&amp;p 500 simulator. I believe it’s called voo. 

My question is should I buy another house? The house we live in is the right location it’s just small and not every nice. We are embarrassed to have people over because of how bad it is. We have done minor things to make it look nicer. But for instance our washer and dryer are in our living room. The floors need to be redone. 

My thought process has always been to put every extra dollar we make into paying off the house. I have this thing against paying interest. I hate it. 

I just want someone to give me some financial advice.",Should I buy a house??

I am the top performer in the nation of a team of 12 . We have the same/similar experience. We are the same age and started at the company on the same exact date.

In a recent review cycle, I shared with our manager that I felt I was under compensated and I asked for “X” and got “Y”.

My manager told me that getting “X” was on the very high end of the range, and that I wasn’t at that point just yet. It turns out that my coworker who shared her compensation is getting paid “X”.

969,0,"If you're looking for a female escort, you're not alone. You can find them on Instagram, too. To find them, simply type ""escort"" or ""girlfriend experience"" into Instagram's search bar. Once you've found a potential escort, message them to ask them to do something special for you. When messaging them, remember to make your message as complimenting as possible.

You can also search for escorts by location. There are escort directories that allow you to view photos of escorts in specific areas. You can also browse hashtags related to your area to find specific types of escorts. You should be careful though - some escorts might be scammers and not real people. Therefore, [buy gmail accounts reddit](https://accbuzz.com/product/buy-old-gmail-accounts/) be careful when trying to find a local escort.

Once you've created a secret profile on Instagram, you can search for escorts using specific keywords and phrases. Try searching for ""escort"" in the search bar and you should find numerous profiles matching your criteria. However, it's important to be selective when looking at the profiles - you want to find someone who is experienced and offers high-class service.

You can also look for sex workers on Instagram. Many of them have ads in their bios and are open to sex work. Be sure to follow other sex workers on the site and look out for any posts with links to their personal page. In addition to following other models, sex workers, and photographers, you can also search for those who promote social causes.

Instagram is a visual social networking platform that's quickly becoming a hotbed for escorts. For example, the Strip Chat website has an Instagram channel where the girls advertise their services. Some oversexualized pictures are all over the place on Instagram, and it can be very easy to find a local escort by following these profiles. And you can easily follow the profiles of local escorts without putting yourself in risk of being scammed.

Instagram can be an excellent source of income for escorts. Many Instagram users are simply high-class escorts. You don't need to spend a fortune to get laid on the site - there are many popular hookup sites out there that are more effective.

While the traditional methods of dating and networking for sex work are still in use, Instagram is becoming a popular platform for the sex industry. For example, Jessica Walsh, an entrepreneur in the sex industry, uses the platform to reach men. Before the rise of Instagram, she relied on classified ads, street corners, and phone lines. However, the rise of social media savvy and hashtags are gradually replacing these methods. With the help of Instagram, she grew her business beyond the realm of foot photography. She now posts about three to four times a day.

Before choosing an escort on Instagram, [buy verified gmail accounts](https://accbuzz.com/product/buy-gmail-accounts/) make sure you check their profiles carefully. There are a lot of fake accounts on the platform. Be very careful and report any fake accounts that you come across. Never trust an impersonator. In addition to searching for escorts in specific locations, you can also search for escort profiles by type or company name.

Another way to get noticed on Instagram is by liking other users' photos. It is best to do so without looking desperate. Aim to like two to three photos a week, and don't be shy about commenting.

Let's look at some numbers!



## **Career Progression** - updates in  **bold**!

Year | Job | Title | Compensation | Notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2011 | Startup A | Internship | $15/hour | Landed an internship through a professor while in college.
2012 | Startup A | Junior Engineer | $60,000 (+92.3%) | Graduated with $70,000 in student loans and stayed at the same company.
2013 | Startup A | Mid-Level Engineer | $70,000 (+16.7%) | Promotion
2014 | Startup A | Mid-Level Engineer | $80,000 (+14.3%) | Performance increase. Also, I bought a house this year.
2015 | Startup A | Engineering Manager | $85,600 (+7.0%) | Moved into a technical management role.
2017 | Startup A | Engineering Manager | $91,000 (+6.3%) | Performance increase
2017 | Startup B | Contract Engineer | $20,000 (-78.0%) | Finished paying off my student loans and needed a break from the grind. Sold all my stuff, rented out my house, and moved to San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua where I contracted for a hospitality startup for 6 months in exchange for some cash, room and board, and food. 
2017 | Startup A | Director of Engineering | $110,000 (+450.0%) | Original company contacted me wanting to start an engineering office in Santiago, Chile. They offered me more money and an inflated title to move down and get it running. I got to live abroad, got more money, and got a fancy new title so I took the job. 
2018 | Startup C | Contract Engineer | $20,000 (-81.8%) | I stuck it out for a year but living in Santiago wasn't for me and the job was too stressful. I departed on a motorcycle trip from Colorado to El Salvador. I contacted a friend I had met as Startup A who had started his own digital marketing company and he contracted me for about 15 hours a week.  
2020 | Corp D | Senior Engineer | $267,000 (+1,235.0%) | After an almost two-year motorcycle trip across in Central America and Southeast Asia, I ended up stranded in Sri Lanka for four months due to Covid. Fear of economic disaster prompted me to look for a new job.
**2021** | **Corp D** | **Senior Engineer** | **$277,681 (+4.0%)** | **Performance increase**
**2022** | **Corp D** | **Senior Engineer** | **$294,341 (+6.0%)** | **Performance increase**
**2023** | **---** | **---** | **$0  (-100.0%)** | **At the end of the month, my girlfriend and I we will both be quitting our jobs and going to Asia for 6 months. For the second half of the year, we plan on traveling the US by by van to find a new place to live!**

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/qBhMYZg.png) is a bar chart of my compensation over time.

Career Progression Takeaways:

- **The Sky is the Limit**: When I was in college, I thought if I could somehow figure out how to make $100k a year, I would be set. And it's true, that's far more money than I need to live. But, around 2017, a friend introduced me to a mobile app called Blind. Blind is a toxic social media application where privileged Silicon Valley tech bros openly and anonymously complain about their overinflated compensation packages. A lot of these guys are making a half a million dollars a year or more. I had an epiphany. The only thing holding me back was myself. I was earning what I thought I was worth and all I had to do was mentally adjust what I thought I was worth. In 2020 I was stuck in Sri Lanka for a few months. I started studying, sourcing referrals from the highest-paying companies, and telling them I wasn't considering any offers under $250k. And it worked.
- **Know What You Live For**: I don't spend a lot of money on stuff but I do spend a lot of money on experiences. Most of those losses come in the form of opportunity costs. Traveling can be pretty cheap but quitting your $300k job for a year means you are not making $300k you could have made. But, experiences and relationships are what drives me. It's hard to get over that mental hurdle but, to me, it's worth it. 
- **Filling the Gap**: In 2017 and 2018 I took ~80% pay decreases so that I could take a break from the grind and do other things. During this time, I sourced contract work. I didn't do that for the $20k. I did it to avoid large gaps in my job history. This upcoming trip, I'm not doing that because my job has offered to take me back when I return and I don't love working on the road. My point is, if you do this, just make sure you are employable afterwards. 
- **Set a Date**: Wether you are switching jobs or taking a sabbatical, set a date and stick to it. I stayed at the first job far longer than I should have because I kept saying I would quit ""next year"". I was working in a stressful environment for subpar pay. This year, I am quitting my job during the onset of an economic downturn. This is the best time to be employed so you can contribute to your investments while the market is down. But, I already set a date and I am 100% sticking to it. 
- **The Switcheroo**: Early in my career, I always made the mistake of thinking my job gave a shit about me. Loyalty is not a valid reason to stay at a job - compensation and work-life-balance are. Each time I have made a career change, my happiness, and usually my compensation - has increased.

## **Asset Classifications**

Classification | Amount | Percent | Note
---|---| --- |----
Taxable Brokerage | $796,564 | 76.2% |
401k | $125,931 | 12% |
Cash | $55,321 | 5.3% | This money should should cover me for the next year. I am buying a parcel in Michigan in case the impending climate emergency gets out of control. 
Roth IRA | $46,494 | 4.4% |
Crypto | $12,935 | 1.2% | Doing a bit of gambling. I hit a 5x last time ($80k) so figured I would try my luck again while the market is down. 
HSA | $8,759 | 0.9% |

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/qsKgajv.png) is a pie chart of these classifications. 

Asset Classification Takeaways:

- **Boring is Better**: For the most part, I have been following the classic Boglehead approach that many of us here are following. I max out by 401k, HSA, and Roth IRA (backdoor) before contributing to my taxable brokerage. It's funny how boring this investment approach is. It's simple and lacks the dopamine hit that stock picking has. 
- **Share the Wealth**: Sometimes I get so fixated on personal finance that I forget who illiterate the average person is. I have been mentoring a few coworkers lately who have hundreds of thousands of dollars just sitting in their savings account. I haven't been telling them what to buy or anything - just explaining basics like the value of diversification and how unlikely they are to beat the index. I think it's one of the best gifts you can give someone.  
- **Luck**: I know what you are thinking. This guys numbers don't add up. A few things note here. 
  - First, I finally sold my rental house. I bought my home in 2014 for $295k. At the time, I was just being a consumer and wanted a fancy house with way too much square footage. I ended up getting super lucky on the market timing. When I sold it last year, there was $250k left on the mortgage and the buyer paid out $600k. 
  - Second, my company stock makes up a hefty chunk of my compensation at my current company. When I started (my grant date), the stock price was at $83. I sold at $200. I ended up pulling between $300k and $400k the past two year. That's how I hit $1M regardless of the market downturn.

##  **Asset Allocations**

My taxable accounts, 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA account for **$977,747**  (or **93.5%**) of my net worth. Let's take a look at what that portion of my portfolio is comprised of. 

 Asset | Amount | Percent
--- | --- | ----
VTSAX | $858,613 | 87.8%
VTIAX | $99,052 | 10.1%
Individual Stocks | $13,544 | 1.4%
VNQ | $6,538 | 0.7%

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/AYjqBtu.png) is a pie chart of these asset allocations. 

Asset Allocation Takeaways:

- **Stop Gambling**: I am down **51.4%** (**~$14,000**) on my individual stocks. I'm so stupid. I should really cut my losses and just sell all my individual stocks but I have such a hard time selling when I'm down.
- **Changing the Plan**: In my last post, I mentioned I was following the ""[Core Four Lazy Portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios#Core_four_portfolios)"". As you can see, this is no longer the case. It's partially out of laziness and partially strategic. Please tear me to shreds if you disagree with any of my moves here. 
  - I pulled out of bonds simply because I'm young and really don't mind the risk exposure at this point in my life. 
  - I stopped contributing to REIT's (VNQ) because I owned a home at the time of my last post and felt like I had enough exposure to real estate at that time. 
  - I stopped being anal about balancing my international (VTIAX) and domestic (VTSAX) exposure. Maybe I'm just being lazy.  
- **Don't Be Biased**: When my company stock vested, I help onto it for a while because I worked at the company and believed in the mission. At one point, one of my coworkers asked me if I would invest in the company if I had cash. My answer was no. I sold the next day. You get the idea.

---

## **Liabilities**

None! Now that I no longer have a house I am debt free. 

--- 

## **Expenses**

I'm not aggressively tracking my expenses like I used to. I have gotten so comfortable with my spending habits that I don't really see the point in focusing my energy towards extreme budgeting. 

That being said, I created [this Sankey chart](https://i.imgur.com/MH2Mt7S.png) to give you a rough idea of what my extrapolated 2022 will look like. Since I always get a bunch of questions about how I create these types of diagrams - [sankeycash.com](https://sankeycash.com/).

I still cook my meals at home. I still don't buy frivolous things. I still don't have an Amazon account. I no longer have a car. It broke down about 9 months ago and I never replaced it as I have a pretty nice bicycle I built. 

*But*, my bills have increased. 

A year ago I moved in with my girlfriend. I gave up my $600 (including bills) living situation for a $1,000 (not including bills) living situation. I pay for 75% of the groceries, bills, rent, etc. She makes far less money than I do. I care about her, want her to have a good standard of living, and I want her to be able to reach her financial goals as I have been able to. So I am happy to help. 


-- 

## **Final Thoughts**

I would just like to thank everyone in this community for the plethora of knowledge. 

I would also like to acknowledge that everyone has different circumstances: different incomes, different educations, different levels of privilege, children vs no children etc.

I hope that these posts don't come off as any sort of humble brag and I know that some of these takeaways don't apply to everyone. 

I think there's this sweet spot between building wealth and living your life and I hope everyone here finds it because lord knows everyone deserves it. I try to work towards it every day!

That's all for this time.

999,0,"While it is illegal to log into someone else's Instagram account, there are ways to circumvent this law. These methods can include stealing someone's login credentials or access tokens, selling or transferring their account, and posting private or confidential information. While it is unlikely that you will get caught doing so, it is a bad idea to try them. To protect yourself, follow these tips:

First, set up two-factor authentication (2FA). This system protects your account by requiring you to enter a security code sent to your phone or email address. It's also important to use a strong password, one that is difficult to guess and memorable. Another good option is to use a password manager. A password manager can generate secure passwords and store them in one place, and it will also alert you when someone else's account is accessed.

If you do attempt to log into someone's Instagram account, [**buy gmail accounts reddit**](https://accbuzz.com/product/buy-old-gmail-accounts/) they will be notified via phone call or email that you're trying to access their account. This is important, because it's a violation of their privacy and terms of service. In addition, if you're caught, Instagram will sue you. Depending on your location, you could face criminal charges for attempting to access someone else's Instagram account.

If you're worried about the safety of your account, you can install a third-party app to monitor Instagram activity. Most of these apps are very well hidden, so it's unlikely the person you're spying on will ever realize that their account has been hacked. However, some people are concerned that they may accidentally reveal their personal information through the use of a third-party app. This is a risk that you don't want to risk.

log in to Instagram and fill out a form with your details. Choose 'My account has been hacked' in the form. You should also take a screenshot of the code on the page in question. This will help Instagram get your account back.

Another way to protect yourself from being hacked is to use a strong password. Password managers can be a great help in creating strong passwords. It's also important to change your password regularly. If your password is easy to guess, there's a good chance that it's been compromised.

Phishing attempts have become a big problem online. The use of fake websites and links to steal sensitive information is a common technique for stealing login credentials and can land you in jail. A phishing attack can involve a fake Instagram login page, or even sending the credentials directly to the target's email or social account. It's important to always update your password and profile information to protect yourself from such threats.

One way to hack into someone else's Instagram account is to use third-party apps to monitor their phone activity. These apps can also be used to track the online activities of your child. Despite its ease of use, these tools can be quite difficult to use. [**buy gmail accounts with paypal**](https://accbuzz.com/product/buy-gmail-accounts/) If you have a little experience in coding and social networking, then you can try these apps on a person's smartphone and monitor their activity remotely.

If you are concerned about privacy issues, you can use a spy app that can display a person's Instagram password. These apps contain a keylogger that can record keystrokes on a cell phone and reveal the person's password. This feature can be especially useful for parents who worry about their children's online activities.

You can also use mSpy or eyezy to monitor someone's Instagram account. They will be able to see the posts and private messages made by the person. The other method is Mspy, which is listed further down on this page. Regardless of whether you're using a spy app or not, you should only use it when it's legal: [**read more**](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/z8ckps/what_does_dtx_mean_on_instagram/)",Is it Illegal to Log Into Someone's Instagram Account?

My parents have always told me “do good in high school, get accepted to a good college, get good grades in college, get a good job and work”. I did that. I did great in high school and am currently going to a decent college. I have a 3.75 GPA and I’m a third year. I’m an applied statistics and data analytics major. I’ve been applying to internships and have been rejected from 12-25 and the rest have not responded… yet? I feel like I’m going to end up graduating but not landing a job in the field I majored in… which is such BS. I worked hard all years of college and can’t even get an internship.

And what am I really doing anyway by going to college? Taking classes to get a certificate that tells my employer I can do work competent enough for him/her. I will still be working a 9-5 even though I just spend 3-4 years of my life studying. I’m never going to be an entrepreneur going to college. College just helps you get an upper class 9-5 job. 

So If I don’t get an internship, it most likely will mean I can’t get a job and who knows what I’ll end up working… idk. Man, what has life come to. How does one escape this “society”. Even if I wanted to live off the grid in the US, I cant. It’s not legal to hunt and kill animals if not in hunting season. I would also be living on somewhere were in the woods and would have to hide to avoid being caught by people. Idk it just seems like life is set up to FORCE you to be a worker. John Rockefeller said “I do not wan a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers”. These are the same people telling you to go to college and get a degree.

I’m optimistic and hopeful but to anyone maybe thinking of going to college because you don’t have any other plans after high school, I wouldn’t do it. You’re gonna end up majoring in something you’re not that interested in and switching majors and wasting more time and losing money and your time. Not sure what way one can become financially free but man is it buried away. Not saying college is a scam… trust me I’ve learned a lot and very thankful for that. But at the end of the day we all want to be able to have families , go on vacations on our own time and for however long we want without some boss telling you, you can only spend 5 days on vacation or else… idk.",College isn’t what I thought it would be

I started my FIRE journey 2 years ago with my first high-paying job (contract role). Since I was earning a lot, I got obsessed with making money.

If I was sick, I was working. If it was a public holiday (I am a contractor), I was working. So basically 0 days off except weekends.

I made good money and have savings to last 5 years without a job.

But here is the fun part. My contract role ended 2 months ago. Immediately I started feeling worthless. I started feeling terrible for losing money every day (which I would have been making if I had a job). It was terrible. I had no meaning in life except the job, so I was very upset all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to feel normal now. I feel stupid that I sacrificed all holidays (including the big festivals) just to earn a little more money. For what? Now I have been jobless for 2 months. Taking 2 days off was nothing compared to being unemployed for 2 months. I should have spent more time with my family and lived my life a bit better.

1064,0,"One of the reasons I seek to FIRE is the simple reason I wish to own more of my time.

Money can be seen as the currency of time. The reason why something costs money is that someone put their time into creating the thing I am buying.  When you spend money, you spend someone else's time they put into serving you. If you are a billionaire, you could spend several lifetimes in a very short amount of time. 

My time is the most important thing I can offer to the world. Be it offering to my friends or family, to work, to enjoyment, or the community. 

This makes our time more precious than we might want to admit. Because the future is inherently unknown, we can never know for sure how much time we have. Do I have 50 years, perhaps only 20?

Who of you has wished you had more time for friends and family? That you could work less and enjoy life more? Some love their work and would do it for free. But a lot of us think they would be happier spending their time in different ways. 

If you look at it this way, every subscription service I pay for, every new car I buy, every time I buy something I don't really need I pay with time I could have used in a more fulfilling way.

° Growth withdrawn:

1073,0,"*“How do I make a ton of money”?*

A crass and often scorned question, yet one we’ve all pondered before. Good faith discussions can be hi-jacked by the spiritual (true wealth is internal), nihilistic (be born rich), or political (wealth is evil). These tangents all contain kernels of truth, but they are not actionable. Here are my personal observations, with a bias towards practicality.

First and foremost, the core tenant of making money in a capitalistic society comes down to some iteration of “**provide value to capture value”**. Early in your career, **developing specialized skills** (e.g. medicine, coding, sales, etc.) is a huge force multiplier to your value add. But to reach true fatFIRE levels of wealth, you also needs to figure out how to scale. Whether as an employee or as an entrepreneur, true wealth comes from the ability to **scale your inputs to produce asymmetric outputs**.

What does that mean? How do I scale? Here are three broad (not mutually exclusive, and certainly non-exhaustive) forms of scale that can be applied in one’s career.

# Brand

On the enterprise level, this means **intellectual property**, such as Google’s search algorithm or Pfizer’s patent on the COVID vaccine. It can also mean **literal brands** such as Hermes handbags or Nike shoes. An established brand serves as a moat against competitors from easily entering your market, resulting in higher profit margins for every subsequent product sold. If you work on building your company’s brand / protecting your company’s moat (e.g. software engineer at Google or brand manager at Nike), you will be paid more than those who don’t, even if they work just as hard.

On the individual level, this means developing a rare and valuable skill set to build a **personal brand**, and then leveraging that brand to create value to society. At the highest level, think Joe Rogan for podcasting or Oprah for television, where their eponymous brands provide value to their massive audiences (and subsequently advertisers). But there’s plenty of value to capture in smaller, industry specific niches as well. A KOL in oncology can command huge consulting fees designing clinical trials. A popular author of children’s fiction can generate recurring royalties. A strong brand allows you to decouple your hourly inputs from your monetary outputs and earn at scale.

# Labor

Perhaps the easiest one to understand but the hardest one to properly wield, labor is simply the ability to capture value from other people’s work. If someone creates $100 of value for you, and you pay them $70, then each additional employee you hire represents $30 in value for you (obviously oversimplified). However, why would anyone in a free society agree to let you do this?

One common reason is **apprenticeship**. Whether in medicine, law, or plumbing, marketable skills in many professions must be learned on the job. Less experienced workers willingly trade labor “alpha” for mentorship, often with the idea of paying it forward down the line. An even more common reason is **risk-mitigation**. Take for example a seasoned freelance graphic designer pregnant with her first child. It would be a perfectly rational decision to trade some annual “alpha” for the security of a bi-weekly paycheck and healthcare benefits of a full-time position working for someone else.

In order for you to capture the value of other people’s labor, **you must offer something in return**. Cultivate a rare and valuable skill and learn how to teach it to others. Become an empathetic manager that removes your employees’ professional anxieties (payroll, sick leave, working capital, etc.)  Be cognizant that you are one political revolution away from being eaten by your workers. Yet history has proven being able to successfully manage (or coerce) the labor of others is a proven path for building wealth at scale.

# Capital

On Wall Street, this simply means leverage. Traditional “high finance” (e.g. PE, VC, HF) firms raise capital from limited partners, charge them a fee to deploy said capital, and then share in any potential profits. It is ostensibly no more difficult to manage $10 billion than it is $1 billion, but the associated fees are 10x more. This is scale, in the way of financiers.

But even in “regular” industries, capital plays a huge role in scaling productivity. Start-ups (even cash flow positive ones) regularly take VC money to accelerate their growth. Mature public companies sell stock to raise capital to fund new projects, and issue dividends / buy-back stocks when there are no profitable projects to pursue. Properly deployed\*\*, capital is the lubricant\*\* that facilitates the creation of profitable ventures.

The sarcastic trope of “self-made with a million dollar loan from daddy” has some merit, but the key is to actually know what to do with the capital once you’ve raised it. There is a difference between working capital and disposable income. Understanding the difference determines whether you work for money or money works for you. **Learn to be financially literate**. Doesn’t mean you have to be Gordon Gecko but it’s nearly impossible to get rich without a baseline understanding of how capital markets work.

1078,0,"I want to highlight a cool volunteer opportunity that I think fits very well with the FIRE community. There is always plenty of discussion here asking how to give back, how to occupy your time after FIRE, and most importantly, how to learn about taxes.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I posted this last year and it received some interest so I wanted to send out another reminder to the community that this program is gearing up again for the next tax season. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm starting my second year with an agency as a Volunteer Income Tax Assistant (VITA) with a local refugee agency. The program trains you on tax screening so you can provide free tax prep services to people in need. You don't need to have any prior tax experience, they train you on everything. I started last year with very little understanding of how the tax system works (always had someone else file my taxes), and now I've gained deep understanding of the tax code. VITA programs offer an impactful way for people in this community to use their skills and their passion to give back.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not advocating for a particular program, but if you google VITA in your local area I bet you'll find some programs. A lot of them are even fully virtual. Seems like a great way to help out whether you're FIRE'd or not.

You should just give up. It isn't going to get any better. It is actually much, much harder.

Most mentally sound and physically attracted women settle down before age 30. Most people who are religious marry young.

Not having any experience at 30 is a death signal. It tells women ""no one wants to be this guy and for most likely a good reason."" Maybe you are physically ugly, maybe you have autism, maybe you are shy, maybe you have a low income job, maybe you still live with your parents.

A woman wants a man who can take care of himself and her. That's why most women will not date someone who makes less than them.

So if you have made it to 30 without ever having as much as a kiss, you are basically so far behind you will never have a healthy organic romantic relationship with a woman ever in your life. That's just the facts.

Start saving up to pay legally for sex because that's the only action you will ever get, period. Because as soon as you pay for sex, you are stuck there. But it is probably better than dying alone and a virgin never having your pee-pee touched.

So, as the title says, I'm 25 years old with a net worth just shy of 700k. 99% of it was gained on crypto, which I cashed out a few months ago, so I have 700k cash sitting in a bank account atm.

I find that the current economic times brought us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest and create generational wealth, so I'm looking to take a more grown-up approach and invest wisely.

So my question is, I'm debating over going 50/50 on stocks and ETFs. For individual stocks, I would go with GOOG, MSFT, NVDA, HD, and one or two more. The rest to put in some global ETF. 

Since most stocks took a beating and had an insane drop in %ytd, what's the play here? All in ETF? Do a 50/50? I tolerate risk fairly well and don't take it into much consideration. Isn't the upside totally worth any risk involved? I know the consensus is ETF and chill. 

The plan is to retire at 45 in a fairly stable way. My income is 1000€ per month in a poor country.

What would be the play here? Keep risking or play it safe?

Also, I don't own a house or any property and don't plan to do it until I have some stability in terms of work. I own a car and since I love cars I don't mind spending 30/40k on one even if it delays retirement down the line.

1141,0,"Hello! I’m 22 years old, still trying to learn about finances, and I have 4 questions that I’m not sure how to ask/ have not seen an answer for. I understand that it is generally recommend to invest in a 401k first, because of matching/ taxes/ higher investment amount, then a Roth IRA because of tax advantages. After that, if you have those maxed out and have money left over, I imagine the rest of your money should go into a regular brokerage account. #1. I don’t understand why it is not best to simply have 1 brokerage account to throw all your money in. For example, if you have $40,000  to invest, ~30k goes in to 401k and Roth, and then 10k goes to the brokerage account. It is my understanding that investments grow exponentially- if you have more money in an account, it compounds more quickly. Wouldn’t it make more sense to throw 40k into one account to allow it to grow exponentially more quickly? The capital gains tax where is live is like 9%. Even with that, I feel like it would end up being more money if you maximized the investment into one account. # 2 if I were to own the same stock in multiple accounts, does that mean anything? If I have VTSAX (or whatever it is) in a 401k and an IRA, is that anything? #3 is JL Collins 80-100% VTSAX and 0-20% bonds sufficiently diversified? It makes sense to me as it’s the whole market, but I feel like I’ve seen online that that is not sufficient diversification and you need global total market too and even both aren’t enough etc.  #4 this one is the most silly, but I feel like I’ve seen online both that you do and do not have to pay income tax on 401k and Roth IRA, so I’m not really sure which one is true.

1165,0,"Hi all. I'm looking to discuss different approaches to FIRE regarding early career investing versus calculated debt payoffs.

My wife and I have a combined income of around $175K yearly in a LCOL. We have virtually zero debt beyond student loans. Student loans are around $100K capped at $500/monthly with 5% interest. This looks due to be even lower thanks to Biden's new plan, maybe $250/monthly?

Over the next 3 years using all of our discretionary income, I'm trying to decide whether it would make more sense to put $100,000 into a taxable investment account, or to pay off student loan(s) completely. At this young age, wouldn't every dollar I save hypothetically be worth 5-10x that by average FIRE age? Is there any reason I should not just keep using an IBR program to infinitely pay such a low monthly?

1167,0,"Hi all.

Combined, my wife and I make around $175K yearly. Currently, my plan has been keeping all other debt at 0 while aggressively putting additional income into retirement accounts and a separate taxable investment account. My logic was with how young we were it naturally made more sense to put money away now with compounding interest. We file married but separate, her IBR is under $500/month and we hardly notice it. It looks like with Bidens changes that could drop even lower, possibly halve, and not accrue interest.

Recently, a few people have told me I'm better off aggressively paying down her student debt. Could anyone please help me understand why this could be better than just letting compound interest do its thing and paying the minimum ibr?

Thank you all very much!","At 29, would prioritizing 75K in ibr student loans over investing in a taxable investment account really benefit me more?"
1168,0,"Hey all! 

So as the title says I'm planning an early retirement to Thailand. It won't be full retirement as I would probably get bored out of my mind. Here's a little background though:

I'm in my early 30s
I've worked for a large consulting firm for some time
Own a business with two partners that is going quite well
I've also opened about 6 businesses in my life plus 4 (one current) were successful
Sold the properties I owned this year and am in the process of liquidating my last few cars

Basically I'm at the point where I'm tired of working for other people and am well off enough or at least have a sustainable enough revenue stream to live off of by moving internationally. I'm planning on moving to Bangkok in July of next year so am starting the process now and had a few questions plus wanted some insight incase someone saw a flaw. 

Moving checklist:
Open thai bank account
Purchase elite visa
Vet check for my dog
Find a condo
Insurance 
Copies of important documents

From a sustainability perspective here's what I'm anticipating for a financial breakdown:

Money in:
Savings: 7 figures but don't plan on dipping into that for a while. 
Disability income: ~$4000
Investment income: +/- $2600 now after selling properties
Business income: we haven't taken an owners draw yet but I was planning to pay myself a modest $8,000 a month. 

Monthly Income loss (quitting): ~$24,000 pretax

Money out:
Rent: ~$3000 (yes you can do it cheaper but I'm looking at a nicer place)
Utilities: $120 rough guess
Phone: $40
Monthly eating/ dining: $20 a day - $600
Entertainment budget: $1200
Misc expenses (slush) - $500

Total - $5,460

So fianances would be $14,600 - 5460 = 9140. Less if I divest my owners draw into simply a savings were at 1140 for personal savings. 

I'm moving to Bangkok for a year maybe 2 then somewhere more remote (Koh Samui possibly) to just relax and get away from it. Will still be comanaging my business's.

Question - how do I handle tax implications with business income? I have a physicsl address in the US still, but will be offshore 100%

1170,0,"Not super familiar with the finer details of FIRE, but have been interested in retiring early from a young age. I'm wondering if anyone has had experience doing a ""mid-life"" retirement. AKA stopping work (or perhaps continuing part time), without all the money needed to permanently retire, but taking 2,3,4,5,10, whatever many years off you can without running completely out of money, with the intention of getting back to work at some point again once funds run lower. 

This largely comes from a place of being sick and tired of full time work, and wanting to make my 20's and 30's while my body is still capable of a lot really count. The biggest concern of course being the ultimate, dreaded return to work. Will I be dreading returning to work, even if it's say 5 years away? Is this a waste of savings? Am I simply too impatient? 

I can't help but wonder of the possibility that I will find something to still make money while I'm in temporary retirement. I'm a super curious person and like to stay busy enough. I've recently looked into proofreading/ editing part time as an option. If I do well enough in the stock market perhaps partial retirement could turn into full retirement, but I obviously shouldn't count on that whatsoever.

1178,0,"I'm a 22M that's been coding since I was 10, lined up a software development job out of HS, in ~3 years became SDE II at Amazon. Total compensation went 90k-115k-125k-260k not including retirement contributions. In total I saved ~$400k, investment growth (happened to almost perfectly time a trade into small value AVUV from VOO which helped a lot) brought me up to my current net worth of $660k.

I got fired from Amazon a few months ago basically because I'm a garbage and defective human being that procrastinates everything to comical lengths thus unable to get any work done. I've looked back and realized I deliver negative value as an employee while personally feeling like shit for doing so, so I'm retiring. I've been trying some other jobs and work arrangements like folks suggested, but the same issues destroyed me every time even trying to work 10 hrs\mo so fuck it, I'm done.

I moved to LCOL and my expenses are staying well within my $28k\yr target. It's pretty easy since all I want to do is play video games and read webtoons, I literally haven't stepped outside in months lol.

[Here's the expense breakdown](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/330538905072041994/1037921166666506250/Screenshot_20221103_212234.png)

All utilities are included in my $825 rent payment, so that's stable. The internet here is pretty great value IDK why, but the $15\mo phone is because I switched to Mint mobile now that I've stopped ever going outside.

I burn $600\mo on food because all of it is delivered from restaurants. I'm the laziest person ever if that wasn't obvious yet.

All my gaming stuff I have rn totaled about $2000 when I bought it 2 years ago, with a 1660ti and i7-9850h which look like they'll handle most stuff coming out for another 3-5 years fairly well. I also got a Galaxy S22 for $700 which is supported for 5 years. I amortize all that to ~$500\yr for a reasonable electronics budget.

The $1250\yr for vacations and $250\yr for clothes is just the average from my adult life, really I'll probably spend less going forward considering I didn't enjoy any of those vacations a whole lot. Healthcare is the most unknown, but according to ACA estimators it should be between free (Medicaid) and $300\yr depending on how much capital gains I realize.

Maid service is only $80\mo because my standards for cleanliness are low enough that I only have it every 6 weeks. Actually at one point I went over a year without cleaning my place at all, only after moving and noticing my allergies? mysteriously disappear did I realize I should spend a little on this if possible lol.

Those with good mental math probably noticed $28k is more than 4% of $660k, and the 4% rule in the first place is quite risky considering how long of a retirement I'm looking at while not even qualifying for Social Security. I explain why it's fine and why I'm really following a 3% SWR [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/xodxgx/daily_fi_discussion_thread_monday_september_26/iq1fep0/).

1208,0,"Since I got into the FIRE journey(getting older and having family as I guess), I have been debating in my mind many times what kind of mindset I should have towards my career. Should I work as hard as I can or just chill out if things are going decent.

I consider myself lucky as I have never been a hard worker but my income increased significantly and quickly . I was able to  increased my salary from 67k as new grad back in 2013 to 160k in 2018 with a fully remote position (Engineering field but not in IT/software). 

So far I have been just chill through my whole career between the top companies in this layback industry. I am currently making 178k total comp and working 25-35hr per week fully remote at home.

Last week I went through the Amazon interview and got a offer from Amazon with about 10% increase of my current total comp. Again, not in software or main business of Amazon but in my same industry. So the work life balance shouldn't be bad but most likely require more effort/hours than my current job. On top of that, it requires quite a bit of travelling: 1 one-week long, 2 two-week long and 1 one-month long travel which will put a lot of work and stress on my wife with two young kids.

I have been thinking all days in the past few days and really struggling to make a decision. Financially, I  don't think it make sense to do it because I probably make less or the same per hour. But on the other hand, it is definitely a step up in my career and will set me up for better in the future or open up other roads in my career. 

I always wonder if our career should be like our investment strategy:  The most boring investment strategy/companies that do the same thing over and over but making money consistently is the best way to go.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some numbers if you are interested:

# FIRE progress 

**I am currently 34 with a wife at 31 and two 5 y/o twins. I am targeting to FIRE by 47(45-50).**

**Total net worth: 1.3 mil**

**Real-estate: 800k equity** 

* 740k primary residence(debt: 420k )
* 540k house parents live in (own by me, debt: 250k)
* 300k rental (debt:95k)

**Total invested: 480k (150k in Roth)**

**Cash: 40k**

&amp;#x200B;

# Current job:

**Total comp:178k**

* Base pay: 138k
* Bonus: 22k
* RSU:7K
* 401k match(6%):10k

**Pro**

* Fully remote
* Prefect manager (can't really think of one bad thing about him)
* very flexible hour(I rarely do work after 2 or 3pm) 
* Very good benefit 25 day PTO, 10 day sick leave.
*  A lot of freedom and opportunity for self learning in term of time, project and resource.
* zero travel

**Con**: slow growth for salary

&amp;#x200B;

# Amazon:

**Total comp: 200k**

* Base pay: 140k
* Cash Bonus: 50k
* RSU:7K
* 401k match(2%):4k

Cash bonus will ramp down and RSU ramp up at the first 4 years to keep the total comp at 200k. Stock price is a factor but I think it is a good timing as the whole market is low now.

**Pro**

* Advance in a career for future job hopping
* Gain new skill (same industry but different and more niche field which should have better job security )
* Looks cool?

**Con**

* A lot of travel (per year): 1x1week + 2 x2week + 1 month
* More working hour and higher stress are expected. after all it is Amazon..
* need to be in office 2 days per week. 1hr commute one way
* less PTO
* probably worse health insurance","Working as hard as you can vs Chill, slow and steady to achieve FIRE [With Family]"

I also ran some simple ROE calculations on my investment properties and it seems they are underperforming a bit more than I had thought (&lt;10%).

 Cashflows $1,500 and mortgage payments are $705. Free cashflow per month is $795. 

I wanted to know if I should pay this off as quickly as possible, or buy more real estate? I've outlined my stats so it paints a picture of my monthly financial situation.

**Here is a breakdown of my income****:**

* Main Source: $4,580 (already after taxes)
* Rental 1: $1,250 (This house is paid off, est. Redfin value $100k)
* Rental 2: $795 (House from above, with mortgage.)

So my income is $6,625.

**Here are my monthly expenses:**

* Groceries: $400
* Gym: $120
* Gas: $150
* Misc: $250

$920 in monthly expenses.

I live at home with my parents rent free, my car is paid off, and I have zero credit card debt. So total **net income after expenses is $5,705.** 

I am 26 years old and I do not drink, do drugs, or use dating apps. I'm fiercely focused on my family, health, and financial situation above all else.

What would be the best way to approach this? Save up to buy another one or pay off this one off as soon as possible? I've only made 1 payment so far on this property.

He limited spending on his hobbies. He seemed happy, but I'm not sure he was living the life he wanted to live while he was living, and I'm sad about that. 

He centered his life around the idea of retiring early and then living the life he really wanted, but won't get to do that.

 Have a 356$/month car payment, pay around 100-200$ a month for insurance(i pay per mile because I have a work vehicle) and spend about 250-300$ a month on food. 

 I spend about 3000$ a month just to live. With around 400-500$ left over each month with just my base pay. 6% is put into my 401k another 15% is put into my savings. 


 I make 30$ an hour but work excessive amounts of overtime in the summer ( in July I worked 80 hours of overtime) 

 I hate renting, it feels like I’m tossing money away every month. I understand that I’m paying for warmth and shelter but I can pay most people’s mortgage with what I pay in rent. I calculate expenses solely based on me working 40 hours a week and overtime is extra and is never budgeted/expected. at this rate with what I’m paying it will take me 10 years before I have a comfortable down payment. and I will of paid 225000 in rent alone. 

 Moving back in with them feels like a step backwards, we have a great relationship, I go over to their house 1-2 times a week. When my previous lease ended they hinted at me moving back in without directly saying it, I’m not sure if they want me to come back home or if they just wanted me to know the option was on the table. Or if they’re only willing because they’re my parents and it’s the socially correct way to treat your child. thoughts? 

 Where is the best place I can put my savings to grow rather than having the money stagnant in my savings account building 0.5% interest. 

 Are there any solid resources you guys would recommend for developing a solid plan. This is the first time I’ve taken money and my future serious and I’m extremely lost.

1252,0,"Family of 4 (2 young children).  Our average expenses per month are $12,000.  It typically wavers anywhere from about $10k per month to $14k for months with unforeseen spending.  This includes everything from business expenses to food to daycare to the mortgage, car payments, insurance, utilities, entertainment, dining.  Literally everything.  

We don't spend a lot of money outside of necessity, which is what really irks me.  We don't have terrible habits, we don't have shopping addictions and since our kids were born we do a pretty minimal amount of traveling.  That's why the idea that we are averaging this much spend per month is so absurd to me.  

We don't have an expensive house (mortgage roughly $2k/mo).  We dont have expensive cars  ($550/mo loan payment).  We try to keep our dining/delivery budget to about $300/mo.  We cook a lot of our own meals.

Our biggest expenses are childcare ($3000/mo) 
Mortgage/PMI/HOA ($2400/mo)
Business expenses (wife is business owner and I also have a small business) ($1000/mo)
Groceries ($1000/mo)
Medical stuff ($800)
Utilities/insurance ($800)
Car payment ($550)
Shopping/kids clothes/necessary items ($500)
Student loans ($400)
Dining/drinks ($350)
Gas ($250)
Drugstore stuff/cleaning/paper towels/etc.($250)
Entertainment ($200)
Software subscriptions/YouTube TV ($150)
Pet/dog costs ($150)
Health/wellness stuff ($100)
Various other small things.  

I know that the $3k in childcare costs will decrease a lot in a year or 2, and then completely go away in about 4 years.  So there's a bright side there.  And in addition, there are some medical bills which will also be paid off in a year.  But apart from that - I feel as though we are pretty disciplined in our lifestyle.  Dealing with colder temperatures by putting a sweater on and using less heat to save $30 a month is such a drop in the bucket that it feels stupid to even worry about.  Spending $100 less here and there on delivery is such a miniscule amount because it's already a small amount.  

I'm genuinely curious what people think about this.  Is this just a ""Yea dude.  You have 2 young kids and it is what it is"" type of thing? Or am I missing something? I'm amazed at the fact that a $200k gross salary is basically just enough to pay the bills.",How on earth is my family spending so much money per month?

Trying to figure out how I stack up against the ""masses."" I'm 32, married, and own a house. Liquid savings/investments = $50k. 401k/IRAs = $180k. Business liquid = $3k. Business assets = $30k.

1265,0,"I've never considered speaking to a financial adviser for usual reasons i.e.  assuming they are there to make money out of me but I'm in a situation where its very hard to be unemotional and would appreciate an independent viewpoint. In this situation is there any value to them? 
Briefly (ok turned out to not be brief at all) . I live with my partner who is a very high earner with zero savings. We are a blended family – he has 3 children and I have 1. We live in an extremely expensive city and due to exs and schools etc we cant leave for at least 10 years. We pay approx 1000 a week on rent and own no property. The rent around us is increasing significantly and in fact we are underpaying around $300 weekly so are expecting a rent increase very soon (or will have to move and therefore find an equivalent house). To buy a house for 6 people will be around 1.5mil + so mortgage around $1770 pw assuming 5%. 

So my situation is that I am an average earner that has saved approx enough for a decent deposit on a 2 bed apartment ( in this city – could buy a house somewhere else) that could house my daughter and I. I also invested steadily in ETFS which I could sell. I did not buy property 6 years ago when I met my partner as assumed we would move in together and buy somewhere. This meant that property prices have increased significantly, and my buying power has been almost destroyed. Meanwhile unfortunately, despite his very high salary he has not managed to save a deposit. Some of this is his fault and some of it is bad luck. For him to match my deposit it will take years and that means house prices will be even higher ( they are dropping a little right now but due to increased interest rates still crazy $$)  

 So, my issue is this what to do now? If we stay renting in this city prices will increase annually. If we buy a 4 /5 bedroom house I will have to use my entire life savings as a deposit, which to be honest makes me incredibly nervous. It’s taken me years and a lot of discipline to get to this point. It will, however, give me a stake in a house that I would never be able to afford normally. We do not have joint finances due to the blended situation ( and TBH some resentment from me around being the saver when he earns so much) so I don't know where I could start with trying to work out who pays what. He of course due to his larger income and more kids would pay a much larger proportion of the mortgage (and of course I would never get this kind of mortgage without his income but equally he could not without my deposit) Having been divorced once I am loath to risk it all again but equally, I don’t want to continue renting / leave my amazing, noisy, new family. So I guess I need advice re should I buy an IP outside of this city that I can leave to my daughter / and that I or hopefully we can retire in one day. Or should I throw it all in with my partner and accept that even with a small deposit that it's better than renting and it will hopefully increase in value over the years.

1293,0,"I recently started on the mega back door path and thought I made a mistake when I chose After-tax to Roth In Plan Conversions. However my plan allows in service withdrawals and Fidelity told me that whether they are After-Tax or Roth-In-Plan-Conversions (RIPCs), either are eligible for in service withdrawals however traditional and Roth 401(k) monies are not eligible. For whatever reason, they track Roth 401(k) and RIPC monies separately.

Anyway, I have to transfer those monies (after-tax or RIPC) to a Roth IRA manually but I can do it every paycheck if I want to. However, and this was made very clear to me, both of these monies would be counted as “conversions” in my Roth IRA and NOT “contributions.” So there wouldn’t be any benefit for me to not do automatic RIPCs as far as I can tell. In fact, RIPCs would be better because they are performed automatically with no potential of taxable earnings generated. So if that’s the case then I just need to perform a single RIPC to Roth IRA rollover every year to set up the ladder. Right?

The Fidelity guy, although very knowledgeable, didn’t know if “conversions” count as “contributions” in terms of whether they would be subject to early withdrawal penalties.

But that’s what the whole Roth ladder really depends on, doesn’t it? If conversions didn’t count as contributions then you’d be subject to the penalties?

1305,0,"Hello everyone. 

I [33M] am currently a renter. I did own a home but I sold it last year. I no longer lived in the area, had no interest in being a landlord, and it had doubled in value since I had bought it. 

I see interest rates rising. If home values drop enough or if I see something I really like, I may decide to buy instead of renting.  

I know that many people who buy homes in a high-interest environment get a mortgage, pay a premium while they wait for rates to drop, and then refinance.

My question is, can you buy all-cash, wait for rates to come down, and then get a mortgage? Does it ever make sense to do this? Are the interest rates different when you put a mortgage on a home later vs when you buy it?

The other thing that's hard to predict assuming this approach is possible is if it's financially beneficial. If I sink $500k into a home while I wait for mortgage rates to come down, how much could I have made in the meantime by parking that money in index funds? How much would I save my not having a mortgage while the rates are high?

Any advice would be great. Thanks!",Buying a home with cash
1306,0,"Hi, I am 31 and have no debt other than the mortgage (320k left) with 2.875% interest. Right now I and my wife make $170k year and we are able to save almost 60% of our after tax income.

1315,0,"I've been interested in FIRE from pretty early on in my career. I worked in Insurance/Finance and while I'm good at it, I am not passionate about it, and I have a lot of hobbies that I can easily devote 100+% of my time to.

The company I was working for laid me off yesterday, and while my true FIRE number is a bit higher than where I'm at today, I have enough to take a very long break or to supplement my savings with side-gigs or part-time work.

I'm looking forward to being able to focus full-time on my hobbies as well as to connect more with friends and family (I haven't been terrible at this, but I could do better). I enjoy climbing, chess and running, and have a few goals related to those hobbies. Rough goals are:

-Climb a 5.13 by the end of next year (currently ~12c, but have sent 12d within the past few years)
-Place well in the U1800 section at the World Open in 2023 (I won U1500 at the North American Open and tied for 4th in the North American Open within the past 2 years)
-Run a trail 50k next year

I used to stream on twitch for SC2 before I began my career (back in 2012). I'd love to be able to supplement my savings with some income through that, but have no concrete plans at the moment. Perhaps there's still space for some chess content :)

The numbers:

Assets:
-50k Cash (TBD on how much I want to keep in cash vs. invested at any point in time)
-400k Brokerage Account
-200k 401k

Debt:
-350k Mortgage @ 2.8%, home is worth ~525k

Expenses/Budget:
-1,000 for home costs net of rent (I have two roommates and have room for a 3rd if I need to cut back expenses)
-350 groceries
-150 eating out
-250 phone bill/gym membership/car insurance
-150 gas
-TBD Health Insurance

Assuming health insurance ends up being $300/mo, this puts me at 26,400 in necessary expenses every year. At a 4% withdrawal rate on my more liquid accounts, I have 18,000 to work with. So technically not quite FIRE, but I only need to make 8,400 doing to cover those costs, plus maybe 2-3k to cover things like vacations, entertainment, replacing outdoor equipment, etc.

I'm excited to see how this goes. Worst case scenario I'll have to take a huge pay cut (probably still &gt;$100k) and return to work in a few years. I'll make some follow-up posts here in the following years!",(Coast/Lean?) FIRE'd Yesterday!

1353,0,"I've recently been re-evaluating retirement saving and taxes in general after taking a higher paying job. I've been a long time Dave Ramsey listener, and have always heard that you should prefer Roth (IRA or 401k) accounts because they grow tax free. The logic being that the growth will be much larger than the initial investment for most retirement time horizons.

But... \[I put together a spreadsheet to verify this logic\]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1utdqhLv-TmoAYDai9etHkx70sQHZe8cLee-WDnDEMC0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1utdqhLv-TmoAYDai9etHkx70sQHZe8cLee-WDnDEMC0/edit?usp=sharing)). If you assume that you use the tax savings to invest the total amount (ie you invest $10k with the traditional account but only $7.6k with the Roth) and that the tax rate will be the same (big assumption I know), the end safe withdrawal amount ends up being exactly the same.

So on the surface it would seem that it is just a matter of if you think your tax rate will be higher or lower in retirement. But when you make contributions to a Roth account, you're effectively being taxed at your highest tax bracket. Even if your tax bracket largely remained the same, when you withdraw from a retirement account you would at least pay a lower tax rate on the first brackets worth of income.

1377,0,"I'm starting a sabbatical in just a few days, which may turn into a longer form ""retirement.""  We'll just have to see how it goes.

We have about 3.5M in various savings/assets, and about $100k/year living expenses.  Ages 46/42.

While unconventional, I'm considering taking advantage of the very generous TIPS rates right now (Inflation + 1.72% on 30 year) and locking in about 2.6M in TIPS (which would put me at a 25/75 equity/bond split.)

Here's my logic.  Let's assume 0% inflation to keep things easy.  (That works, because TIPS should cancel out the effects of inflation.)

Year 1.  2.650M in bonds pays out 45,580 in interest.  Sell $54k of the bonds.  

Year 2.  2.595M in bonds pays out $44,644 in interest.  Sell $55k of the bonds.

Year 3.  2.54M in bonds pays out $43,600 in interest.  Sell $56k of bonds.

When also accounting for Social Security payments, this would hit the bottom of the bucket at about age 100. 

I'd still have about 800k growing in the market from day 1 (my 25% equity portion).

Pros/Cons/Risks:  

Pro:   Nearly guaranteed.  Can spend up to my yearly amount without fear.  No concerns about market fluctuations or inflation eroding spending power.  Would have the side bucket of equities for legacy/heirs or splurges.

Con:  Very little upside.  I'd have a 100k lifestyle -- but would never have ""multi-million dollar"" means.  (But I'm not really much of a spender anyway.)  Taxes would eat a bit, but not much, since my ""married filing jointly"" taxable income from the bonds would be very low.

Risks:  The biggest risk here is longevity.  I have to plan for about 54 years of potential life remaining (we can only hope).  However, the longest TIPS bond term is 30 years.  So the biggest glaring risk here is that TIPS rates will be low (or negative) 30 years from now.  In 30 years, I would have about 886k in today's dollars remaining.  Assuming a SPIA in a low rate environment, I could probably get $30-40k/year guaranteed (not adjusted for inflation) + Soc Security + my bucket of side money as a safety net.  

I suppose there is also risk in hanging my hat on Social Security.  But hopefully I'm at an age now where that risk of non-payment or reduced payments is lower than it would be if I were younger.

Aside from that, we have about $600,000 saved, most of it in CD’s and a 403b earning around 3%.  Our lifestyle is modest, although we do like to travel some—lower budget trips abroad a couple of times a year.  I already feel somewhat foolish for cutting my salary in half and am afraid of how I’ll feel with no salary.  I know I can’t take it with me, but the possibility of guilt and worry are very real given my way of thinking.  Any advice?",Am I ok to retire?

1384,0,"My husband was killed in a road traffic collision 3.5 years ago. Thankfully he had a death in service benefit which paid the mortgage off the house so I've been mortgage free since then which has allowed me to continue working part time while caring for our two young children now 6 and 4. My part time wage as a teacher just about covers our monthly expenditure with me occasionally having to dip into savings to cover birthday parties etc. I have an emergency fund of 3 months expenses which is averaging about £1.5k/month this includes me saving about £300 a month into s and s isa. 

On to the question. I'm coming to the end of the civil suit and the negligent driver's insurance company have offered me £850k. This will be a one time payment and is meant to last for lifetime that was lost. This lump sum would take me out of the wealth generating stage and  securely into building. My question is with interest rates at what they are would it be best to pop it in savings rather than investments as long term savings rates are now around 5% which would see me clear of the 4% withdrawal rate? I haven't been deeply risk adverse with the money I invest monthly which is in an index tracker but find myself decidedly more cautious with this lump sum because I want the children to have experiences as it's the last thing their dad can do for them. I anticipate my monthly expenses rising to £2k to accommodate this.

I am scared to take the plunge and retire seeing the runaway inflation happening worldwide. All the major safe plays like MF, Index funds, etc are no longer keeping up with inflation and I feel like the most hurt by this are the people who have savings (like us).

Currently, I earn about 105-115K depending on bonuses. This new role will provide the opportunity to earn more commission.

When I was first brought into the organization I was given a pretty hefty sign on bonus, is there opportunity have another sign on bonus with accepting a new job at the same organization?

In addition, I have direct experience connections and will require have to training of an outside higher - all valuable items to the employer that cut their cost as well. I’m not sure what the salary range is for this position as it is pretty tight lipped, however, due to my age, I feel as if I will be on the lower end. I will be by far the youngest territory manager in the entire organization by about a decade. 

I am honored to be considered and excited about the opportunity, but can’t help but feel that they are exploiting my age a little bit , as I have been a top producer in the last two years, I feel I will carry this out and just want to get a fair shake.

The scary thing is that over that time, I have run into a great number of health issues (mental and physical) that have cost me thousands of dollars. Between groceries (I eat very clean), other health adaptations, and actual medical costs, I believe my health is now costing me $20k per year. I have had no other notable lifestyle inflation outside of an acceptable range.

Early in my journey, I always told people that my biggest reason for seeking FI was to have to say no to the best health care for myself or my family because I couldn’t afford to pay for it.

Currently, I look at my expenses while shifting careers and stress over how I’ll be able to cover all my expenses and still save.

The truth is that because of all the hard work I put in early, my “savings” are now producing savings for me, and my earnings can provide for me and my health where I need it. 

FI has a variety of meanings to different people. And to me, it has meant freedom to choose to put myself and my health first.

1406,0,"I am contemplating a career move and have been interviewing with several companies.

I am just wondering if I am making a reasonable step for my family from a financial perspective. I won't go into too much detail with regards to location or career.

Old job: LCOL city, family friendly, remote job. Current salary about 120k + 10% equity + 3% 401k match + 5% target bonus (I have never received less than a 5/5 rating though, which is associated with a 12% bonus). TCO that I calculated is about 150k.

New job: MCOL city, larger city can be family friendly. Non remote job. Salary will likely be around 145k + 20% target bonus + 34k x 4 years sign on bonus (I am not sure if I misheard this - maybe 34k in 4 years?).

From a compensation and career growth perspective, I think the new job fits better.

Thing is... I have a 2.5 year old and a 3 month old at home. We just bought a 500k house last year at 3% interest, and I have a rental bought at 225k @ 3.5% interest rate (+500 / month cashflow, before repairs). Moving means I will likely sell these two properties and take a loss. Not to mention the new job is in TX so property tax is very high (looking at increase from 3k to 9k per year I think).

My goal is to keep going to eventually amass an obscene amount of wealth during my lifetime to make sure my children, grandchildren and perhaps the generation after that do not need to choose their profession based on the need to provide themselves with a good quality of life. So they would be free to pursue professions that they desire without it having to be a profession that pays well.

1423,0,"**Background**

I am a late 40s professional living and working in Singapore (born and bred), married with no children. 

**Financial situation**

I currently make about S$400,000 a year (US$258,000) post tax , and my net assets are worth about S$2.8m (US$2m), with my principal assets being S$1.5m in global equities/bond ETFs, S$400,000 in a Singapore STI ETF and the rest in a mixture of some bond funds and cash instruments. 

My wife earns less than me, but she's more of a saver and has about the same amount of retirement assets as me. So we have about US$4m as a family. 

The above excludes the net value of my primary residence (about US$2m) and mandatory government savings scheme (CPF). 

Long and short, we are probably financially independent-ish today, based on our fairly frugal lifestyle. I say independent-ish because even though the nest egg may look comfortable to some, if we have to live off savings today, we have to fund quite a long retirement period of 40 years or more, unlike say someone who retires later at 65 and has to fund a shorter (20 years shorter) retirement period. This substantially longer period introduces far more uncertainty into the equation. Given that a fair amount of my net worth is exposed to the equities markets, and the current market turmoil, I am also exposed to potentially substantial variations in my assets.

**My job**

For privacy, I won't go into details, but I've been doing my job for a substantial period of time, and I have seniority and status in my position. I generally call the shots within my role and have very little interference from my boss. I have a small team reporting to me, and am comfortable with the responsibilities placed on me. The job is stable and I do not fear retrenchment or downsizing. My hours are extremely reasonable and the actual job requirements are not demanding beyond my ability. 

The above are the admittedly substantial upsides. However, as should be obvious since I'm writing this post, there are downsides to my job. 

\- The organisation is dysfunctional and in order to cope with what happens, I generally have to ignore it and not attempt to fight it. This is a function of the organisation's ownership and corporate culture. These overall cultural idiosyncrasies create frequent stress points for me, in frustration about management weaknesses, dealing with incompetent colleagues who have found a niche in this organisation and extreme inefficiences in how we operate.  I also feel extremely mis-aligned with the purpose and culture of the organisation and feel that this is an entirely transactional relationship, where I don't get, nor expect, anything more than a pay cheque. I don't get job satisfaction nor feel that I am fulfilling any other purpose, than to fatten my retirement portfolio.

\- Given my role as a control function, the small size of my team and no meaningful deputy to rely on, I find it hard to switch off from my job. This is not to say I have to respond to emails or check on things 24/7, but due to my personality, I have never been able to mentally switch off. I do not enjoy vacations or time off, as I find it extremely stressful to think about leaving the role unattended for any meaningful amount of time. Given the number of years that I have not been able to switch off, this has snowballed and has affected my mental health. 

\- With (a) the misalignment between my organisation and my aspirations, and (b) the long period of not being able to switch off, I have been exhibiting classic signs of burn out and depression for some time now, and have difficulty enjoying anything anymore. I am quick to anger and pre-judge people and situations, and occasionally take out my frustrations on colleagues and others. I am neglectful of my family's needs and, given that I am generally reserved and introverted, any time I don't spend on work is time I want to spend alone. So I spend extremely little time with family or friends, or checking up on them. This ironically also snowballs into additional stress for me, as I feel guilty in how I am neglectful. 

**Sabbatical / early retirement / career pivot**

I have found myself thinking more and more about taking a break, and have less and less patience about doing my job. I am thinking of taking a sabbatical to take time off to rest, and emerge from the cocoon that I have been in. 

I am fortunate in that I can fund quite a number of years of my living expenses without working, but I am not certain that even if I can, that this is what I want to. I would also feel more comfortable with some more 'padding' added to my retirement portfolio, both in terms of reducing the number of years I will need to fund, and also adding to the nest egg. Even doing one (reducing the number of years I will need to fund by working a lower paying job that pays for my daily expenses) will meaningfully go towards my financial security. 

An alternative is that I take time off to explore other ways to spend my time meaningfully, including to pivot my career into something else entirely, which gives me more purpose on a day to day basis. Honestly, though, I have no idea what this might be. 

**Sabbatical cons**

Given the above, I am thinking of taking a sabbatical. The main 'cons' of doing so, in my mind, are as follows:

\- **Sabbatical not solving anything.** I am concerned that taking a sabbatical won't solve anything and that what I really need is an attitude adjustment. But given my current mental state, I am not sure whether I can do anything about the attitude adjustment. Alternatives to a sabbatical are (a) to find another job and negotiate a break before I start work or (b) stay where I am and try harder to 'zen out' and to fix the issues I am facing, like hiring a number 2 to take some of the load off. 

\- **Not being able to find a job when I want to come back.**  With the current economic uncertainty, inflation eroding my nest egg faster than it grows and possible recession, I am worried that if, at the end of the sabbatical, I want to come back to full time work, I won't be able to. Or that I panic and before I am ready to, I jump back into another similar job and am back to square one. To caveat, given my skills and experience, I am fairly comfortable that I will be able to find another job (even if I have to earn less), despite my age, but who knows? 

\- **CV gap.** Less off a concern is explaining to my new employer the gap in my CV, but I think this should be less of a concern given that I have more than 20 years of solid employment experience, other than this sabbatical. 

**Does the above resonate with you and did you face any similar challenges? How did you resolve (or not resolve) them? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!**",Sabbatical as part of the Fire Journey

I do not understand how they come to this conclusion. All you need to live is a place to sleep, food and health insurance.  You can easily achieve that in pretty much every country of the world with 1 Million dollars in my opinion.

For example you could invest all in the REIT ""Realty Income Corporation"" and you would get 48.700 dollars per year right now. This is around 133 dollars per day. Lets say half of that goes to insurance and rent, you still have 60 dollars to spend every day. This is easily enough for **one** person. With a family it would be more difficult, but still doable in many countries of the world. Even many european countries. There are so many people earning less than 4000 dollars per month and they still can enjoy life. (By the way I live in a country that has no tax on dividends and capital gains)

Another way would be to just buy a condo for like 500.000 Dollars and then invest the remaining 500.000 Dollars in something like REIT ""Realty Income Corporation"". Or buy two condos and rent one of them to others.

For 500.000 you could even get a house/villa in many countries of the world. For example I looked at prices in Dubai and you would be shocked to see what 500.000 gets you there in terms of real estate.

I just dont see how 1 Million wouldnt be enough for one person. Even in the west.

I personally want to work one more year and then retire with 1 Million at age 30. I cant take the constant stress anymore. I earn so much money but I wouldnt say it made me any happier. Since I have a business, I will probably still earn quite a bit passively for the next few years after retiring, so I dont have to withdraw money from my investments right away. The things I enjoy the most are for free or very cheap, like being in nature, sports, gaming, socializing, reading books. Even traveling can be quite cheap if you do it right.

I have no need to buy expensive clothes or cars. I couldnt care less about luxury or impressing others, I just want freedom.

Also I will inherit the house of my parents, which is at least worth 1 Million dollars. I hope this will be far in the future, but at some point my parents will die. They are 64 yo right now. I dont see how I could run out of money.",Why do some people say 1 Million isnt enough to retire?

1434,0,"I went to art school, and graduated in 2010 with a degree in Interactive Development and Game Design. I managed to land myself an internship at a startup game developer, which turned into a full-time job as a junior game designer. I started at $55k. 

After a while, I decided (unwisely, in retrospect) to quit my entry-level job and try to pursue a career as a freelance game developers. This was back when indie games were really taking off, and I thought maybe I could do it too. 

At first, things went well. I got a contract job as an artist for a game company, which allowed me the freedom to work from home and work on developing my own game in my spare time.

Things started going badly after that. I realized I was dealing with major depression and social anxiety, and began drinking more heavily. I continued working on my contract job, but my attempts to develop my own game went nowhere.

Eventually it got to the point where I felt lost. I tried going out for some interviews to get back into a game studio but they didn't go well. Truth be told, I gave up fairly easily and fell back on my contract job to make ends meet.

Eventually, though, the contract ended and I was unable to replace the work. I was forced to start picking up odd jobs, which was a big blow to my ego and self esteem. I worked at a supermarket and as a concierge and as a dog walker. This went on for years until I had more or less given up on my game development / game artist career.

Things got worse before they got better. I fell deeper into depression and alcohol. I eventually found some work as a graphic designer and more odd jobs as an artist. I also moved to a state with a much lower cost of living. I was able to scrape by on about $2,000 / $2,500 a month.

I kept trying to figure out a way to get back on a proper career path, but I feel like I keep fizzling out before I can focus on any path long enough to make meaningful progress. 2D Art, graphic design, game design, animation, other random skillsets - never really going deep enough to become competitive or hire-able in that niche.

Then I got a random windfall a little over a year ago. I made a $2,000 crypto investment back in 2017 and thought I had been locked out of, and was unable to recover my account. Fortunately they changed their account recovery backend and years later I was able to recover my investment. ""Overnight"" I made $65,000. This was right before crypto crashed in December 2021. 

I tried to do my best with it, and took most of it out and put it into savings and Betterment. I unfortunately left some if it in crypto and painfully watched the value collapse. I used some of it to pay off the rest of my car and some of it for some unexpected vet bills for my dog which amounted to $4,000. 

Now I'm left with around $21,000, zero debt, and a fully paid off car.

However, I still have zero idea what the fuck I'm doing with my career. I have a part time job that pay surprisingly well, but it is little more than a stop gap measure. Occasionally I'll do design jobs or art jobs for random amounts of money $50 here, $75 there, but it is inconsistent and infrequent.

I'm not sure how to translate the photoshop, illustration, and design skills I have back into a full-time job. So much time has passed, so much regret and shame has built up around my feelings of failure, I don't know how to shake it and get a clear direction for my future.

Sometimes I think I should totally start over and try to pursue a more lucrative career out of a hat, like data analysis or sales. However it feels foolish to abandon the skills and experience that I've already built up for something brand new.

Does anyone here have advice on getting my shit together ""late' in life? Has anyone else dealt with losing their way in their late twenties / early thirties, and how they found a way forward? I don't want to make a ton of money, I just want to have a respectable job that gives my life a sense of direction and purpose.

Thank you in advance for any help and advice.",I am 34 and I don't know what the hell I'm doing with my career path.
