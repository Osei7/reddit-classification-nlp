When I graduated in 2019 with net worth of -14k I remember feeling very stressed and nervous and told myself I will do everything possible to never feel financially stressed ever again, I am proud to say over the course of 3 work years I have got myself into a somewhat comfortable situation. 

Current financial stats:

3year Average Salary - 90k

Student Loan - 10k 
Retirement - 30k 
Personal Investment (fidelity) - 17k
HSA - 6.5k 
High Yield Savings - 45k
12-month CD - 8k
Crypto - 2.6k
Fixed Living Costs (rent, insurance, phone bills etc..) - ~ 1.6k (no food included) 

I realize I have a lot of cash stashed. I am waiting to see how this year plays out to invest more of it. Regardless I think I feel comfortable leaving 30k in HYS as an emergency fund for 1- year possible unemployment situation. I am in a HCOL area (Cali), I don‚Äôt know if i should stash more money away to get ready for a condo purchase that cost around 400k. This goal may take a lot more saving for a few years if I want to keep the 1-year emergency fund. Thoughts?",29M graduated in 2019 and I am 1k away from net worth of 100k!!,1673557670

Thank you to all who commented in the Daily Thread -- there were some great ideas there. 

I dislike my job and don‚Äôt like working as much as everyone else on this sub, but I‚Äôm here for different reasons than a lot of other people: there‚Äôs a 50% chance I‚Äôll die of (familial) ALS. There are tests, but for now I‚Äôve decided not to get them; I don‚Äôt want kids for reasons beyond genetics, so that takes away one of the big motivators to get tested. For me, traditional early retirement is certainly a goal, but my primary goal is being able to walk away from paid work and afford in-home care for the rest of my life the day I get that diagnosis. 

This makes my FIRE planning kind of complicated. I have to plan for both the ""Standard FI"" and ""Terminal RE"" scenarios, but I also know if I get to ""Standard FI"" I'll be extremely lucky. 

What changes to your FIRE plan would you make if you were in my shoes? Is there anything else unique to my situation I should be considering?

Numbers are approximate.

**Background**

Late 20s with a spouse, toddler and dog. Another baby is on the way. Got married in early 20s, we both started off with little or negative net worth. Lived in MCOL and LCOL places. 

**Gross Income**

* 2017: 30k Part time work for both of us. Had cheap housing
* 2018: 55k
* 2019: 55k
* 2020: 110k 
* 2021: 90k
* 2022: 95k

**Net Worth**

At end of year

* 2017: 0 ish
* 2018: 2k
* 2019: 4k
* 2020: 55k
* 2021: 75k
* 2022: 97k
* 1/12/23: 100k!

**Current Net Worth Breakdown**

Cash: 12k  
Retirement Accounts: 56k  
Home Equity: 32k (calculated as purchase price - mortgage, not counting any appreciation)

No debts besides mortgage (15 year at 2.5%)

**Random Tidbits**

* I am very thankful for the privileges that I have had. My parents helped pay for college, so I graduated with a bachelor's degree debt free.
* We paid for the last 2 years of my wife's college, taking on some student loans. We paid cash for my masters degree. 
* I am learning to be content and happy with my situation. When I take a step back, I have it made. I have a great job that pays well and I work from home. My spouse is able to stay home with our kid. I have a spacious house and so many other luxuries. 
* We've been a 1 car family since we've been married and saved a lot of money. I was lucky to be able to walk/bike/take transit for my commutes until I switched to remote. We started out with a 6k used car that my spouse had just bought, ran it to the ground and then bought a 7k car that was well maintained from a family member. 
* My spouse and I have fought a lot about finances. They grew up somewhat poor and didn't want to continue living as frugal now that they finally had money. I am naturally very frugal. We tried Mint to track stuff, didn't work well. Then we kind of stopped tracking and just tried to spend from a pot of money after bills and savings were accounted for. I like spreadsheets, my spouse never looked at them and I had a hard time giving up control. A few months ago we switched to a hybrid cash envelope system and using a money book that we track everything in. It's been great. My spouse has gotten much more involved and it feels like we are a team and can both see where the money is going and how much we have left to spend. My advice: keep trying until you find a system that works for you.
* Discovered the FIRE community around 2017 and I soaked up everything I could. I realized the boring middle can hit pretty fast. I have enjoyed all I've learned the last few years and am trying to not focus so much on finances and just live.

28,financialindependence,"To clarify, I ""failed"" at FIRE because I ended up going back to work almost a year after I pulled the trigger and quit. I consider myself BaristaFIRE because I'm working part-time (80% FTE) for the health insurance benefits and to reach a higher FIRE number. 

Some thoughts now that I've been BaristaFIRE for over a year now (SO remains unemployed, although staying home to care for our twin toddlers is arguably a much harder job than mine where I sit on a computer all day):

* We likely pulled the trigger too early, as we were probably still in leanFIRE territory with lots of big unknown/future expenses (still looking to buy a house, baby #3 on the way, etc) 
* Working from home for 8 hrs/day from Monday thru Thursday has been great for work-life balance, especially since I moved into a lower individual contributor role with no direct reports and hardly any meetings - I have plenty of time to eat breakfast/lunch with our kids, read to them and play with them, and help with cleanup
* With that said, I would still prefer having no job versus a part-time job - I'd like to be a fully present parent for my kids like I was during the time period before I went back to work
* Having a job/salary should hopefully make it easier to get a mortgage, rather than having to try other methods like an asset-based loan, or liquidating a large portion of my taxable brokerage to pay for a house in all cash 
* It's a huge load off my mind to have W2 income for expenses instead of drawing down from our nest egg, i.e. not having to switch from saving mode to spending mode
* Our retirement portfolio is allowed to grow since it remains untouched, which helps to fund regular/chubby FIRE and future/unknown expenses, aka I probably also suffer from One More Year syndrome
* Since I'm still at my high-paying gig, my income allows me the ability to max out my 401k/HSA/IRAs and have enough left over to cover expenses 
* Health insurance costs through my employer are relatively predictable as the premiums, deductible, and OOP Max have remained mostly the same (or with slight increases) over the years
* Our current healthcare coverage is suitable for our needs - we prefer an out-of-state health system which is unfortunately out-of-network for our state's ACA plans
* While this job is great, I know that it won't last forever, so I'm trying to enjoy it as much as I can (I have no problem saying 'no' and for the most part, I can influence my boss to steer work away from my direction, but who knows if/when they'll make a decision to force me to go full time, or my boss leaves and gets replaced by someone really bad, or a reorganization or layoff happens) 
* Before I had kids, I was super ambitious and wanted to climb the corporate ladder as quickly as possible. Now that I have kids, I'm grateful to have a really chill job, but sometimes my pre-kids mentality creeps in and I start thinking about going for those higher roles again. I'm still working through this, but my rational brain knows that now is not the time to add work to my plate, with two toddlers running around and a new baby on the way. If I'm not FIREd by the time they're all school age, then maybe that might be a more appropriate time to start seeking new positions","Failed at FIRE, now currently BaristaFIRE",1673459038

49,financialindependence,"Hello!

It seems like question posts are being moved out of the daily thread, so I'm posting this at top level. Let me know if this really does belong in the daily and I'll repost accordingly.

I'm considering whether to contribute to the mega backdoor Roth or, contrary to advice often cited here, send savings beyond my traditional 401K, (backdoor) Roth IRA, and HSA directly to taxable instead. I'm very early in career (age 23, have been working full time for less than a year). I'm totally blind and am pursuing FI in case some potential hearing issues later in life make me unemployable.

While my company offers the mega backdoor Roth (big tech), I imagine that at this stage, much of the value from these early contributions will come from gains rather than principle. I was considering setting up substantially equally periodical payments (SEPP) should I need to retire before age 59.5 and access this account, but this seems disadvantageous from a tax perspective (taxed on earnings and withdrawal at ordinary income rate, as opposed to long-term capital gains on withdrawal from a brokerage). Am I really better off giving up this tax-advantaged space and contributing to a regular brokerage account, assuming pre-59.5 withdrawal?

68,financialindependence,"***tl;dr - needed a thoughtful way to let my wife know we spent way too much $ on clothes in 2022, so built*** [a slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sf51OaJ0OShKmbj16d0Nec20UimfP6raA4d-td44KXU/edit#slide=id.g1d21173a877_0_0) ***for her. Okay I'm kidding about the clothes part... sort of...***

(We're a 38M / 38F dual-income household with two young kids in a VHCOL area.)

I'm the one that has always kept track of the numbers in our household, and like most in the FI community, I track our NW fairly closely, have us heavy into VTSAX/VTI, etc. My wife has always trusted me to handle our finances and has never really gotten into the weeds with me.

With thoughts and concerns of a rough 2023 swirling in my head, I recently did an analysis of our household spending in 2022, and while I knew our spending had gone up significantly over the last couple years, primarily due to a home purchase and a couple large home improvement projects, I was still taken aback at just how much our other discretionary spending had increased.

While my wife is no spendthrift (she and I have both played equal roles in letting lifestyle creep seep in over the last few years), I needed a way to catch her up and point out the ""opportunity"" before us in a non-confrontational way. Past conversations we'd had around $ hadn't gone particularly well -- I'd pull up our Personal Capital account and start walking her through various charts and graphs, all while espousing the merits of FI, and it was just information overload.

(Side note, I am a huge fan of Personal Capital as an aggregation/NW tracking tool. I've never used their advisory services so can't speak to that.)

So, in an attempt to frame our situation in a more constructive and collaborative way, and per my wife's request (believe it or not), I put some slides together to walk her through an end-of-2022 financial recap for our family. (I'm a mgmt consultant by day, so basically crank slides out for a living.) . Sharing it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sf51OaJ0OShKmbj16d0Nec20UimfP6raA4d-td44KXU/edit?usp=sharing) in case anyone wants to steal the format. It includes our actual 2022 numbers (let the cries of ""why'd you buy such an expensive house?!?"" begin!)

Anyone else in a situation where your partner takes perhaps a more lackadaisical approach to household finances than you'd like? Curious to know how others have gotten on the same page with their partners without causing friction, as the idea of building a financial slide deck every holiday season isn't all that appealing to me üòÖ.

72,financialindependence,"Wife and I are DINKs in a HCOL area and are thinking about buying a house to create housing cost stability as we approach FI. I'd like to share our stats/situation to make sure we aren't making any big mistakes.

* Gross income: $360k
* Expenses: $110K (credit cards paid off monthly)
* Cash: $630k (600k in HYSA earning 3-4%. 30k in checking). We plan to put $500K as a down payment on the house. The remainder will be an E-fund.
* Investments: $900k
   * 401k: $540k in low-cost index funds (90/10 allocation)
   * IRA: $145k in VTSAX
   * Taxable: $145k in VTSAX
   * HSA: $45k in VTSAX
   * Vested RSU: $21k (I usually sell upon vest but keeping some for now as we don't need the money imminently and the stock is way down along w/ everything else.)
   * Bitcoin: $1k (this was a gift. I regret not selling, but just letting it ride since it's a drop in the bucket and theoretically has big upside)

FIRE calculators expect we can FIRE in 4 years if we keep this up. I don't know that we will as I explain below.

Homes that have everything we want in this area go for \~$1M (SFH, safe, good schools, near nature).

If I set my range from 900k-1.1M, I'm looking at a monthly payment of 4k-5k. If both of us keep working, that is tenable. However, if one of us stays home when we have kids, our income gets cut in half, and our housing costs become 33% of our gross income. That's at the very top of the recommended range and makes me feel nervous.

The other factor is I have no idea how to budget for increased child expenses.

80,financialindependence," A recession is a period of economic downturn, typically defined as a decline in GDP (gross domestic product) for two or more consecutive quarters. During a recession, businesses may experience decreased demand for their products or services, leading to layoffs, reduced profits, and other financial challenges. Consumers may also feel the impact of a recession through reduced income, increased unemployment, and a general sense of economic uncertainty. While recessions can be difficult for individuals and organizations, they are a normal part of the economic cycle and are often followed by periods of growth and expansion. 

How to prepare for recession?

 

There are several steps that individuals and organizations can take to prepare for a recession:

1. Build up an emergency fund: Having a financial cushion can help you weather financial setbacks and unexpected expenses. Aim to save enough to cover at least three to six months of living expenses.
2. Reduce debt: Paying off high-interest debt and limiting new borrowing can make you more financially resilient and better able to weather a recession.
3. Diversify your investments: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified investment portfolio can help mitigate the impact of market downturns.
4. Review your budget: Take a close look at your spending and see where you can cut back. Identifying areas where you can reduce expenses can give you more flexibility if your income is reduced during a recession.
5. Consider building up your skills: During a recession, it may be harder to find a job or get a raise. Consider taking a course or getting additional training to make yourself more marketable and increase your earning potential.
6. Stay informed: Keep an eye on economic indicators and stay informed about potential risks. This can help you make informed decisions about your finances.
7. Seek help if you need it: Don't be afraid to reach out for help if you are struggling financially. There may be resources available to assist you, such as unemployment benefits, financial assistance programs, or counseling services.",How To Stay Financially Fit During A Recession - BICHEP,1673282606
81,financialindependence,"Here's a twist on the age old debate to keep a cheap mortgage or pay it down...

Seeking some community perspective on the Ministerial Housing Allowance--MHA--if any of you know about it...This is for a family member. I'm using a throwaway to not make sure they're not identifiable.

Their net worth is a hair over 1M. Two incomes, just under 200K or so total. Maxing 401Ks, RIRAs, 529s for state tax deduction, plus some additional savings in brokerage, totalling maybe 80-95K, so about 40-50% savings rate. So they consider themselves near FI, sort of LeanFI now. They don't anticipate retiring for at least four years, and they could imagine working as many as 10 more years. They are in their mid-40s.

Lots of current spend is giving and temporary expenses and large discretionary spending. Their essential spending is maybe 36K, including home insurance and taxes (5900/yr total), but NOT including Principal and Interest.

So here's the deal. The mortgage P&amp;I is 1400/mo (16,800/yr). Rate is 2.5% on 30 years. Refi was Oct 2020, when home appraisal was 460K. They've already paid off some extra, so current balance is 306K, and if they just pay minimums, they pay it off in mid-2046 (4.5 years early).

They have access to the MHA. (I'm not looking for a discussion of this element of the tax code, of course. I'm just looking to help this family member.)

So they could write off up to about 71K/yr in housing expenses (due to the fair market value of their home rented in their market if fully furnished). So that's the 5900 for taxes and insurance and the 16800 for P&amp;I, so 22700.

And then they could write off additional principal paydown up to about 48K/yr. They are in the 22% bracket, so the additional tax savings would be about 10K. A guaranteed 22% return is attractive, but it's one time, and then those funds are sitting in their home equity, not working for them.

Paying off the house within the MHA would forego earnings if they paid the minimum and invested it for the life of the loan. Just paying the minimum and paying tax on the income would leave them with 48K - 10K = 38K to invest for the next 23.5 years. (Of course, each year passing means another 38K or so invested, but also fewer years to have it invested...)

38K invested, assuming 2.5% cost of capital (because that's what they're paying in interest annually on it), and an assumed real return of 5%, e.g., means a return of 2.5% after inflation and after factoring in the mortgage. In 23.5 years, that'd be 68K in today's dollars. Of course, there's risk to this, and only working from estimates.

I generally am in the ""don't pay off such a low rate mortgage, just invest and enjoy the liquidity and returns"" camp. But with the guaranteed tax savings, I'm wondering second-guessing that approach...

Am I thinking of this rightly? Anything I'm missing? How would you advise them? Or what questions would you ask them?

I am getting close to paying off debts and looking at next steps.  I am currently paying off a significant debt on a credit card.  Long story, but I was in a crunch last year and ran up about $10k on a credit card.  I now have it down to about $4k and expect to have it paid in full in the next three months.   


Once I have it paid off, I intend to pay off a debt of $9k.  I had a metal roof installed on my house and financed by the installer.  It was originally around $13k.  I now have it down to $9k @ 7.99% interest. The monthly payment is $130, but I'm paying for $420/month (because it amuses me to pay that amount).  My intention is that once the credit card is paid off, I'll raise the roof payment to $666 (because it will amuse me further to pay that amount.) Doing that should have that loan paid in full in about a year and a half.  So ... this is long term planning, I acknowledge.   


So come mid 2024 or 2025 I will be completely debt free, no personal loans, no credit card debt, etc.  I will only have my mortgages.   


I currently max out my personal ROTH contributions each year, invest an additional $200/month into a brokerage account, and invest 3% of my salary (with an employer match of 7%) for 10% of salary going into my 401k.  Once my debts are paid off, I will have about an additional $1k month for further debt reduction or investing.    


I am thinking of the following strategies:  


* I own two houses.  One a duplex.  I live in one side, rent the other side out.  My tenant's rent is roughly about the same as the mortgage.  Because I am making additional payments towards this mortgage, it should be paid off in 6 years.  The balance is around $50k @ 3% interest. Since I've had this loan for about 6 years, currently each month's payment has the amount going to principal at about twice the amount going to interest.  

*  The second home I own is a 3 BR, currently rented for about the same amount as the mortgage.  Currently balance on that one is $215k @ 5% interest. The mortgage is only about a year old, so currently each month's payment has the amount going to  interest is about three times the amount going to principal. 

I am over 50, so I am eligible to make ""catch up"" contributions to my employer's 401k plan.   


What strategies would you guys recommend I pursue with the additional money I will have each month?  Should I simply put it all into my employer's 401k plan as ""catch up payments""?  Look at paying off my duplex? This is my personal leaning. The idea of owning a completely paid off home is very appealing, but... the loan is only 3%.  Should I start making double or triple payments on my house since it's really early in the loan and it's a 5% rate ? And my duplex will be paid off in 5 or 6 years anyway?

83,financialindependence,"To elaborate.

After years writing stories for free, I jumped into the ""Writing stories for Kindle"" scene, failed horribly, and opted to switch to serialized approach over at RoyalRoad + a Patreon.

2 years of sweat, and I reached a point where I'm making enough to cover the bills and live off of my writing. Not enough to save or do much else though. And I'm worrying that I might need to change tracks if there's not much more growth available.

So the question I keep asking myself is... now what?

84,financialindependence,"I‚Äôm 25 y.o. and having somewhat of a crisis. I have a high paying job in finance, 150k salary (only 4 years out of school) but as a 9-5 it takes up most of my time and doesn‚Äôt give me the time I need to build my business. 

Over the past year I started buying real estate on the side and have worked my way up to 6 units which cash flow for me well- though nowhere close to the income I make in my w2. I love doing real estate. I want to build an empire of rentals for myself. But it is a lot of work and I need to spend even more time on it to grow in this field.  I wanted to quit my w2 in 2024 until I realized that not having a w2 makes you less bankable to lenders and that‚Äôs going to be a tough challenge for further RE purchases and larger transactions. 

So here‚Äôs my dilemma. I need a job that pays me well (so I can put those reserves into my biz) with less expectations. My job isn‚Äôt necessarily hard but I‚Äôve been promoted so with that comes more client facing responsibilities I‚Äôm not willing to put more time into. It also eats up most of the work week for business as well so I feel like I have a huge opportunity cost. I‚Äôm willing to change jobs but it‚Äôs hard to leave the take home pay I get right now because it gives me leverage for my side hustle. 

My question to you all is- what kind of jobs are out there that require low effort and low level of skill so that I can redirect all my energy into growing my real estate business? And maybe there isn‚Äôt such job but I‚Äôd like to hope there are alternatives to what I‚Äôm doing right now. As far as experience, I worked in the Private Bank for 2 years and now going on my second year in Asset Management as a product specialist in fixed income.","Low effort, high paying jobs in finance",1673270585

There are different paths to take when looking for employment and a new lifestyle in Malta. The Island is an attractive place to live, enhance your career and enjoy more financial benefits. If you want the best out of it, follow our tips on landing that dream job.

## Working in Malta | Guides, and Resources

Working in Malta is very different from working in most European countries. The Maltese love the sun and the sea, so they take most of their holidays during the summer months. This means more jobs are available for seasonal workers during the summer but fewer opportunities for permanent employment.

However, if you're looking for work in Malta and are prepared to relocate, you will find many opportunities. If you're an EU citizen, they must offer you any advertised job before anyone else. But if you're from outside the EU, there may be restrictions on what kind of job you can get.

Malta is a small island nation in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Italy. It's known for its beautiful beaches and warm weather, but it's also a great workplace.

Malta is a member of the European Union and uses the euro as its currency. In addition to making your own money and paying taxes in Malta, you'll also need to be aware of tax obligations in your home country (where you pay taxes on income earned abroad).

## Work Permits

EU citizens don't need a work permit to work in Malta. However, they do need to register with the government within seven days of arriving in the country. Non-EU citizens will need a work permit if they plan on working in Malta for more than three months or if they plan on staying longer than six months in total. You can apply for this online through this website or by contacting your nearest embassy or consulate.

## Things You Should Know About Living and Working in Malta

WFDM LTD is the best recruitment agency where hundreds of employees have found their dream job over the years. We have an extensive database of companies looking for new employees and are committed to helping you find a job in Malta.

Here are some things you should know about living and working on this beautiful Island:

Malta is one of the most popular destinations for ex-pats. This island nation was once a popular holiday destination, but now it has become where people want to live permanently. There are many reasons why people choose Malta as their home country, including its climate, beautiful beaches, friendly people, and low cost of living. It has also been ranked as one of the happiest countries in Europe by the UN World Happiness Report 2019 due to its high quality of life and safety levels.

If you already have a job offer in mind or if you want to work at a specific company, we can help you find jobs near your home or apartment so that you don't have any problems with transportation every day after work hours or during weekends when there are no public transport buses available.

If you wish to relocate permanently with your family and children, many schools provide international education programs for children aged 3-18.

I believe my employer has a 5% match on retirement but Im just now able to start retirement contributions (probation period) so this week‚Äôs upcoming paycheck will be the first with retirement deductions. I started with 5% 401k and 5% Roth contributions per paycheck but there was no method to that choosing and I can change it as I please. 

I live at home with my parents still so no rent, car is paid off, no car insurance or phone bill (thank you parents), and essentially no bills at this time. I live pretty frugally without an issue normally. 

I have one private loan ($7.5k) that I‚Äôm making payments on monthly ($80 per month) and approximately $80k in student loans but obviously not paying those yet because they‚Äôre paused. I‚Äôve considered just paying off the private loan in full but honestly have no idea if that‚Äôs a good idea or not. Other than loans no debt and I have a good credit score. 

Here‚Äôs where I need some help: I worked a lot during school and I have just over $50k sitting in my savings account. Essentially all of my paychecks have completely gone to savings and just sit there which seems wasteful and Id love to put it to good use in investments of some sorts or something so it doesn‚Äôt just sit there.

However, I know a Roth IRA is more flexible with less restrictions &amp; better for younger people with high income potential. 

Also worth noting, I have a Traditional 401k with my job where they match up to 6%. I meet that &amp; plus some, contributing 8%.
Figured diversifying a Traditional 401k with a Roth IRA makes sense.

So I am faced with either‚Ä¶
- converting my Acorns Traditional IRA to a Roth &amp; taking on a bigger immediate tax burden 
OR 
- just opening a new Roth IRA account with Fidelity &amp; leaving my Acorns Traditional as is going forward.

Could also potentially move my Robinhood personal portfolio to Fidelity as well.

I am curious as to:
1) Which option is easiest and/or preferred? Converting Traditional or just opening new Roth?
2) Would the tax burden for converting my Traditional even be that bothersome since I only had $1k?

**What are the benefits of investing in Crypto?**

Cryptocurrency has become increasingly popular in recent years as more people are turning to digital currencies for the potential to make big profits. Crypto investments can offer a variety of benefits, including a higher rate of return than traditional investments, greater liquidity, anonymity, and global access. 

First and foremost, investing in crypto offers a great opportunity for investors to potentially earn a high rate of return. Cryptocurrency markets are still relatively new and rapidly changing, meaning there are often major price movements and high volatility. This provides opportunities for traders to take advantage of price fluctuations and the potential for significant returns.

Another benefit of investing in crypto is the increased liquidity. Since cryptocurrencies are traded 24/7, investors can easily access their funds at any time. This makes it easier to move funds in and out of different positions with minimal effort and minimal market impact. 

Crypto also offers greater privacy and anonymity than many other investments. For those looking to protect their financial privacy, crypto can be an ideal choice since transactions are completely anonymous and no personal information is required for trading.

Finally, crypto investments provide access to a global market. Unlike traditional investments, cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold anywhere in the world without restrictions, making them accessible to virtually everyone with an internet connection. This gives investors the ability to diversify their portfolio by taking advantage of international markets and diverse investment opportunities. 

Overall, investing in cryptocurrency offers many potential benefits that could help investors increase their earnings and grow their portfolios. With its high volatility and global access, crypto presents a unique opportunity to take advantage of both short-term and long-term opportunities 

in the market.

**How do I start investing in Crypto?**

Next, you‚Äôll need to set up a wallet. Wallets are the secure online storage places for your cryptocurrency holdings. You‚Äôll need to create an account with a reliable wallet provider and choose a secure password. Once you‚Äôve done this, you can transfer funds from your bank account or credit card into your wallet.

Once your wallet is set up, you‚Äôre ready to start investing in crypto. The simplest way to get started is by trading via an exchange.

Once you‚Äôve chosen an exchange, you can deposit funds into your account and begin trading. The amount of money you‚Äôll need to get started depends on the exchange and the cryptocurrency you‚Äôre investing in. Some exchanges require minimum deposits while others do not.

Finally, it‚Äôs important to stay informed and up-to-date on news related to the cryptocurrency markets. Keeping up with current trends and market movements can help you make informed decisions about when to buy and sell your investments. It‚Äôs also important to remember that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, so be sure to always manage your risk carefully.

117,financialindependence,"Context: currently mid 20s, in California

So I've calculated my estimated FIRE number with the 4% rule, but I'm worried that it's not as accurate as it could be (currently 2.5mm, but that's relatively conservative). Obviously, I realize that the number will likely change over time, but I'd like to hedge against significant expected costs, if possible. 

For example, I'd like to have a kid sometime in the next 10 years or so, but I don't have a clue how much that would impact my journey to FIRE. 

For the parents out there, how much do you expect it to ultimately cost to raise your child from birth to 22? The annual estimates I've seen are around 20-30k/year, so I'm expecting it to cost somewhere between 200k - 300k raising your child to 18. Add in some large variability if they choose to go to college, and I'm looking at a potential max of 500k/kid, which is a bit intimidating.  I'm just worried that having even a single kid might delay my FIRE age significantly (more than 5 years or so), but maybe I'm overthinking it.

And are there other life events I should be prepared for in my FIRE estimates? Maybe marriage, first house, etc.?

The more I think about this, the more the DINK life sounds great...

I wanted to Post this outlook from Vanguard.  Basically, they're project international stocks to outperform domestic stocks by 2-3% for the next 10 years.  The mantra that has been publicized in some popular videos and such really focuses heavily on domestic markets (VTSAX and Chill), however for true indexers I'd recommend doing research on **VTWAX**.  It's Cap-weighted for the contribution of world markets at about 40%.  That said, the impulsive play may be to switch to VTIAX (Vanguard International Stock Admirals), but there's a risk of missing timing, and missing the next transformational American Bull Market.

If one were to try and attach a narrative to it, the US Stock Market is still high in P/E  (\~20) due to major QE, Unfunded Tax Cuts, and Pandemic Stimulus from every angle.  If the market were to shed another 25% the underlying P/E would be within normal historic ranges. 

That said, the Rest-of-world markets also have a larger standard of living increase to incorporate into their economies.  In the US, we're all pretty close to the top of World Standard of Living as far as things you can buy are concerned.  We have grinding issues of poverty, inequity, health care, and myriad others, but the rest of the world (on the whole minus small rich western European nations) has a larger gap.

**TL;DR: The next 10 years may see the US fall behind foreign Indices.  I'd recommend considering diversification through adding VTIAX to VTSAX, or transitioning to VTWAX.**","Heads up to the ""VTSAX and Chill"" Contingent, May want to Scope out VTWAX",1673106726

* $300 profit/month from a $200K rental property ($100K left on mortgage)

**Net Worth - \~690K** (not counting equity in rental property)

* Regular Mutual Fund + vested RSUs : $160K + $55K = $215K
* Roth IRA: $130K
* 401K: $230K
* HSA: $25K
* Regular Savings Accounts (Emergency, House Fund, Travel Fund): $90K

**Large Outflows**

* We generally try to put away $4500/month in any savings source (whether mutual fund or 401K).
* $3500 rent/month (we live in the middle of a high COL city)
* Planning for infant daycare in the next year

\-----

We will be in this high COL city for another couple years and aren't ready to move to a cheaper part of town. We are planning to have kids this year. Daycare for an infant costs $3600/month where we live; though I will also have 6 months maternity leave, so hopefully we can minimize the infant costs with daycare. Since I'm not even pregnant, we have at least another 1.5 years of savings before we'll need to pay for infant daycare. However, we are planning to ease back on our savings rate this year so that we can ""live it up"" more as a DINK.

Eventually, we hope to move to a lower COL city, but that's highly dependent on our jobs. Regardless, we won't live in the center of town for more than a few more years. When we do move in a few years, we have a vague plan to buy a house. I'm hoping that our current accessible savings (from savings account + regular mutual fund) is enough for a deposit at that time. We don't plan to be saving much while paying for daycare; possibly we'll only aim to max my 401K as I get a 50% match.

I have a few questions.

* Are we Coast FIRE? 
   * I'm confused as to what I should put in the ""Annual Spending in Retirement"" bucket, as I don't know what $30K/$50K would mean in 30 more years.
      * I also see that the median price for a nursing home is $7K. Are we supposed to plan for $14K/month in expenses by the time we retire? That seem inordinate and not what most people can do.
   * Same with current invested assets: I think we're coast fire if we take everything into account, but should we only count the retirement accounts (401K, HSA, IRA)? Considering we'll probably be taking a big chunk out of our mutual funds to buy a house in a couple years (but at the same time, we'll still have at least 2 more years of savings until then).
* Is it okay to not really plan to save while paying for infant daycare?
   * I'm hoping that our base is large enough that not saving for a couple years won't make a big dent.
* Any other feedback on our plan? Any things we should take into consideration as we continue to save for a house and plan for kids?

This 'loophole' hinges on whether a 529 to Roth IRA conversion requires the beneficiary to have *earned income* in the year they convert.  This nuance is important for the early retirement crowd, as they are likely to have no earned income when the conversion could first be initiated.

162,financialindependence,"# Are I-Bonds Worth It? ... Should You Invest in I-Bonds?

&amp;#x200B;

I-bonds are Inflation protected bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury.

I-bonds' rate of return is based on the economy's **Inflation rate**.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seriesibond.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seriesibond.asp)

&amp;#x200B;

These rates adjust semi-annually, and the payout is revised accordingly.

As of January 5, 2023 as I am writing this, the current payout is **6.89%**.

[https://treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/i-bonds/i-bonds-interest-rates/](https://treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/i-bonds/i-bonds-interest-rates/)

&amp;#x200B;

You can buy I-bonds directly from the U.S. government with an account at treasurydirect (as above).

But keep in mind that the **annual limit is $10,000**, and that these bonds cannot be re-sold to others.

&amp;#x200B;

Hence we face the **two problems** with I-bonds:

* They are not scalable with more money. Only $10,000 may be invested in annually, no more.
* Their rate of return may actually decrease - the likely outcome, as inflation subsides in 2023.

So the question is.. Are there **other ways to ""Park"" money** that gives a *higher return*, that is *scalable*?

# 

# Good alternatives exist.

You can also ""Park"" your money by writing **cash-secured puts** on equities that you don't mind buying.

Take the Tesla stock ($TSLA) for example. Everyone knows this company, it is (or) was doing quite well.

Currently, Tesla has fallen quite a bit from its former glory days at \~$380 a share to now \~$110 a share.

&amp;#x200B;

As you know, that's a long way down. The pre-covid crash levels valued the stock **around $50** or so.

So what if you had a chance to buy this stock at $50, would that be a good deal? Most *might* agree.

Parking $5000, you can write (sell) a **cash-secured put option** of that you will buy 100 shares at $50.

For date of January 19, 2024 put option for that price as an example, you can get paid \~$447 for it:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA240119P00050000?p=TSLA240119P00050000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA240119P00050000?p=TSLA240119P00050000)

&amp;#x200B;

# Putting that all together,

This means that you can generate a rate of return of about \~9% annual ***if you ""like the stock""***.

But keep in mind that writing cash-secured puts carries a risk as well. **The stock could go to zero**.

So **there is inherent risk** as opposed to **bonds, which carry no risk** and are backed by the U.S.

But then, wouldn't being able to buy $TSLA at pre-covid levels a good deal? *That's up to you to decide.*

***So keep in mind that a higher rate of return is almost always accompanied by taking greater risk.***

173,financialindependence,"I've dedicated most of my major life decisions towards maximizing my income, with the goals of freedom and security. The theme of this year: shit happens, and if money can't solve your problems you probably don't have enough money.

Now for the fun part!

**Basics:**

* Salary: 100k, minus 2 months on short term disability and plus a few side gigs
* Take Home Income: 70k, +30k YoY, 4k not from primary job
* Spending: 59.5k, +30k YoY, 20k of this was unexpected/one-off
* NW: 50k, all invested, 0 liquid. I do not count my paid off vehicle

**Spending**: These were my top 5 spending categories, from largest to smallest.

1. 36% or 25k Others- gifts and family
2. 17% or 12k Basics- rent, car insurance, cell plan, and Spotify
3. 11% or 8k Food- 5k on groceries, 3k on eating out. This and travel are my primary indulgences
4. 10% or 7k Travel5: 9% or 6k Wedding

**Reflection:**

In March of this year, my parents gave me a few days notice before effectively dropping my youngest brother on my doorstep. This required my partner and I to move to and furnish a very expensive place in San Diego, CA on less than a week of notice. The ensuing legal battle also resulted in hefty lawyer fees and we had to cancel a honeymoon trip to Dublin. Once the dust settled and I no longer had my brother, we had to move again. All in, it cost $14k not counting the hidden costs of a HCOL for those few months, a second move, etc. My partner did not contribute to related expenses, including rent for the 3 months we were were in San Diego. Any quantities my parents reimbursed were subtracted from all calculations. From a financial standpoint, I don't recommend being the eldest child in a family with shit parents.

I got married in September! The wedding was perfect for us and cost 12k. My husband and I split the total, although I've loaned him 6k which I am expecting to see next year. This is why my liquid savings are still so low; I've been covering housing. We are maintaining separate finances since we have very different financial habits and goals. My new in-laws covered our honeymoon hotel as a gift, which was awesome, and we received $600 in monetary gifts. Most of the expenses were because we paid for food, lodging, and plane tickets where applicable for all 10 of our guests.

I absolutely would not have been able to do any of that without my income, and it's a miracle I handled so much unexpected spend and still came out on top for the year. I didn't keep to my budget at all, but was in survival mode for a while and just throwing money at problems until they went away. I was working a high-stress full time consulting job, a part time restaurant job, and being a 24/7 caretaker to a very mentally ill teenager (not to mention planning a wedding.) This ultimately resulted in a minor breakdown and \~2 months on short term disability, which negatively impacted my income but  allowed me to keep my consulting job (although I did quit a side gig making ramen.)

My financial goals last year were to pursue more side gigs and contribute more to my husband's student loans. I made 1.8k in side income, and I didn't contribute to his student loans at all but did loan him a significant amount. I'd consider these both successes, especially considering the circumstances. My financial goals for next year are to grow a 15k emergency fund (currently 0), be within budget at least 8 of 12 months, and max out all retirement accounts including my HSA.","FIRE Year 2 Review: +10k NW, 20k in unexpected spend",1672952441

I don't think I've ever done a FI update post before, but pre law school I would every couple of months in the daily threads. I figured I would make my (first) post here for tracking! I don't do a super diligent job tracking my expenses so I will ballpark as much as possible. 

I'm currently a 2L in law school hoping to work in public interest after graduating (such as at a Public Defender's Office or Legal Aid, pay should be around 70K). Before law school I worked in biotech, and very fortunately, my company got acquired by a large pharmaceutical and all of my options got exercised on top of 6 months of severance (when I was quitting anyways for law school LOL, such bizarrely good luck) which netted me a total of \~150K after taxes, which is really the main reason why we have so many assets (relatively speaking) for our age. 

**Income: 134K** 

Wife: 67K in the nonprofit field that is almost entirely WFH. She actually got promoted at the beginning of last year for a couple grand raise. She likes it there a lot, but they are based in a different state, so the health insurance costs quite a bit (\~$450 per month). 

Me: Also 67K (57K from independently tutoring about 10-20hours per week, 10K school stipend for my summer internship). 

**Worth (295K) (Cash/bonds: 48K) (Stock: 247K)**

Un-allocated Cash: 10K in her checking account, 10K in mine, and then 10K in our E-fund 

Allocated Cash: 8K for a 2025 wedding (we had a legal wedding back in the day at the town hall but wanted to wait to save $$ for a real one). Aiming to save up about another 8K. 

I-Bonds: 10K 

Roth IRAs: 30K in mine, 18K in hers. 

401K: 34K in mine, 18K in hers 

Joint brokerage 147K (down a good 15K despite throwing in money at it OOF). 

\*Our stocks are almost entirely VTSAX. 

**Debt:**

100K in student loans (all me LOL) 

**Expenses: ($3,645 per mo)**

I really don't track expenses but we are relatively frugal. We tend to spend a bit more around finals as I get too busy to cook and it's not really fair on the wife to front that burden. Here is my best guestimate. We also have some random expenses, like travel for us to visit home (she's not American). We also help pay for her family's air fare to come over and such. 

Rent: $1950 per month

Health Insurance (via spouse): $450 per month 

Phone: $100 per month 

Internet: $100 per month

Food: $500 per month (groceries here are so expensive!!) 

Going out to eat: \~$350 per month

Subway: variable since I bike when it's nice, but probably $120 per month 

Dog Expenses: $75 per month 

**Thoughts**

Were definitely pretty cash heavy. Going into Law School I was a little unsure of how well I could balance working with law school but the tutoring is pretty minimal, I can set it to my schedule, and has been surprisingly consistent. I've gotten pretty decent grades so far too, so I feel like it is still sustainable. I would invest it, but I think at this point we'll likely be putting some to the side for a down payment for a house, which would ideally be in about 4-5 years depending on if my wife decides grad school. We'd likely use most of our brokerage plus another chunk of cash. 

I'm not concerned about my law school debt. The school I chose has some of the best debt forgiveness (LRAP) for lawyers, which was one of the major deciding factors, so I will be relying on that to pay most of my loans. (The way it works is they pay my entire student loan payment until I start to earn &gt;110K total, so after graduating I will supplement my attorney pay with tutoring right up until the 110 mark). 

The ""sirens call"" of corporate big law does still occasionally seem appealing (I think they start at like 210K base nowadays) but it's really not the reason I went to law school and I have no interest in that field. I'm also at the point where I've only done internships for direct-client service organizations so this would be a somewhat difficult pivot anyways - for the best. 

Moving forward we will continue to max out our Roths, and then focus on our more short term goals (wedding/down deposit). I don't regret going to law school and I have really enjoyed the (small amount) of work I've been able to do via internships/externships. My attorney salary is going to be less than what I made as an associate scientist in biotech, at least at first, but I still feel like it was the right move to make. I feel like this sub can sometimes discourage ""passion"" fields, but I suppose I shouldn't be speaking too forwardly as I have only interned.

We are also technically working as contractors for the prior company to help ease the transition (but with basically no commitment in terms of hours) which will give us some extra cash per month and health plans.

I didn't create this post to talk about how I got to this point, but rather my inner feelings. Since FIRE'ing, which still doesn't seem entirely real, I have mostly just been sitting on my phone or computer and not really doing much. Even video games don't feel satisfying. Sure I go out sometimes for coffee or errands, and see family friends a few times a week, but there is a large sense of boredom and almost emptiness. Like, is this really it? I need to find something to do now every day. Despite reading other FIRE experiences over the years, I still somewhat hoped it would be a transformational experience. But now I understand that I am still me - if I want my life to be dramatically different, I need to actively make that happen. Money just makes it easier. 

I am also somewhat limited by my wife - since she is pregnant, and generally an anxious person, she doesn't want to do anything too crazy such as spend a year traveling or moving out of state. We are going to Miami in a week to celebrate (which should be really fun and relaxing), but that's about it. Right now I am basically home most of the time, the weather is cold right now, and even at my startup I worked from home so not much changed there. 

I'm strongly considering just working more or creating a new company, but I am very hesitant to occupy all my spare time with work again. Like is there anything else that's better that can fill the gap? Or am I just mentally supposed to work all the time? Since I spent most of my life working, it's difficult for me to switch gears and live a life of leisure or non-work related adventure.

I used to in my mind classify people into two categories, financially independent and people who are stuck working all the time, but maybe that's a wrong paradigm. Now I think people are just people. Everyone in their first person perspective has the same sorts of feelings and problems. Poor people can be happier than the rich and vice versa. Money can solve external problems or free up your schedule for new experiences, but doesn't change your perception or mind.

This whole post seems a bit rambly and I don't know the exact reason I'm even writing it. Maybe it will help someone, maybe it will help me.

I think honestly 75% of the problem is that I'm just holed up in my house too much and getting a bit stir crazy especially since it's cold out. Doom-scrolling various sites isn't really helping there. I almost feel like I need to detox from my current routines but I don't know exactly how and have little motivation to do so right now.",Inner feelings and sense of emptiness after FIRE-ing a few days ago,1672884981

In the past year, I've just begin to understand how awesome compound interest is. People should learn when they're 12 or 13 on how to actually make money. 

The secret sauce is to live frugally, save as much as you can, and just invest your money in appreciating assets over time. Literally everyone can be a multi millionaire if they traditionally retire at 64 (if they really want to do it). 

They should have an investment course where students learn about stocks, a life economics course, a frugal studies course. School should teach is real life skills instead of some of the useless jargon they stuff down our throats.

I'm a senior in CS at a very good university and here's my approximate financial footing going into the internship:

* $0 credit card debt (always pay on time in full)
* $8k cash savings in 3.3% APY HYSA
* $2k crypto (Bitcoin and Ethereum)
* $13.5k Index Fund, $6k Nvidia
   * &lt;-- Both of these were gifted to me at various times. I'm extremely grateful for these and I never touch them.
* 730 credit score
* **Internship will pay all housing and moving expenses**
   * Will earn approximately **$37k pre-tax**
* On parental health insurance
* Purchased a $7k car with cash in May (family will pay the insurance while I'm in school)
* Student loans (federal unsubsidized, will not qualify for forgiveness)  

   * $5.5k @ 2.75% APY
   * $6.5k @ 3.73% APY
   * $7.5k @ 3.73% APY
   * (Future) $7.5k @ whatever the 2023-2024 rate will be

* Strike price: \~$1 per share (I joined very early!)
* Preferred price based on last Series E round: $150

Given these, can someone advise me on whether I should exercise now or later? Our company wants to IPO no later than 2025, hopefully at a price higher than our Series E round.

This is a story about following FIRE subs for 4 years and then getting ready to retire. 

I learned about FIRE and investing in 2019 after using a financial planner for ~20 years.  Spent much of the pandemic reading and learning via books and online. 

4 years later, I‚Äôm managing my own portfolio, using a lazy Boglehead allocation for simplicity, and have a plan for how to withdraw and balance.

227,financialindependence,"Hi Everyone,

First off - massive thank you for anyone who takes the time to read this.

I have been worried the last few days as I keep hearing different things from people. Therefore, I am writing to some fellow vanguard users to help clarify some things. 

Please note: I use **Vanguard Australian Personal Investor**

I currently auto-invest $576 per fortnight into VAS (45%) VGS (45%) VSO (10%).

My number one concern is brokerage fees. To MY understanding, there is $0 brokerage fees, however in one of the quarterly statements from 2022 I was charged $99 for brokerage. So I assume there used to be brokerage fees (which I was unaware of) however, since they have terminated those fees? is this correct? I have never sold any ETFs thus far.

A lot of my peers keep telling me I am investing far too frequent - which is going to results in high brokerage fees. However, I am very sure they are incorrect.

My questions:

1. Is there brokerage fees to me investing my $576 fortnightly?
2. Is the management fee the **ONLY** fee where I will lose money? (unless I sell my etfs)
3. When I log onto vanguard - press portfolio - press one of the ETFs I have invested in it says for example - 3.92%. Does this same number show for everyone? or does it just show that my investments are down that number?
4. I am doing my tax return - I have never sold any ETFs, so I have never made a profit. Do I need to report this?

It just feels like I am down quite a few thousand - at around 34k when Ive invested about 38k. So I am just trying to understand all the potential hidden fees. 

Really appreciate anyone taking the time to answer this - It would be great to have a fellow vanguard mentor I could ask some questions to. Still struggling to understand a lot of this.

It stresses me out every day. I have to go into the office every day, and all I feel is the pressure to generate new business/deals. 

I‚Äôm introverted and have always enjoyed working by myself and having lots of  autonomy. I worked in a credit/risk role before this and liked the actual day to day job more, especially when remote work started becoming more popular during COVID. I loved WFH and I hate that I can‚Äôt do it anymore, despite it becoming popular among lots of jobs. 

I took my current position because you can make more money on the sales side. I could go back to the credit/risk side and probably still make what I make now, although my long term income ceiling will be lower. I never wanted a sales job, I just thought that was the path I was supposed to take since it made more money.

Hello everyone,

My house is paid off and worth \~850 K. I feel that I'm not making use of the value of the house now that it is paid off.

I have been investing in low-cost mutual funds tracking the S&amp;P for the past 20 years, and that is the bulk of my net worth.

Would getting a loan toward the value of the home make sense? I was thinking to pull out maybe 5 to 600K and immediately invest 4 to 500K in an S&amp;P fund (or dollar cost average in over the next 6 months).

I was going to keep 1 to 200K on hand to help manage the monthly payments as I am in a ""soft"" retirement phase of my life, no active income, other than my investments.

I do have excellent credit, so was thinking the amount I borrow would be at a rate far below what my investment accounts will average over the next 10 years.

1. Do you guys think this is a good idea?
2. What are my loan options, is it just a HELOC, or is there another option? (I ran across something called a cash out refinance, which sounds great, but there's no active loan on the home now, so not really refinancing)

Thank you kind redditors for your input, and happy new year to everyone!

235,financialindependence,"Over the last few months, I have been watching social media influencers like Alex Hermozi &amp; Codi Sanchez and I have finally decided to take action on investing in Small businesses. However, after 4 months of working with the SBA advisor group (SCORE) it is clear that I am still nowhere near ready to invest in a business by myself at this point as (I feel) that I do not have the experience yet to confidently run a business. In addition, I currently have an unrelated (high-paying) job and I am not ready to make the leap into entrepreneurship until I have some experience in the spaces I'd like to invest. While the businesses are simplistic in nature (ie. Gas Stations &amp; Laundromats) I recognize that there are many complexities that I am unequipped to deal with having had zero experience in the space. Additionally, I am limited in the funding I can throw into the business god forbid something goes wrong. For this reason, I have concluded that for my first deal, I do not want to be on the hook for the full equity amount of the business until I understand more about the space

The current solution that I would like to pursue is to bring one or multiple equity partners to help me on my first deals so that I can learn the ropes. From my previous explorations in RE I understand that there are scenarios where ""wholesalers"" bring investors deals in exchange for equity in the property and the ability to see how investors underwrite and manage deals. Do these scenarios also exist in the world of small business acquisitions? If so, where do I find these individuals other than PE groups?

238,financialindependence,"\[Apologies in advance for the long post\]

\[Tried posting in the weekly FIRE thread but didn't get a whole lot of traction - trying again here :). Moderators: this is not the right locations, please feel free to delete\] 

**Introduction**

We're a dual-income, no kids married couple living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I‚Äôve been a lurker on this forum for a while and really appreciate the sense of community we have. We know that we are in a very privileged position, and we are also not perfect with our finances, so would appreciate everyone‚Äôs advice. 

**Age / Industry / Location**

I‚Äôm 33 and my partner is 37. I work in Tech and my partner works in Health Care, both focusing on Strategy and Operations. We have lived together in New England since 2018 and recently moved to the Bay Area in 2022

**Target FIRE Age / Amount / Withdrawal Rate / Location**

Our overall goal is to reach financial independence so we can work on our own terms while maintaining an upper-middle-class lifestyle.

* **Target financial independence age**: \~late 40s/early 50s. Given how driven we both are, I doubt we would retire at this point, but we may decide to scale back on work. Even after we fully retire, I think we may actually pick up some part-time jobs (e.g. I teach Zumba and Dancing, my partner does MBA and Career coaching on the side)
* **Amount**: \~$4M-$6M net worth
* **Withdrawal rate**: \~4%, but honestly this is more the rule of thumb we know about and haven‚Äôt thought much about this
* **Location**: I‚Äôm from South East Asia (my parents and entire extended family are there), while my partner is from Pennsylvania. We want to be able to split our time between South East Asia and the US (uncertain on US location at the moment, but likely CA/MA/PA)

**Educational Background &amp; Plans**

We both have MBAs, and my partner also has an MS in Information Systems. We do not plan to get more education. 

* I went to a top 3 Liberal Arts college and a top 10 US MBA school, both with full ride scholarships/financial aid (very fortunate and privileged situation I must admit). 
* My partner went to a top 30 national university and top 10 healthcare-focused US MBA school, with some outstanding student loan debt (broken out in the Debt section below).

**Career Context &amp; Plans**

We‚Äôre both mid-career professionals (\~10 years of work experience) and have been relatively successful (we think). We plan to stay in our current industry (Tech for me, Healthcare for my partner) but have NO desire to make it to c-suite level executives. 

* **My career path**: Financial Data Analyst (\~4 years), Strategy Consultant and Manager (\~3 years), Tech Strategy and Operations (\~2 years)
* **My partner‚Äôs career path**: Healthcare Provider Operations (\~4 years), Healthcare Payer Strategy &amp; Operations (\~8 years)

**Current / Future Income Breakdown**

Current total comp between the two of us is \~$420K all in, broken out as follows:

* Base salary: \~$330K
* Cash-based bonus: \~$50K. Target 15% bonus rate for both of our companies, assuming average performance)
* Equity: \~$40K. I receive RSU from my Tech company. We usually do not sell these and hold onto them as part of our our long-term retirement

I anticipate receiving **a promotion mid-2023**, in which case our **total comp** would probably **jump to \~$500K-$520K** via base salary and equity increase (full year basis, pro-rated for 2023 it‚Äôs probably a 25% bump)

In addition, we have the following retirement income matches from our company:

* **My employer**: 50% match up to maximum 401k contribution, comes out to about \~$11K since I always max out my 401k
* **My partner‚Äôs employer**: 5% match-free salary contribution starting after two years of full-time work (he joined in the past 6 mo)
* **My partner‚Äôs employer also provides a pension** that vests after 5 years of service, fully vested after 30 years. At the 30 year mark the pension is anticipated to pay out \~50% of final salary including a spousal survival benefit

**Net Worth** 

* Our current total net worth is \~$750K, with \~$1.8M in total assets (including primary residence + cars) and \~$1.05M in total liability

**Asset &amp; Debt breakdown, including home, cars, etc**: total is $1.8M including primary residence + car + emergency savings. If we exclude these, it‚Äôs about $670K in invested assets 

* **Primary residence ($1.05M)**: we recently bought a 2B2B condo in Oakland CA at $1.05M. It‚Äôs in a great building and the primary school ranking is 8/10. We plan to stay here at least for the next 5 years
* **1 Car ($31K):** we bought our plug-in hybrid car about a year ago before the earlier federal tax credit ran out and have successfully obtained California CAV decal stickers for discounted FasTrak bridge/HOV lane tolls
* **401k ($415K):** total 401k balance between us two. I would say most of these are pre-tax dollars and invested in target retirement index funds/S&amp;P 500 index funds
* **Roth IRA ($175K)**: total Roth IRA contribution between us two. Some of these are converted 401k from my prior employers, some are direct back-door and mega-backdoor Roth contributions. All invested in target retirement index funds/S&amp;P 500 index funds
* **HSA ($15K)**: we haven‚Äôt been contributing to HSA in recent years since our old companies did not offer a high deductible health plan. We plan to start contributing this year and plan to use this as a savings vehicle rather than a healthcare expense vehicle. All invested in target retirement index funds/S&amp;P 500 index funds
* **Brokerage investment ($18K)**: every month we put \~$800 into after tax brokerage accounts, but likely will have to reallocate this to our HSA and LPFSA contribution starting this year. All invested in target retirement index funds/S&amp;P 500 index funds
* **Equity ($45K):** this is my vested equity amount. Have been holding onto it for a while
* **Emergency savings ($50K):** this sits in a high yield online savings account

**Debt breakdown**

* **Primary residence ($995K)**: we recently bought our home and got a 5.75% credit union mortgage rate. Obviously hoping to refinance if mortgage rates were to come down. 
* **Car loan ($33K)**: We got our car loan at an extremely cheap credit union rate (&lt;2%). 
* **Student loan ($27K)**: my partner has a minimal outstanding federal student loan balance, combined interest rate is 5.5%

**Budget breakdown** \- note that we recently purchased a home + switched health plans, so those items are definitely just an estimate. If you all notice anything strange with this budget, would appreciate your feedback.

* **Monthly income (all-in, pre-tax)**: \~$35K
* **Monthly pre-tax salary**: \~$27.5K
* **Automated monthly investment:** \~$11K
   * **GSU vesting**: \~$3K pre-tax
   * **401k pre-tax savings**: \~$3.75K (=$22.5K\*2/12) - we maxed out our pre-tax 401k savings between the two of us 
   * **Roth IRA savings**: \~$1.1K (=$6.5K\*2/12) - we both contribute to our Roth IRA using our back-door Roth contribution
   * **401k after-tax savings**: \~$2.7K - my employer‚Äôs 401k plan offers after-tax contribution and in-plan conversion, so I also contribute this to the max
   * **HSA and Limited Purpose FSA contribution**: \~$730
* **Housing expenses**: \~$8K
   * **Mortgage P&amp;I**: $5.8K. Definitely want to refinance to reduce this amount
   * **PMI**: $233. Definitely want to pay down our mortgage so we can get rid of this PMI
   * **HOA**: $750. Yes this is quite a bit, but our building has a lot of amenities which I enjoy, and this is still about ‚Öì lower than equivalent buildings in our neighborhood
   * **Property taxes**: $1.1K
   * **Home Insurance &amp; warranty**: $100 
* **Other debt payment**: \~$1.3K
   * **Car**: $625
   * **Student loan**: $650
* **Other Expense**: \~$5K
   * Grocery + eating out: $3K (yes we know this is a lot and are hoping to reduce this in the near future)
   * Car insurance + Gas/EV: $200
   * Out of pocket medical expense: $800
   * Subscription: $400 (yes, we know we have a lot here - Spotify, Hulu, Netflix, HBO, Disney+, YouTube, Economist, WSJ, NYTimes, Google Drive)
   * Everything else would be a miscellaneous expense (e.g. entertainment, dancing classes, shopping, gifts, travel, etc.)

**Health concerns**

We‚Äôre both relatively healthy and active, though we could 100% benefit from losing weight and eating healthier, which is one of our 2023 goals. We do utilize a lot of therapy / mental health services to deal with our stress. We are trying out a high-deductible health plan in 2023 which will either be a longer-term good idea or a one-time effort soon to be abandoned. 

**Family: current situation / future plans / special needs / elderly parents**

We want to have kids, but not 100% sure on timing, likely not in the next 5 years. We both value education quite a bit and so would want to save for their education.

My parents fortunately have saved enough for their comfortable retirement, though we want to be able to help them with international trips etc. 

My partner is a bit estranged from his family, though when push comes to shove we would likely end up supporting part of his parents‚Äô retirement.

**Questions?**

* Are we on track for our financial independence goals (\~$4M-$6M net worth by late 40s/early 50s)? If not, what are some things we could tweak to reach this goal?
* What are some considerations we should have given that we just closed on our first home?

I am a recent college graduate with a BS in chemical engineering. I'm currently working for a large pharmaceutical company earning $76000 + bonuses. I want to achieve FI/RE at some point before 50. Not many specifics since life changes so much, but I know I want to own a house, have kids, move around and travel. 

Currently, my NW is around $35.5k. The breakdown:

- $14k in a Roth IRA invested fully in FZROX and FZILX (70:30)

- $6k in a 401k invested in a 2060 target retirement fund, I contribute 25% of my income pre-tax bi-weekly (max contribution limit through my workplace)

- $0.5k in a taxable account invested in various stock (no strategy here yet)

- $10k in HYSA (what I consider to be my emergency fund)

- $5k in a checking account

My expenses average around $2k a month, with $1.6k going to rent and the rest going to food, utilities, wifi, etc.  With a take-home of around $3.2k, I am saving 38.5% of my take-home on top of the 25% going to my 401k.

Do you guys have any tips/tricks/advice? Anything I should do differently or focus on? I would love to hear anything, but in particular: 

- Is my IRA strategy ok for now? looking to follow a boglehead-type, passive investment strategy that minimizes risk 

- At 25% of 76k, I will be contributing under the 401k limit this year. Should I invest more into a taxable account then? If so, should I follow a low risk-boglehead strategy here too with VTI/VXUS?

TLDR: Marry well, do good work for smart people, don't beat yourself up.

I discovered FI/RE as a college senior in 2016, but didn't have the means to do much about it until 2017-2018. My journey isn't as extreme as some others, but I figure more data points are never a bad thing. My biggest jumps have come in the last two years due to a few things:

	1. Bonkers Real Estate Market
	2. Vesting Company Equity
	3. (Most Important) Getting Married to a driven, finance-minded woman.

$500k is our collective number. I will break everything down to the extent that I can. I only have my wife's info for the years we have been together, but I have tracked mine to the penny since Jan-2018. Some numbers may be rounded, so don't crucify me if summaries don't add up.

If all goes according to plan, we'll be at ~$1.25mm by 2025, &amp; ~$2mm by 2028.

**Debts**
	‚Ä¢ Mortgage is ~$440k, weighed against a home value of ~$640k. 
	‚Ä¢ No other long-term debt. My parents busted their asses on teacher's salaries to pay for my school. I plan to do the same for my children. Bought car with cash. 
	‚Ä¢ Wife had an athletic scholarship in undergrad and got tuition waived for grad school. Her car is also paid off. 


**Background / Job 1**
Middle Class upbringing in a flyover state. Degree in Finance from a state school. Average student (3.1gpa) - cared more about having fun and making connections than studying. Had a few internships that led me to believe my starting salary would be $60k-$80k (2016). Struggled to find ""the right"" job due to my own expectations &amp; ego. Ended up taking an entry-level job at a regional bank‚Ä¶talk about high finance! Starting salary: $44k.

**Job 2**
A college buddy recommended me for an analyst job at his firm. I didn't know much about the job or the company, but I interviewed because I hated my job. It turns out the interview was for a position as the COO's personal analyst. The company was doing ~$1.3B in revenue at the time. The COO liked me, so I got the job and a slight pay bump - $53k. Formed a great relationship with the COO and he gave me a few promotions while I got to learn everything about the business directly from him. 
Tenure &amp; Final Comp: 3 years, $86k

**Job 3**
Our company was recapitalized and the COO was forced out. I put some feelers out and wound up with a bigger role at a similar, but smaller, company (~$100mm revenue). Had some big professional wins, but also had to dodge some major internal political conflict and handle covid concerns. Not ideal long-term. I was brought on at $105k with a 20% bonus. I made it 13 months before my old boss called‚Ä¶""Hey man, I'm the new CEO at *Generic Company Name*, I want you to come work for me."" Which led to‚Ä¶

**Job 4 (Current)**
Growing company ($300mm rev) in a related industry. After some negotiating, he brought me on in a junior leadership role at $140k + 20% bonus, a $10k signing bonus, and a piece of equity. Not banking on the equity materializing, but if we hit our share price targets, it could be worth ~$500k-$700k for me in 18-24 months. 



**Disclaimers/Relevant Detail**
	‚Ä¢ Parents were uber-frugal and saved for 4 sons to go to college on middle class wages. My parents got me a car for my 16th birthday, I sold it after college to fund a portion of my next car which helped me avoid a car payment.
	‚Ä¢ Our wedding and honeymoon limited our savings potential the past 12 months, but we enjoyed the heck out of both.
	‚Ä¢ Definitely victims of lifestyle creep. We are fairly social and have been to 15-20 weddings the past 2 years all over the country. We spent 2 weeks in Europe for our honeymoon.
	‚Ä¢ These income levels are still new for us, but we're shooting to save/invest 30-40% every year. As of this week we're planning on spending my salary and banking hers...TBD on how well that works.

If anyone has any tips for this, feel free to share! Also if it matters, I‚Äôm 25F working in healthcare/research.


I only became financially literate in April 2022 after I decided I was no longer happy at my (then) job. Some rough personal things also happened and I realized that financial independence would offer me safety and help me have more control over my own life. Because of this, I set out to grow my net worth to $50k by 2023, which seemed impossible because my monthly savings were about $1000 on average after my personal expenses and necessities. I started in Apr with ~$25k (amount left over after years of careful budgeting, working part time through school, and paying off my hefty student loans). 


30Apr ‚Äò22: NW $25242. Deeply educated myself about finances, investing, and good financial habits. Found a new job much closer to home with a $6 hourly bump from my last one with a better health benefits package. Put my first $100 in WealthSimple Invest TFSA (now at $25k in Jan 2023).

30Sep ‚Äò22: NW $36524. Got my first longer contract.

31Oct ‚Äò22: NW $43264. Took 10 days off for family vacation. Fully booked with clients. Learning how to freelance on top of a FT job and make good use of my time.

30Nov ‚Äò22: NW $50466. Got into car accident and struggled with mental health difficulties. Distracted from work and freelancing. *met my goal days before the accident :/

255,financialindependence,"### Background

Hello all, this year in review is something we've been contributing for a few years now. Numbers are for 2 adults. If anybody would like a copy of the sheet I use you can click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11_8-x72AhngLG2sN2L9fRTPdqUOkkxDXH3MsJv8k3Gk/copy). As usual, let me know if anything doesn't jive!

Here is a link to last year's submission: [2021](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/rtltdg/2021_year_in_review_my_4th_annual_submission/)

For the last 7 years, at the end of the year I always crunch some numbers to see how our finances look in order to get a complete picture of our path towards financial independence. I add up all of our major assets, subtract all of our debts and come up with our net worth and find the year over year changes.

I then separately add up our retirement assets (essentially net worth subtracting home equity), figure out what our average monthly expenses were and perform some rudimentary calculations to project how many years from being Financially Independent we are. Essentially, I follow [MMM's Shockingly Simple Math](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/)

Note: I actually began tracking all of this in the middle of 2015. So there is a bonus 6 months at the start that can be more or less disregarded for purposes of looking at annual variations.

### Numbers

* Net Worth Change: +7% 
* Debt Change: -25%
* Retirement Change: +2.7%
* Monthly FI Expenses Change: +1%
* Savings Rate Change: +4%

Final Savings Rate: 75%

Years until FI (change from last year): 5 (0)

### Reflection &amp; Goals

All in all we had a fantastic year as far as the financial picture is concerned, even if it didn't move the needle much as far as possible FI goes. Any increase, no matter how small, in net worth and our accounts after a year where the markets were down so much I'm going to consider a huge win.. even if it's all from contributions and increased property valuation. 

It's humorous to me that as I wrote last years update I realized my allocations were out of whack and far too bond heavy. I ended up moving around $150k from bonds to international stock in Q1 last year, unfortunately half of that total came on the first of the year. Ahh well, live and learn. At least I got our asset allocation corrected and we didn't have to touch anything the rest of the year. As of today it's looking pretty good, still about 5% more cash heavy than I would like but will be buying more VTSAX in the brokerage (Finally opened one a couple of months back) with it over the next couple of months and possibly purchasing a new vehicle. Current allocations are:

* Domestic Stock: 40%
* International Stock: 37%
* Bonds: 10%
* Cash: 13%

Now that I've got the Asset Allocation figured out and our brokerage has been opened, our goals for finances are largely to just ignore things this year and continue to throw excess funds in the brokerage. We've already made our yearly i-bond purchase and due to our IRA balances and employer 401k plans M/BDR is a no-go. I suppose I should learn what the heck ""Tax Loss Harvesting"" is at some point, but don't think it's urgent. Mostly just on auto-pilot mode. 

On the life side of things, last year continued to be stressful as ever and we need to continue to focus on personal health and long-term sustainability career and lifestyle wise. My wife and I are both burnt out and seeking change. Personally I loathe the idea of retiring early about as much as the idea of needing a job until old age, so would very much like to find some sort of gig that better aligns with my needs. Applied for a few jobs last year but no luck so far.

We solidified a lot of things that were up in the air last year or things we knew we should do but just never got around to chiefly planning end of life things with an estate attorney and making decision not to have children permanent. It's nice to not have to worry about the what-ifs there, both financially and as far as life goes. I find that those types of things always add a constant level of background noise and stress to us, so it's best when we talk them out, make a decision and then take action.

I wish I had more concrete goals honestly.. but other than ""don't fuck it up"" and ""be healthy and happy"" I find it difficult to form them when I am mostly-content. Getting comfortable with being secure and content has been difficult enough the last couple of years, but here we are. I guess next up I need to get comfortable with the idea of being old and death.. but I'm not ready for that just yet LOL.

Lastly, I want to say that I appreciate all of the information and banter from all of you in the daily, especially over the last couple of years, as I think that we really are helping people reach some of their financial goals, as well as providing a ""community"" feel to this sub that a lot of folks appreciate. I've been absorbing information posted here for a decade now and it has been a great help on my journey.

257,financialindependence,"Hello r/FI community and Happy New Years! 

A recurrent topic in the subreddit is the degree of moderation - whether it is over-moderated, under-moderated, or just right. This discussion has come up to a greater extent over the last few months with [the recent addition of our newest batch of moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/xxy87e/welcoming_our_new_additions_to_the_moderation_team/). We‚Äôve been working to try and let more discussion topics through and give the home page more activity - but many in the community still feel it isn‚Äôt enough, still acting as gatekeepers to people looking for a new view on their finances and life.

This is a great corner of the internet where discussion can take place without being sidelined by politics or incivility - and that will never change as long as we are moderators - but much of the rest is potentially open for debate. Some of the criticisms we have received have been regarding the fact the subreddit isn‚Äôt as newbie friendly as it could be, that we require too much effort to start a top level post, and that this harms engagement. 

Honestly - we see some of the points, and have decided to run a bit of an experiment to start off the new year. For the next four weeks, we are proud to announce: 

# Low-Mod January Community Enhancement Event!!!! 
*^fireworks, ^cheers ^and ^applause*

For the entire month of January, the mod team will only enforce [Rules 2, 3 and 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/wiki/rules). For those who (for some reason) haven't memorized them (or clicked the link) - 2 is no spam, advertising or promotion, 3 is be civil, and 7 is no gender, politics or circle-jerks.

Why only those - these are the hallmark of the mature and respectful community we have here, and something that no one on the mod team wanted to subject our community to a removal of. Additionally, they are more behavioral rules rather than 'topic' or 'idea' type rules. We still want - and expect - mature discussion here, and these are not things we will bend on.

**So what does this mean, really?** 

The mod team will not be removing stuff that breaks the other rules of our community. Additionally, we won't be pushing or directing people to use the daily or weekly threads.

This means that basic questions, surveys, feedback requests, and just general finance topics will be temporarily allowed. Additionally, we have increased the number of reports needed for an auto-remove (so spam can still be hit, but normal posts are unlikely to reach the new threshold before a mod sees it), and have greatly lowed the karma threshold to allow more new/throwaway type accounts to post. 

Basically, treat this community as you do the rest of the reddit. Post where and what you think best fits the theme and feel of the community.

**What does this not mean?**

The mod team is not disappearing. We are still going to be around. We are still going to be removing stuff that doesn't follow rules 2, 3 or 7. We will still be banning people for breaking those rules, this isn't a free pass to act like a child. Bad actors will still be dealt with appropriately.

**So no more daily thread?**

Actually, the daily and weekly threads are going to stay as well. A good amount of the community likes the discussion and sense of community of these threads, so we are leaving them. Maybe discussion will continue, maybe not. We honestly have no idea. We want to give everyone as many ways to enjoy this sub as you want.

**And at the end???**

Honestly - we don't know yet. **We will go back to the normal rules on Feb 1**. The mod team has committed to having on going discussion between now and the end of the month about how stuff is going. Depending on those discussions, and how the community reacts to the month in general, we will determine the path forward. 

It's likely that we'll do some sort of survey/feedback gathering in early Feb as well, to ensure that everyone has a say. Additionally, we will likely pin this thread a couple of times throughout the month as a way to centralize feedback on how stuff is going. 


And that's the plan. Let us know thoughts below, both now and during the 'community enhancement event'.

258,financialindependence,"My wife and I are freshly 40 years old with a little one on the way.

We currently have $1.5 million saved in retirement accounts (a lower number than last year due to the abysmal performance of the markets). We have about two years of living expenses on hand; house paid off. 

My wife‚Äôs salary is around $20,000 per year and mine is around $280k. Mine is from running a service oriented business. 

Building my business to that point has broken me; mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I can‚Äôt sleep at night; cortisol pumps through my veins and stress dominates every aspect of my life. I can‚Äôt even enjoy my wife‚Äôs pregnancy. In my wife‚Äôs words, I have become a shell of a person. 

Ideally, we‚Äôve discussed coast-firing, starting today and until age 49, at which point, full fire with 90-100k per year. 

I appreciate all suggestions but I must share:

I‚Äôm not able to sell my business; it relies on me and me alone. When I‚Äôm done, it‚Äôs done. This is because of relationships with my clients. Imagine a barber with clients and those clients only want to be cut by that specific barber. Trying to sell my business would be like a barber trying to sell his customer list. 

I‚Äôm not going to start exercising and eating better to manage stress; I‚Äôm a former athlete and former model. My fitness and nutrition leave nothing to be desired with the exception of the damage from constant stress. 

I‚Äôve already tried therapy at least 15 times. Honestly, I find Reddit forums more helpful. Real people sharing real solutions and experiences. 

Work and maintaining clients is so stressful and is the reason I‚Äôve gotten to this point. That‚Äôs the catch 22: I have a nice amount of money saved because of the grind but I don‚Äôt even feel like a man or a quality husband anymore because of the grind. What kind of father am I going to be?

My wife and I have discussed my closing the business and getting a lower stress job to coast. The downside of this is that I would feel like I‚Äôm leaving too much money on the table by walking away from my current business. 

The only true answer that I see is to continue with my current job but let clients go, work less, and just capitalize on the time that I do spend at work. This is the challenge; just thinking about making less gives me anxiety. I want to throw up. I tried so hard to build my business and the thought of moving in reverse physically ills me. 

I spent virtually the last 15 years building my business. Years of 7 day work weeks, years of little to no sleep, years of stress GRIND STRESS SAVE MONEY STRESS GRIND STRESS SAVE MONEY. I‚Äôve had to sleep on the floors of my business before, give up time with my family, ruin relationships with exes, etc. 

I feel like a zombie who has been walking through a nightmare for a decade. I just don‚Äôt know how to let go, cut down, and be ok working a much shorter work week at a much lower salary. If I did so, I feel like I would have the same problems as now but I would just be making less. For example, if I‚Äôm making $280k and living with the constant stress and anxiety of trying to maintain that salary or make more money next year, if I cut down to $150k, won‚Äôt I be living with the same stress and anxiety of trying to maintain $150k?

I come from a poor family and a scarcity mindset; I never thought I would be able to make money doing anything. For over a decade, I‚Äôve been afraid my business is going to implode and I‚Äôm going to lose everything. Now, I just want to hit fire and never go back to it; I want to be a viable husband to my wife and an involved father to my son. I want to live life. 

Has anyone had a similar experience or can offer a shift in perspective? I posted this in fire because it‚Äôs all involving fire. I need a plan to coast fire or fire or something to get out. I‚Äôm so convinced that if I drop in salary that I‚Äôm going to lose the whole business. I‚Äôm at the lowest point I‚Äôve ever been; can‚Äôt eat, sleep, or even feign a smile. 

Thanks in advance. 

Some things I‚Äôve realized after reading through many responses in fire abs coast fire subreddits. 

I haven‚Äôt built a business; I‚Äôm simply self employed. 

I value my worth based on the amount of money I make. Saving large amounts of money makes me feel secure.

Hello,

So I found out about the Backdoor Roth IRA late and just made an account with fidelity.

I contributed $6000 (post tax) to traditional IRA with plan to convert to Roth IRA before 12/31/22 ended but it seems like the $6000 hasn't settled and I'm unable to convert it yet. I'll be converting it as soon as I can in 2022. I have no other IRAs or anything. Just have 403b that I started earlier this year (2022).

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm posting here because I need advice on how to become financially independent. I am hoping to get some suggestions based on my current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm a single mother. My son is only 3 y.o. So, I have a full-time job and a part-time freelance job. I‚Äôm working really hard so we can have a decent life. I‚Äôm also trying to be a good mother, but I guess I've failed at this job. The father of my child left us when my baby was born. Maybe it happened after 2-3 months of happy parenthood.

&amp;#x200B;

You can‚Äôt even imagine how tired I am. I don‚Äôt even remember when I had a proper day off from all my duties and dedicated some time to myself. That‚Äôs why my biggest dream is to reach financial independence, retire a bit earlier, and have some time for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

But with all my taxes, it seems impossible to put something in the savings account. Well, I try to put 10% of my paycheque in savings. But I can barely make the ends meet. I can‚Äôt afford so many things. If this is adult life, I don‚Äôt wanna it at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, now the tax office takes most of my income. It‚Äôs unfair. Aren‚Äôt there any benefits for single mothers like me?

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, things seem to be a bit better. I‚Äôve recently run into my friend who works as an accountant. I shared my story with her, and she said I shouldn‚Äôt pay so much in taxes. She said it seemed like my employer didn‚Äôt specify some of my working shifts. He didn‚Äôt put that I sometimes work hours to make some extra cash. Well, she was in a rush and couldn‚Äôt explain it in more detail. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve decided to post here.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I‚Äôve tried surfing the web and finding something useful. So, I found an online paystubs generator. But it seems a bit complicated to fill in all the info there. Besides, if I put the money I make as a freelancer, does it affect my taxes in a positive for my way?

263,financialindependence,"I have the finances to be able to max my 401k every year. 

I make $56,000 annually but have no expenses except $50 a month due to living with family. 

If I were to max my 401k, I would have to up my contributions to 32% to achieve $20,500 at the end after their 5% match. 

Aside from my 5% 401k contribution, I currently invest $600/year to crypto, $1,200/year to growth stocks, $8400 to dividend investing, and $6500 to Roth IRA. All in all, I invest $19,500 and save around $36,500. 

I plan to start business‚Äôs soon and also invest in a endeavor that will hopefully yield me 50%+ returns annually. I have so many ideas to put money towards but I am not sure if I should contribute 32% of my income to maxing my 401k? Is it worth it? 

I could lower my $8400 in dividend investing but as I have seen, investing in it now and watching it compound year after year is far more beneficial than 401k‚Äôs possible growth. (Having more years for it to snowball)

I've been working in tech for about 6 years. In 2022, I quit my job in late September after finding another job (unrelated to the tech layoffs this year). I thought it would be nice to take an extended vacation and set my start date for 2023.

My cash-flow and investment strategy is entirely hands-off. My checking account is configured to invest any amount above $4000 into my brokerage account, and refill up to $3750 via a margin loan when it goes beneath that amount. I don't have an emergency fund ‚Äî¬†I subscribe to [ERN's thoughts on keeping everything invested](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/05/05/emergency-fund/). So that means I was going to have to live off of $4k + margin for three months. It's interesting to consider because I would have had the same financial scenario had I been laid off.

In 2021, I spent $47k (comparable to previous years, trending slightly upwards), but in 2022, I spent a staggering $95k. This was due to a lot of larger purchases: $20k car (bought in cash); $8k medical bill; $7k on vacation; $6k on wedding deposits (expecting to run up to $30k total over this year).

For discretionary expenses from 2021 to 2022:

* Eating out: $4.3k ‚Üí $5.1k
* Leisure: $3.7k ‚Üí $2.9k
* Vacation: $3.2k ‚Üí $7.7k
* Gifts: $3.1k ‚Üí $3.6k
* Dates: $2.3k ‚Üí $3.5k
* Productivity: $0.5k ‚Üí $1.8k

I don't feel bad about spending more on dates, gifts, or productivity. Eating out and leisure together total around the same amount. I incurred &gt;2x more vacation costs in 2022; probably a combination of relaxed COVID restrictions and attributing one 2023 vacation to 2022 costs.

I incurred \~$20k of margin debt in Q4 2022... and I feel fine! The margin is drawn against a \~$600k account. Recent interest rate increases mean that I'm paying more in interest for that margin, but it's a small enough amount (in relative terms) that I don't feel the need to sell stock to pay it down. To be honest, if I were laid off, I would be comfortable spending several more months without income in order to find a good job, rather than just the first one available. What a luxury!

I think the lesson here is that I need to adjust my expected spending rate in retirement higher to accommodate for larger expenses which I historically haven't had a lot of. Living off of margin, without an emergency fund, hasn't presented a problem so far.

# Sabbatical

So I get to take a sabbatical and go on test-FIRE for three months! My top goal was to reestablish to a routine gym schedule and go 100% of days when not traveling. I used a habit tracker and I've gone 80% of days in total, which I consider a success overall. I've built a significant amount of strength since reestablishing a schedule.

My secondary goals were:

* Play my favorite video game competitively. I went to in-person tournaments and improved my skill level in some areas, but honestly, I'm performing about as well in Jan 2023 as in Jan 2022. I think I need to get a coach, analyze my games more, and establish a better technical practice routine.
* Arrange music. I did very little of this, to be honest. I still feel very much limited by my instrumental performance ability, not my arrangement ability. However, my performance ability has significantly increased over 2022, and I think especially during my sabbatical period, so I don't think I need a change of strategy yet.
* Learn a new language. Given that I wasn't really immersing myself, I didn't expect to have a lot of success, but I fun doing vocabulary practice and puzzling out the translations of memes.
* Do more open-source software development. I was productive and even accumulated my first GitHub sponsors.
* Write more blog posts. I wrote 5 total in 2022, of which 4 were during the sabbatical period. I got 2.7k views on my most popular post among those.
* Spend more time with friends and family. Well, I certainly wanted to spend more time with them, but they were still all working their jobs, so they couldn't just skive off whenever they wanted. So I planned a few events ahead of time for us (and was able to drive us all there, thanks to the purchase of a car), and visited some of them for lunch/dinner during/after their workdays.

It's clear that I have plenty to do to occupy myself without a job. I haven't really felt the need to quantify or assess my goals formally, as long as I'm doing something from the above in a given day.

Setting a routine for the day is really important to avoid wasting time and regretting it afterwards (wasted time which was enjoyed is not wasted!). I started going to cafes in the mornings with my laptop, just to get out of the house and have a change in scenery. In retirement, I think I'll have to plan to have a space outside the house, whether it's some assortment of cafes, parks, or even a coworking space to hang out in. That will be an important consideration when deciding what neighborhood to live in in retirement.

# Takeaways

* Margin isn't that scary; consider it.
* Plan for more big one-off expenses.
* I don't feel bad spending more on loved ones; and that's an easy type of spending to cut back on, if necessary.
* Sabbaticals are good. Plan things for your friends.
* Prioritize one habit or behavior to establish at a time, and measure that. The rest can be just for fun.","Living on margin in 2022 [HCOL, tech]",1672724297

Well, fear not! I've detonated my budget enough times to know what it's like when nothing seems to work.

* I've somehow managed to live month-to-month while making six figures at a w2.
* I've filled emergency funds only to drain them **DAYS** later for fix-and-flip rehab costs.
* I've told my wife that we should go **FULL** Dave Ramsey, only to justify our loans because, ""We pay 4%, but I can make 15% on this investment.""
* I've argued with my wife about whether we should fund a vacation or buy an equally expensive online course.

I could go on...

My problem has always been that there is just too much contrasting advice when it comes to personal finance, and every time I learned something new, my shiny object syndrome would kick in, and send me off in a new direction.

Being the engineer that I am, I decided it was time to create **MY OWN** framework. One that would combine Dave Ramsey's ""Baby Steps"" with Robert Kiyosaki's ""Cashflow"" board game.

This framework has gone through several iterations to satisfy:

* The **entrepreneur** in me, who understands that the further you live below your means, the faster you can expand your income.
* The **husband** in me, who knows that quality of life is sometimes more important than the cost of living.
* The **investor** in me, who knows that for every dollar sitting in our bank account, we are losing not only to inflation but also to the opportunity cost of not putting our money to work.
* The **father** in me, who knows that having little to no cash in our bank account puts my family at unnecessary risk and adds stress where it otherwise is not needed.

I've created The Bombproof Budget framework over several years to address the multiple contradictions I've experienced when managing my family's finances.

Here are some benefits that I believe my framework provides:

* Following action steps forces us to take consistent action without deviating from the original goal.
* Automatic investment in personal development stimulates income growth.
* How money flows for discretionary spending puts a rev limiter on my family's lifestyle creep.
* Zero-Based budgeting forces us to visualize our sacrifices when discussing with my wife what to spend our money on next.
* Focusing on cash flow allows us to visualize how close we are to achieving financial freedom.

An Overview

Before you get to the action steps, you first need to understand the components that make up The Bombproof Budget. It will consist of the zero-based budgeting method, ten category groups, runway, overage funds, and action steps that guide decision-making.

The Zero-Based Budgeting Method

The Zero-Based budgeting method means that I give every dollar a job. Any good entrepreneur knows that we need to make money work for us, instead of allowing ourselves to work for money.

This method is a habit that requires repetition. We still don't always get it right, but we certainly get better with the more reps we put in. My wife and I sit down for 15 minutes daily to process new transactions and see what's left in each spending category.

Category Groups

These are the category groups that house the sub-categories which we use to track both income and spending:

üõê **GIVING** (Builds Character)  
üßæ **TAXES** (Income Withholdings)  
üè† **NECESSITY** (Cost of Living)  
üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY** (Safety of Mind)  
üòÖ **UNPLANNED** (Shit I Didn't Think About)  
üí∏ **CONSUMER** **DEBT** (Ouch, My Cashflow)  
üå± **DEVELOPMENT** (Grow Our Income)  
üéâ **LIFESTYLE** (Fun &amp; Adventure)  
‚öîÔ∏è **WAR** **CHEST** (Business &amp; Investments) ¬† &lt; ‚Äì ‚Äì OOOOooooo what's this???  
‚öñÔ∏è **LOANS** (Bridge Loans &amp; Notes)

üõê **GIVING** (Builds Character)It accounts for the 10% of my income I set aside for giving. Giving has developed into a habit that I believe has shaped how I conduct my business into leading with service and integrity.

üßæ **TAXES** (Income Withholdings)Accounts for the 30% of my income that I deduct for Uncle Sam, but once I've already set it aside, I do everything within my power to reduce the amount I spend.

**üè† NECESSITY** (Cost of Living)Accounts for the expenses that make up my family's monthly cost of living. This category puts food on the table, keeps us warm, provides modern necessities, and gets us to where we need to go. Nothing more.

**üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY** (Safety of Mind)Accounts for everything that protects my family when shit goes wrong. This covers everything from insurance payments to deductibles, advisory fees, healthcare, and our emergency fund.

**üòÖ UNPLANNED** (Shit I Didn't Think About)Accounts for the 5% of my spending added to the budget for all less frequent expenses - the ones we either forgot about or never planned for in the first place.

**üí∏ CONSUMER** **DEBT** (Ouch, My Cashflow)Accounts for every liability that's not tied to an income-producing asset (except for our home). I'm a cash flow investor, and the lower I can make my monthly expenses, the higher my monthly cash flow becomes. This means getting aggressive with consumer debt.

üå± **DEVELOPMENT** (Grow Our Income)Accounts for 10% of my monthly income that I spend on personal development, which leads directly to income growth. Because the ¬†10% allows this category to grow as my budget increases, it allows my spending to scale as my income scales. Early on, I would buy $20 books, then $500 certifications, pretty soon I'm joining $5,000 mastermind groups, and setting my sights on hiring a $25k performance coach! (all of which provide WAY more value than a $100k college degree btw...)

üéâ **LIFESTYLE** (Fun &amp; Adventure)It accounts for 10% of my monthly income that I set aside for lifestyle. This is where we fund **ALL** of our discretionary spending. From date nights to vacations, new laptops, and that pet chameleon my wife's been eyeballing for a while now üôÑ. As with the development category above, our lifestyle scales with our income. Vacations might be road trips for now, but in a few years, we'll be flying 1st class and staying at the Four Seasons.

‚öîÔ∏è **WAR** **CHEST** (Business &amp; Investments)This is where **ALL** of our cash flow ends up. The war chest then becomes a resource for my deal-making strategies. When I look to buy an asset, I only underwrite deals that I could buy with the funds that are in my war chest. This prevents me from becoming the buyer that backs out of a deal because I couldn't secure funding. **LET ME BE CLEAR**. If I find a deal that I like, I do everything within my power **NOT** to touch my war chest. (This category deserves a deep dive all on its own.)

‚öñÔ∏è **LOANS** (Bridge Loans &amp; Notes)Accounts for all money I loan to any of my ventures which I plan on eventually getting back. The money used is borrowed from the war chest fund and tracked here.

Runway

Our runway is comprised of these four categories:üè† **NECESSITY** (Cost of Living)üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY** (Safety of Mind)üòÖ **UNPLANNED** (Shit I Didn't Think About)üí∏ **CONSUMER** **DEBT** (Ouch, My Cashflow)

We determine first our üè† **NECESSITY**, üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY**, and üí∏ **CONSUMERDEBT**. Once we have that number, we multiply it by 5%, which becomes our monthly üòÖ **UNPLANNED** contribution.

Then we add all 4 of these categories up, which equals one month of runway.

Overage Funds

Overage funds are an excellent way to simplify our numbers while adding just a little padding for the variable expenses. I like to round up to the nearest hundred in each category group.

For example, on average, my üè† **NECESSITY** category adds up to $2,940.19/mo. ¬†I want to add an overage fund of $59.81 so that my category reflects a nice round of $3,000/mo.

Action Steps

**STEP ONE: Deduct Withholdings**  
As my money flows in, it doesn't matter if it's daily, monthly, or quarterly; I take 10% off the top before doing anything else. Next, I set 30% aside for my tax withholdings. If I successfully reduce my taxable income for the year, all excess money is moved into my war chest.

**STEP TWO: Fund the Next 3 Months of Runway**  
Since I don't receive w2 income, I like to keep at least three months of runway funded for the months ahead. In this way, I am reassured that I have time between capital events before worrying about picking up some part-time income to fill in the gaps. If it is January, and I have February through March funded, then I will send any new income to STEP THREE, but the moment February 1st rolls around, all new income needs to be redirected to funding April's runway before allowing the transition to STEP THREE once more.

**STEP THREE: Pay Off ALL Consumer Debt**  
I like to get LEAN on my expenses. My goal is to become financially independent, not to drive a nicer car or live in a bigger house (those will come later). It's much easier to quit your job if you only need $4k of passive income instead of $10k. Not to mention how fast that additional cash flow accelerates wealth building.

**STEP FOUR: Invest 20% into Development (10%) &amp; Lifestyle (10%)**  
Now that I've cut the fat and my expenses are as low as I can make them, I begin to fund our personal development. We take 10% of our income, which is 5% for me and 5% for my wife, and we invest it in books, courses, subscriptions, etc. We also reward our hard work by funding various trips, date nights, outfits, home renovations, etc. with the 10% that we take out of our income for lifestyle.

**STEP FIVE: Save 3 Months of Expenses in a Fully Funded Emergency Fund**  
The emergency fund is separate from the three months of runway in that we hope never to touch it. It exists purely to provide a buffer against the unknown. Let's say an unexpected event prompts us to spend $10k. We could take care of the emergency without reducing any of the time we have provided by our runway.

**STEP SIX: Commit All Remaining Cashflow to the War Chest**  
With three months of runway, a fully funded emergency fund, and new tactics gained through personal development, I feel as though I have an unfair advantage when it comes to finding and negotiating deals. I'm not in a rush to risk buying a bad deal, I can afford to close even if my creative financing falls through, and I'm protected against any unforeseen obstacles that may arise at home. What's more, is that my deals get bigger and bigger, but my expenses stay the same.

His - 401k: $192 // Ind. Brok: $304k // Roth IRA: $32k // Checking: $21k // HSA: $10k = $559k

Total Combined NW: $1.03M

In 2022, I invested $122k and my fianc√© invested ~100k. So let‚Äôs just say we invested over $200k combined.

I am 30 years old, work in marketing, and now earn $291k total comp ($200k base, $82k cash bonus, $9k company stock). My fianc√© is 34 and earns $260k per year. We split expenses 50/50, don‚Äôt own a house or a car, and don‚Äôt want kids.

We initially reached millionaire status over the summer and celebrated by drinking a cheap bottle of wine. We were on cloud nine for about a week and then returned to our baseline level of happiness. In terms of our RE number, we still haven‚Äôt landed on a number we can both agree on. He still wants to aim for $10M to help ease the feeling of uncertainty during market fluctuations. For instance, if the market drops 50%, we wouldn‚Äôt have to change our lifestyle. But I would argue we could achieve the same between a $3M-$5M NW. We anticipate spending up to $120k/year in retirement (this includes healthcare and increased vacation spend) so at a min we‚Äôd need $3M to live an upgraded version of our current lifestyle. I simply don‚Äôt want to work longer than I need to. At the end of the day, I think this is a good problem to have. I know we‚Äôll eventually reach a compromise.

From a career standpoint, you may have noticed that I switched jobs. Well, I finally made it to big tech and negotiated hard for my compensation package. The job‚Äôs fine. Not as exciting as my last role, but I‚Äôm learning some interesting things. One of my goals was to work at a tech company. Now that I've achieved it, I‚Äôm not sure what I want to do next with my career. As our NW grows, I no longer care about moving up the corporate ladder. I‚Äôve been more interested in my creative hobbies, travel plans, and things we can start doing now before reaching FI (e.g., videography, photography, exercise more, travel more, etc.). I guess I sense our corporate careers are nearing an end as we get closer to FI. I'm slowing down on the corporate hamster wheel and I don‚Äôt hate it.

As mentioned earlier, I‚Äôm newly engaged and can‚Äôt wait to marry the love of my life. We don‚Äôt care much for jewelry so I asked for a cheaper gem instead of a diamond ring. He wants a rubber ring. Our thinking is that if we lose them, they can easily be replaced without breaking the bank. Also, the thought of my fianc√© spending thousands on a ring made me feel queasy so we agreed to spend more on our honeymoon. We haven‚Äôt picked a date yet, but plan to marry in 2024. We may have a small dinner party (no wedding) after we elope with no more than 20 relatives. Once we leave corporate America, we plan to slow travel around the world while pursuing our hobbies in more depth.

No one in our family knows about our millionaire status. They know that we invest and are interested in financial independence, but no one has expressed particular interest. I prefer it this way as I‚Äôve read stories of relationships changing for the worse after a person‚Äôs wealth is revealed. Otherwise, I‚Äôve been setting healthy boundaries with my family (particularly my emotionally unstable mother) and I think I‚Äôm mentally better for it. While I‚Äôll never forget my troubled past, I‚Äôm in a much better place mentally, emotionally, and financially. I refuse to let that define me for the rest of my life. I‚Äôve healed and am ready to live my best life with my soon-to-be husband.

Things are still stable on the mental front. I‚Äôve reached a point where I couldn‚Äôt care less if I get laid off. I have no doubt that I will be able to find another job eventually. Who knows, maybe I‚Äôll double down on one of my hobbies instead and see where it takes me. This mindset makes me feel incredibly powerful as if we‚Äôve already reached FI.

I‚Äôm still cycling indoors 3-4x per week and lifting weights 2x per week. I plan to continue doing this, if not more, in retirement.

While no one knows what the future holds, I expect there to be some form of a recession coming. I may get laid off and that would be totally fine because I have enough invested/saved to weather the storm for multiple years and have full confidence in my ability to eventually find another job. It also helps having a partner who works too.

Anyway, here are some lessons we learned that you may want to keep in mind and/or apply to your FI journey:

‚Ä¢ Celebrate every NW milestone. You‚Äôve earned it

‚Ä¢ Your past does not define you or your future

‚Ä¢ The closer you get to FI, the less f*cks you‚Äôll give

‚Ä¢ Explore hobbies and practice healthy habits before reaching FI (ideally 2-3 years beforehand)

Remember, none our progress happened overnight. It took a lot of luck and consistency to help us reach this point. However, I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt acknowledge the privilege we now have as adults. That‚Äôs not lost on us and we (especially myself) are learning how to navigate that.

I am currently maxing out my 401k and can‚Äôt contribute to a Roth IRA. I would like to FIRE in 20-30 years, but anticipate making less money in 10 years and in retirement. Work offers an in-plan conversion for after-tax 401k to Roth which I just sort of opted for without much thought, but I am now worried about access to some of the money for a house payment in a few years/FIRE withdrawal access. 

Given the above, should I quit the automatic conversion and stop doing after-tax 401k-&gt; Roth, and just put this stuff into a brokerage account? It sounds like yes but I‚Äôd like to know if I‚Äôm missing something. Thank you.",confused about after-tax contributions,1672699716

286,financialindependence,"Family dynamics and money is always hard. 

My grandmother is widowed, my dad manages her finances in a high level way and he also has a sister (my aunt).

My aunt has been given much of my grandmothers jewelry and randomly sums of money - like $40k+ for her house renovations. My aunt is retired and successful. I also found out my aunt's daughter (my cousin) has received an heirloom ring (with rubies, diamonds...etc) from my grandmother, money to buy more land, a laptop...etc. and since she has kids my grandmother flies her out to visits and spends money on them. And who knows what else! 

I have received nothing from my grandmother and it's awkward as I am not sure how best to approach it. I wish my dad would talk w/ my aunt and grandmother and figure out a way to better manage who gets what. They all have kids so they see her more often and I think there is favoritism. I am going to visit her in a few months and am wondering how I can best handle this situation? I never even got a christmas card or anything from her. She could easily send all of her grandchildren a few hundred to a thousand dollars a year for christmas, because she also is legally required to spend a certain amount of money per year because of her age apparently. She has a lot of money, it would be nice to receive some of it from her, because I know my aunt's side is getting stuff as well. I also would love some heirloom jewelry to pass down and remember her by. 

I think mostly my dad and aunt will get her inheritance, but while she is alive and spending money on others and has lots of money to spend, I wish it was more fairly managed.

288,financialindependence,"I made some graphs and wanted to share because I‚Äôve been so excited for all the data to come in! 

Both graphs made with Sankeymatic --&gt; [https://imgur.com/a/V3pPL2t](https://imgur.com/a/V3pPL2t)

I (34M) am a Nurse Anesthetist out of school for two years now. I have a young child and am with 36F SAHM spouse. We have zero student/car/credit card  debt. Credit card is paid in full every month. We have a house loan which is our only debt. My gross income this  year was about 220k. My income is projected to be 260-270k in 2023. 

Some notes -  

I consider the way we live to be rather modest. And even though I got a  substantial pay raise a couple years go, we largely live the same way we  did five years ago when I was an RN making 50k per year, with the  exception that we now buy higher quality food and will travel a bit  more. What we don‚Äôt spend on cost of living, as you can see, gets  invested. Index fund of choice is VTSAX. We still meal prep for my five work meals per week, and we both drive 20 year old reliable vehicles, kid is in public school. 

At this rate I'm thinking we will hit financial independence in around 6-7 years at which point I plan to cut back on work a little bit and travel more. Maybe I'll branch out and open a pizzeria/pinball joint. Don't know. I'm thinking our number needs to be roughly 1 million to 1.2 million, but I also want to pay our house completely off so that 18 grand is freed up, lowering annual expenditures. I think that this will be similar to how it was when I was in grad school paying tuition with knowing the final cost number. The closer we get to it, the more exact we'll be able to pinpoint what it will be. In any case, it does not change what we're doing now. 

Our expenses this year were 76k, but we also had about 5 grand in car expenses that are not typical in a given year. We had just been abusing the vehicles while I was in school. Our shopping expenses could be cut some too. With taking the mortgage out would put us around 50k per year which would be 1.25 million. But I'd probably still work some and even if I were to work just 2-3 months a year, it would cover 100% of those living expenses with my salary. That's the tentative plan anyway. We are happy now, and are squarely in the boring middle part of our journey.

* 2022: $81,077.65 / $31,181.83

 GENERAL 

* 27m, single, no kids
* I live in rural WV so yes, my rent and utilities combine to only about \~$700/month
* I don't budget but I do write down every penny I spend and then take about 30 minutes at the end of each month combining it into a few charts on google sheets, I don't feel I spend too much that warrants a real budget. I'm pretty naturally frugal. I track NW monthly in these charts as well.
* I paid off my car this year!! Maxed 403b, Roth IRA, I-bonds. This is the first year I have ever been close to maxing these retirement accounts available to me and I am stoked. Next year I get an HSA so that's to be added to the list!
* in 2020 as I began investing, I learned a harsh lesson about single stocks. Invested about $6000 into my Roth IRA, thinking I could make some tax-free gains. In the beginning, I was up about $5000 in a few weeks, and thought this was great! I'm the smartest! Unfortunately I was caught bag-holding and that +$5000 quickly became -$5000. Learned a great deal from that, with a non-tax-harvestable $5000 loss. Now we are index fund gang for life.

&amp;#x200B;

 HISTORY and INCOME

* Divorced parents and 3 other siblings. Attempted to join the military out of high-school but could not do to medical issues. Mom stayed at home, dad construction. Not poor, but close. A fond memory I recall is ""loaning"" my dad $500 I got for my 13th birthday party ""or we wouldn't be able to go to vacation for the 2nd year in a row and it would be my fault."" Never saw that money back, who'da thunk! Parents had their addictions and dad was in-and-out of jail occasionally in my teens. Better now and have a good relationship, but watching my parents grow up very much cemented the idea that I was going to do better. Parents have 0 savings and I am still asked to loan them money at least monthly. I will give my (possible, future) kids better.
* 2018 - Graduated college Summer of '18 with a Bachelor's, unfortunately a mostly useless degree without going on further into a masters/etc. First and only child to go to/graduate college so far. Mom remarried in my first year of college to a gentleman making about 100k which unfortunately counted towards my FAFSA and I wasn't eligible for much aid, despite not getting assistance from my step-dad financially, which I wouldn't expect! I worked part time throughout school to pay what I could/rent and graduated with about 55k in student loans. Moved to WV for a change in scenery and to start work. Made about $15/hour for the final few months, lived with a roommate.
* 2019 - In the same position, continued to work for the whole year with no change, maybe 45-50 hours a week on average.
* 2020 - Decided $15/hour wasn't enough with a Bachelor's and 50k student debt. Found a year-long program that would increase my income to about 55k base. Worked about 30hours/week while in school 40hours/week for the program. 
* 2021 - Graduated mid '21 from the program, moved about an hour or so for the new job. $27/hour. Nice, nearly doubled my income! First paycheck hit and I remember it being more than I would make working 20 hours of overtime on previous job. Felt so good! Was fast approaching $0 NW and excited.
* 2022 - Came off probationary period for work, proved I could do what I needed and became independent in work. Raise to base $29/hour. Solid amount of overtime available. On call periodically, I pick it up frequently from coworkers because I have the time to work now. I probably average 50hours/week currently and 10 on call/week!

FIRE TARGET and PLANS:

I haven't built the life I want to live yet. I'm considering moving to a HCOL state where rent runs about $1200/month and remaining around 70-80k/pay. This will be a pay-cut unless I can find a job that offers more income, but right now I'm pretty bored living where I am. I live about an hour from closest friends and two hours from family. This move would put me squarely in the middle of a dozen friends, and I'm considering it as a big QOL improvement. My current goal FIRE amount is $1.5mm. This may change when/if I have kids.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to move it to my ROTH IRA so that I don‚Äôt have a tax bill in retirement and because of issues with Target Date Retirement Funds in taxable brokerages.

294,financialindependence,"So here is what I have/will have in 2023 in addition to the $20k:
- Emergency fund for 6-8 months 

- Maxed Roth IRA
- Maxed HSA (single)
- 401k up to match

- $20k in I-Bonds (12months; not funded for 2023) 
- $50k in HYSA (3.3% atm)
- $8k checking

Debts:
- *$50k student loans (federal ~6.3% avg)*
- $20k auto loan 

Assume my pay for 2023 is enough to pay for my monthly expenses + contribute to the tax-deferred retirements. That‚Äôs it. 
Also assume the E-fund is NOT at play (can‚Äôt touch it unless I truly need it). 

The specific number is because I had to buy a new car and the auto loan was for $19800 at 5.25% for 60 months. ($377/month for $2750 in total interest over 60 months) 

1. I need to figure out if and when I should just pay off the auto loan with the cash I have. 

2. Until I should pay off the auto loan, where should I keep this money? Ideally I‚Äôd like to use that money to at least break even on the interest 

3. The reason I have cash in HYSA is because I plan to pay off my student loans when the time comes. Currently deferred/no interest accruing or payments required until June. 
- It appears with the auto loan now I won‚Äôt be able to fully pay off the student loans but there‚Äôs about $10k that‚Äôs at 3.5% and $20k at &gt;6.5%; the rest are in between. 

Some ideas i have had includes leaving the money in the HYSA, possible ‚Äúchurning‚Äù (w/ bank &amp; CC promos) to help minimize the interest accrued, and sticking bits into I-bonds as the initial $20k is almost at &gt;1 year (it‚Äôs 20k because I gave 10k to my mom to open for me).",Help brother maximize $19800,1672673521

313,financialindependence,"Retirement planning is based on having a SWR that meets your expenses.  I have never had a budget and had always ballparked my expenses at about 50K.  That made my retirement projections shaky.   I figured I needed an accurate picture of my spending so I could plan my retirement better.  This year I did an experiment and I wrote down every penny I spent, all year, using a google spreadsheet on my phone.   Here is what I learned.

I live in a MCOL city on the East Coast in a 3BR/2.5Ba Single Family home.  I had been projecting an annual spend of about 50K in retirement.  I ended up spending more than that.   

2022 Total: 59250.93.  

High (November): 8486.55

Low (December): 2486.86.  

Average: 4960.08. 

Clearly I spent more than my projected 50K, so that's good to know.  That will inform my baseline SWR for year one of retirement.  My future calculations will use a SWR of 60K.

However, why I ended up spending more than 50K this year was interesting. 

An unexpected consequence of tracking every penny was that I realized that I was spending less than I should.  Knowing this year's spending would affect my income in retirement made me spend more, not less.  I wanted an accurate cost of what I consider living well.  So, that 59K I spent included not only the minimum expenses, but also 16K of intermittent purchases and house expenses that come up:

two guitars (5000)

one week trip in the summer (1500) 

a new laptop (1000) 

a new dishwasher (700)

a new fridge (1200)

copay for braces for a kid (2600)

three weeks in Paris (about 4000).  

Some of that, like the braces and the dishwasher are expenses that could not be easily avoided, but everything else was extra, and represented to me the cost of living well.  So I now know that 60K feels like living well, and also that the minimum I could survive on in a year I needed to tighten my belt is more like 45K.  It wouldn't be living well, but in a market downturn, I could spend less if I needed to.

So for me at least, once I was recording every penny spent, I realized I could spend more and meet my savings goals.  This year I made the most I'd ever made and also saved the most I've ever saved.  I made 194K.   I maxed out my 403b/IRA/SEP IRA/457b/401a, made mandatory pension contributions and put a large chunk into my taxable brokerage.  In total, I saved 110,345, for a savings rate of 57%.  I also received an inheritance of 58K and was able to invest another 47K of college money that my kid didn't need because she got a scholarship, so the total I put into investments this year was 215,345.  

I see no need to continue recording every penny spent this year.  In fact, I just got curly fries and milkshakes from Arby's and didn't write down how much it cost.  Yay!

But writing down every penny spent in 2023 not only gave me an idea of what a very comfortable SWR would be in retirement, it taught me I could spent a bit more and still make my goals.

**INTRO**

Are  you tired of living paycheck to paycheck and ready to take control of  your personal finances? Then it's time to create a smart personal  finance plan that will help you save and reach your financial goals!  Read on to learn how you can craft a budget, build your savings, and  create a plan for long-term success!

**METHOD**

Creating  a smart personal finance plan is an important step in taking control of  your financial life. It will help you set goals, stay organized, and  track your progress. With the right plan in place, you can make better  financial decisions that will put you on the path to financial success.

In  this blog, we will discuss how to create a smart personal finance plan  that will help you reach your financial goals. We will cover topics such  as setting financial goals, budgeting, tracking your spending, and  investing for the future.

Setting Financial Goals

The  first step in creating your personal finance plan is to set financial  goals. These goals should be realistic, measurable, and achievable. When  setting financial goals, it is important to consider both short-term  and long-term goals. Short-term goals are typically those that can be  achieved within the next year. Examples of short-term goals could  include paying off a credit card balance in full, increasing your  savings rate, or reducing your spending. Long-term goals are those that  you hope to achieve in the future, such as retirement planning or buying  a house.

When setting financial  goals, it is important to consider both your current financial situation  and your long-term goals. Consider the following questions when setting  your financial goals:

‚Ä¢ What do I want to accomplish financially?

‚Ä¢ What are my financial priorities?

‚Ä¢ What resources do I have available to reach my financial goals?

Once you have identified your financial goals, you can begin to develop a plan to achieve them.

Budgeting

Budgeting  is an essential tool for achieving your financial goals. It allows you  to track your income and expenses, and make sure you are spending within  your means. When creating a budget, it is important to consider your  current income, expenses, and financial goals.

Start  by listing all of your income sources and all of your expenses. Be sure  to include both fixed and variable expenses, such as rent or mortgage  payments, utilities, groceries, and entertainment. Once you have a clear  picture of your income and expenses, you can begin to create a budget.

When  creating a budget, it is important to make sure you are living within  your means. This means that you should not be spending more than you  earn. If you find that you are spending more than you earn, you may need  to make some adjustments to your budget. Consider reducing your  spending, increasing your income, or finding ways to save money.

Tracking Your Spending

Tracking  your spending is an important part of managing your finances. It helps  you identify where your money is going and make adjustments to stay on  track. There are a variety of tools and apps available to help you track  your spending.

First, create a  list of all of your expenses, including fixed and variable expenses.  This will give you an idea of where your money is going each month.  Then, use budgeting apps or online banking services to track your  spending. These tools can help you visualize your spending and identify  areas where you can make adjustments.

Investing for the Future

Investing  for the future is an important part of any personal finance plan.  Investing can help you reach your long-term financial goals and build  wealth over time. Investing is more than just buying stocks and bonds.  It includes a variety of strategies, such as saving for retirement,  starting an emergency fund, or investing in real estate.

When  investing for the future, it is important to consider both your risk  tolerance and time horizon. Your risk tolerance is the amount of risk  you are willing to take when investing. Your time horizon is the amount  of time you plan to invest for. These factors will help you determine  the best investment strategies for your personal financial plan.

Final Thoughts

Creating  a smart personal finance plan is an important step in taking control of  your financial life. By setting realistic goals, budgeting, tracking  your spending, and investing for the future, you can make better  financial decisions and achieve long-term financial success. With the  right plan in place, you can take control of your financial future.

**INTERESTING FACTS**

When  it comes to personal finance, it is important to understand the  different types of investments available. Investing in stocks and bonds  is one way to build wealth over time, but there are other investments  that can be a part of a smart personal finance plan. Here are some other  investments to consider:

‚Ä¢ Real  Estate: Investing in real estate can be a great way to build wealth. It  can also provide a steady stream of income in the form of rental  payments.

‚Ä¢ Mutual Funds: Mutual  funds are a type of investment that pools money from multiple investors.  They are professionally managed and can provide a diversified  portfolio.

‚Ä¢ Exchange Traded Funds  (ETFs): ETFs are a type of investment that tracks a specific index or  market. They are typically more affordable than mutual funds and provide  investors with higher returns.

‚Ä¢ Commodities: Investing in commodities such as gold, oil, or other metals can be a great way to hedge against inflation.

318,financialindependence,"Note: the purpose of this post is *not* to criticize folks for their purchasing decisions, only to describe a mentality that was once foreign to me.

I've realized the reason so many of my coworkers feel poor is their life expectations are different than mine.

I come from a frugal family and was elated when I began making \~$100k/yr. I regularly found my coworkers talk about how they couldn't afford basic things. Many of them had no NW despite working their $100k+/yr job for over a decade. At the time I wondered, ""How is that possible?"" I genuinely couldn't spend that much money if I tried.

I've realized its because of their expectations in life: maybe private school for all their kids, a big home in their favorite location, nice cars or expensive wine. And each item my coworkers added to their list of life expectations negatively affected their outlook on their personal finances.

Of course, that's not to say life expectations are bad. Everyone would argue some expectations in life (food, water) are justified and others are not ($1bn McMansion and a private island). Where you draw the line is up to you. But where your line is drawn affects your outlook on your personal finances.

322,financialindependence,"Making money is important to me, but I don't need 200K/year. I do however want a safe job with good work life balance and decent pay. I want to be able to spend a decent amount of my life making friendships and spending time with friends.

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

Which path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?

340,financialindependence,"So I‚Äôm currently 17 years old, and I was recently accepted into a university early decision. I looked onto my college‚Äôs website, and I found out that my tuition will be about $80k a year (including housing + meals), and I assume my family will spend money to bring me home when school is out. I had several conversations with my mother about how exactly I will pay for school, and she said that the majority of my tuition will be payed through a trust fund that my father left me before he passed away.
For most of my life, I chose not to ask my mother about the trust because I always heard her complain about how the long court battle she had trying to uphold the clause of her divorce agreement saying that if either she or my dad were to pass away before I was 18, they would leave all their money to me, but my father instead tried to leave *some* money to his friends and establish his lawyer friend as my trustee. Apparently, the fight got pretty nasty, and even though my mother was named a trustee by a judge later on, my dad‚Äôs lawyer friend used money from my trust fund to pay for his defense in the lawsuit. My mom also objected to paying someone to manage my stocks and bonds while we have family who are very successful hedge fund workers.
After sitting down with my mom, I discovered that my trust fund is currently worth about $1.4 million in various stocks and bonds. The fund was set up about 3-4 years ago at around $1.1 million, and it has paid my $40-45k tuition at private school since then, and I guess it makes sense that its still gaining money if the annual return for this year was about 5.3% or $72k. I did see that the fund was worth about $1.8 million a year ago, but my hedge fund friend explained that some stocks have gone down in the past year, and they will for a bit in the future. The fund, however, is still where it was 2 years ago, and that‚Äôs after my mom took out $150-$200k to pay for expenses.
My real question is what should I expect the next ‚Äúchanges‚Äù to my trust to look like, because even though my mother told me it will dissolve and ownership will be mine at around age 23, the trust was set up entirely for EDUCATION. Based on the way my mom talked about it, she didn‚Äôt expect me to have much of anything left by the time I finish college (and possibly grad school) since my trust has fluctuated a bit. I still thought that if I can generate $72k a year from the trust, and combine it with the $30-40k from my Mom‚Äôs 529, I wouldn‚Äôt see much of a change compared to now, and I could have $1 million by the time I‚Äôm 23.

356,financialindependence," This will be cross posted in a few FIRE related reddits, so if you see it somewhere else, nothing is different. 

I always begin these updates with the same disclaimer that I don't have a specific FIRE date since I was self employed before retirement and slowly dissolved my business over time and started investing in real estate. I use the 2010 time frame for reference because it is around the time I hired a property manager (thus leaving me zero active work to do unless I choose), but it certainly isn't exact.

This isn't meant as a comparison to anyone else. This is strictly provided to the FIRE community because I know I would have liked to have seen real world example of how people handle their finances when I was trying to figure all this out many years ago. Another reason I post these is to show there is more than one way to do FIRE. I was able to accomplish this without ever making a high income during my working years. I simply lived very frugally and put the money I saved into individual stocks (hey, it was 80s - 90s...I didn't know better and stock investing was a completely different animal back then) and then converted that to buying rental properties in a low cost of living area in the 2000s.

Quick stats: I'm 57, single, no kid's, about 12 years post FIRE.

**WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE MY LAST UPDATE**

Last update had some major changes, but not so much this time other than a few book keeping notes to tidy up some math. 

Had just bought a new car in the last update, a  2022 Hybrid Elantra, and had planned to pay it off in cash after getting the financing rebate. Right before the payoff I found out a roof needed repair and I wasn't going to be able to cash flow it without a margin loan against my stock that would be much higher than the car loan at 2.75%, so I decided to keep it. 4 roofs later, I still have the loan, lol. The car IS so far doing as expected and getting me over the 60mpg I planned. The gas savings combined with the 10 year bumper to bumper warranty SHOULD result in an overall savings vs. gas and repairs to my previous drivers. Most of those are collector cars, so I'll be selling them off to help pay the expense of the new car. Anyway, that is about $650 per month on a 4 year loan. So that will be reflected in my financials now. 

The house cleaner mentioned previously moved away...and I haven't bothered to replace her.

I've continued to grow the real estate business, with several new projects now in the works keeping my team busy...while I sit around and enjoy the retired life, lol. In fairness, I do look at potential houses in person and discuss what I want done with my team, but after that I rarely have any hands on involvement outside of the rare big picture decision.

**INCOME**

Net income for the year from all income streams after all expenses is right at $143,000 This is mostly rental income with some dividends (about $15,000) thrown in. 

**GROWTH AND NET WORTH**

My growth in my investments so far this year. Keep in mind this numbers reflect the sharp downturn in the markets.

Total invested this year $132,000. (Yes, that left me $11,000 to live on. That will be addressed below)

Because I hold some long term leverage in stocks, it was pretty brutal this year, and I lost a total of just shy of $275,000 in the stock market. Leaving me with a stock balance of right at $364,000. Luckily my other investments did well and continued to grow. 

Fundrise account grew about $8200 in appreciation for a return of right at 9.3% and leaving a balance of right at $109,000 (I know that math looks strange, but I invested $24K throughout the year)...and that should get better at the final adjustments are not yet in for the last quarter. 

My real estate (rentals) is very difficult to estimate since I have partners on some of the houses and some I own outright. Not to mention it isn't a liquid asset. I usually just judge it by the income it produces...that being said it does have a value that adds to my net worth. I'll be conservative and say my real estate portfolio is worth $2M - $2.5M. I do not hold debt on the portfolio. Everything is owned outright without loans of any sort. This includes some sharp increases in property values over the past couple of years. I don't think it has changed substantially since the last update. 

My personal property (the house and 10 acres of land I live on) is worth about $450k - $500k...again as a conservative estimate. A house similar to mine, but in my opinion not quite as appealing, recently sold for over $750,000.

I have misc. accounts totaling around $45K...this is a small Acorn account, another stock account I use for experiments in investing, and my liquid accounts that I use for personal and business expenses. I keep more in a ""cash"" bank account than most because I need to cover business expenses. I try to keep around $20K in there, but it will fluctuate greatly throughout the month to as low as $7 or 8K, to sometimes as high as $30k. I currently have another $4k in a money market fund. I have this for quick liquidity when needed. This also varies greatly and will be as high as $50K at times.

Not going to bother with my cars and other misc. on this update. This brings my total net worth as of this update to around $3,000,000 (using the conservative estimates above)- $3,500,000. So, stocks are down since last update, real estate is about even, so when you account for the money invested my net worth is down slightly since the last update, but not substantially.

**EXPENSES**

I spent a total average of $672 per month on all non business related expenses in the first half of the year. The car about doubled it  in the last half of the year. This came in over my previous goal of $10K per year with total spent on typical stuff at $11,245. In late October I was hiking near Eureka Springs, AR and found a cat quite literally on her death bed. Skin and bones...too weak to even really move. So I  decided to try to save her if I could. Right now she is still alive, and has about $3000 in vet bills and counting. So....that brings my total spent this year to $14,245 and far exceeds my non investment spending in previous years of retirement. 

These numbers are updated to reflect the current expenses, even though these are some fairly recent changes.

Phone/Internet $25 (Visible wireless with unlimited hotspot for internet)

Insurance on my cars $125 (3 cars liability only, 1 full coverage)

Food/groceries $100 (I've done some detailed food budget breakdowns if you're curious how I keep this so low)

Electric $125 - $150 (average throughout the year/ all electric house)

I have my own well and septic tank, so no bills for water, sewerage, and trash.

Gas for cars $25 - $50. I spent quite a bit more on gas in the last few months before buying the hybrid, so my gas budget went up quite a bit. It was about $100 - $150 before buying the hybrid. This is mainly due to looking at more houses for the business, semi local trips for hiking/and or entertainment. (everything within 100 miles, but it does add up)

Entertainment $100. I hate to give this it's own line in the budget, but I do sometimes spend on entertainment, so although this is no way a true reflection of what I spent last year, I am including it because everyone asks, lol. Most of my entertainment ends up being ""free"" or nearly free other than the gas it takes to go places. Last year my out of pocket on entertainment was probably about $300 for a season pass to Silver Dollar City, and several cave tours with a friend from out of town. Other than that it was mostly gas to get to some fun hiking spots. 

Health Insurance is a free (for now) catastrophic plan. Thanks to all my real estate deductions I get to write off most of my income, leaving me just able to qualify for the absolute worst plan available in my state for free. Of course, if one little thing goes wrong at tax time and I step over the threshold at the end of the year, that could change and I'll be left paying for a plan I've never used.

I think next year I'll be looking at about $15,000 goal for total spent if I don't take on another cat on her deathbed...or if this one doesn't cost me another $5k. 

I think that covers where things are now.

**WHY DON'T I SPEND MORE?**

I started including this section because I was asked about it so much. Same as last update, so nothing new here.

I get asked this a lot. Why am I still trying to accumulate wealth 10 + years after I retired? Well, I'm still relatively young, and I have some big future goals that includes a large animal sanctuary with its own vet clinic and vegan restaurant. Even though I already have about 40 acres lined up for it, it is going to take a long time to get all the infrastructure in place. It might be 5 -10 years before it actually opens. I'm hoping to build as much as I can in the meantime.

I'm also just frugal by nature. Most of the stuff I enjoy is free or nearly free. Hiking trails, video games, TV, movies, diving down rabbit holes of whatever interest me at the time, etc. Some of my hobbies even make me money. I've managed to buy cars that appreciate. I happen to be a decent poker player. My watches have done really well...same with my art collection.

I don't live like a pauper. I live alone in a 4000 sq ft Mid Century house built into a cliff overlooking a river and beautiful valley with an indoor pool...so don't think my frugality always comes at the cost of the finer things. It is true until I recently bought my dream house I lived in a very modest house most people wouldn't associate with a millionaire (that house now rents for $750 a month), but I was patient and wanted to find the perfect house before I bothered to move. As I briefly mentioned before I have nice things like collector cars, art, watches, etc....I just try to spend as little as possible on depreciating assets or things like food. I appreciate good food, but being vegan makes it hard to eat out in my area. That is probably an understatement. There are maybe a handful of places I can eat at all (at least with more than salad as an option), and most of those only have one or two items on the menu I can eat. So I'd rather prepare great meals at home from cheap ingredients. I've gone into details in other posts about how I shop and prepare food, so won't make this post any longer doing it again.

As always, I'll try to answer any questions you might have. Thanks for reading such a long post!!",12 Years post FIRE update,1672437452

361,financialindependence,"I'm 26 and male, I live in Utah, and I've got a job I enjoy doing

I make $28 an hour, 56k annually. There is room to grow with this company that I'm working for as it's a smaller company turning into a large company. I've made myself very valuable to the company over the years and have helped it grow quite a bit over the course of the 6-7 years that I've worked here. I don't have much job history other than this current job. However, I do have a lot of experience now in IT, management, and administrative type work. I'm a jack of all trades but a master of none. For administrative type work, I single handedly do things like create workflows for different departments in the company so they work smoothly, or create a system that keeps track of production better, or find ways to fix communication issues between departments; stuff like that. When I was first employed, I was only making around $11 an hour and so I've gained a pretty significant increase in pay over those 6-7 years.

I currently live in a studio apartment and pay about $1100 per month in rent. Other expenses such as my car loan, car insurance, health insurance, and dental insurance, add up to about $550 per month. I'm close to paying off my car and so the total would drop to $400 per month.

I'm not married and have no dependants (I don't have much to offer a spouse anyway at the moment. But that's a different discussion)

I don't have a degree and I'm not currently going to school.

I have an emergency savings with about 5k in it.

Im not currently investing in any kind of Roth or 401k.

My credit score is 750 (I actually don't have a credit card. I've been building my credit with my car payment. It's not that I'm scared of getting a credit card, I just don't really care for it.)

Now that all the basics have been explained, time for my question. As stated in the title, I have no idea what I should be doing right now. The housing market in Utah at the moment costs 300k for a crack house in the ghetto and I don't know if I can afford that with my annual salary of 56k. I'm really stuck on what I should be doing. Should I be trying to prioritize making money? Do I go to school? (I hate school with a passion but I love learning.) I really want to purchase a home instead of wasting money on rent at an apartment. I was thinking of moving back home with my parents to save money for a house but they live 1 1/2 hrs away from my work. 

I don't really know a whole lot about anything if I'm being honest. I know what a 401k is, and I know what a Roth is. I grew up with my parents flipping houses and things of that nature so I'm a little bit familiar with how you would purchase a house, fix it up, then sell it and use the money you make as a down payment on your next house. But other than those things, I don't know a whole lot. I also don't want to spend a quarter million on a house where dirty Mike and the boys used to live. I was thinking of, perhaps, flipping houses similarly to how my parents did it. However, like I mentioned before, it's like 300k for a destroyed starter home.

I'm just stuck. I have no idea what to do and I'm just currently floating day by day and it's starting to bug me. The only real goals I have in life is to have a simple middle class house, a cute family, and to have extra spending money where I could just blow $2000 every once in awhile on something like a new pc. That's my dream.

What would your guys advice be? What should I do? Because I have no idea what to do. Sometimes I feel like I'm too old now to start doing anything.

However, now with 286k capital available, would it not make more sense to wipe out the mortgage directly? Excluding early repayment fees etc.. or should one keep the 286k and use the growth to fund the recurring monthly mortgage repayments for the next 25 years?

More growth might be possible by retaining the money yourself vs the mortgage interest saving. However on the other hand you could wipe out a 25 year liability and now your portfolio target can be ca. 300k smaller?

373,financialindependence,"**TLDR:** If the goal of becoming financially independent by establishing an organically generated cash flow (through labors of love and investments) more in line with the FIRE or FILE concept? Also, should I prioritize investing in income generating investments over growth? 

Hey all,

I hope all is well! I'm just getting seriously into the idea of early financial independence. I believe that there are two kinds of retirees; (1) those who want enough money to do nothing but live a life of leisure, and (2) those who enjoy being productive but want the kind of control over their work life that typically only financial independence can bring. I consider myself to be in the later category, to me financial independence is defined simply as being financially self-sufficient whether that be through investments or money earned through a labor of love on your own terms. I have read a little bit about the FI/RE movement and the FI/LE movement (Financial Independence Live Early). A non-traditional financial life intrigues me. 

I'm currently 34 years old. My current plan is to save for a traditional retirement to support myself after age 65, and then throw everything else that I have into achieving independence between now and then through organically generated income from investments and developing businesses in areas that interest me. Eventually the dream is to make enough money through investments and labors of love in the mid-term where I could quit my job to pursue those full-time. 

While the concept of building a nest egg large enough where I could simply say ""I'm done"" is tempting, it seems to me that the kind of money needed to do that is not obtainable without, in my opinion, being unacceptably frugal and accepting a sub-optimal lifestyle. I figure I would need about $1.5 - 2.0 million dollars saved up in order to live the lifestyle I want from age 45-65 until retirement without working. This is pretty hard to accomplish in the 11 years between now and age 45. Establishing a livable income through various sources including labors of love, say $5k/mo seems much more palatable. Especially since, I don't really want to stop working altogether when I 'retire'. 

Is this more consistent with the FIRE or FILE concept or is it more of a hybrid ? Also, with the goal of establishing consistent income in the mid-term and not wanting to ""Draw down"" a nest egg, should I prioritize in investing in income generating investments over growth based investments?

386,financialindependence,"Good morning FI community,

I advise being very careful when placing any specific lot trades with Fidelity - track the lots, screenshot/video your trades, and keep an accounting of your total shares sold somehow.

I've just gotten off the phone escalating a trade dispute with Fidelity and want to warn other folks so they don't have the same issue I am experiencing. 

Fidelity's tax lot trading system is not working properly. The last 2 days I have been selling VTI and VXUS and only selecting lots that showed unrealized losses, in an attempt to 0 out my gains from earlier this year and reduce my income by $3K. 

I have been investing daily-weekly for over a decade and thus hundreds of lots. I am not new to the Fidelity system and in fact worked there for some time and very well versed in their online trading system. 

I started with $15K in gains I needed to negate and started selling lots sorted by greatest loss in VXUS and VTI and making corresponding occasional buys into ITOT and IXUS. I sold several pages/scrolls of the largest negative lots of both. To clarify, I was sorting the lots by amount of gains and losses. This puts the largest negative loss at the bottom of the list of lots. I would select the greatest loss first and working up for a few scrolls of the window, never getting into the unrealized positive gains, and placing the trades after 2-3 pages of lots were selected. 

The preview order page showed estimated losses on every trade I placed. I finished selling these lots over the past 2 days. Today I log in today and see extremely low balances of shares in VTI and VXUS. 

I call Fidelity and they review the orders and say lots were being sold for gains. The trader I spoke with told me that many orders placed had unrealized gains (not losses), and that I had a net gain through all of my trades of several thousand dollars. The trader I spoke with talked to their IT team and supervisor and have told me there is nothing they can do as the trades on their end do not reflect what I was selecting in the trade ticket for share selection.",Issues/Warning Regarding Tax Loss Harvesting on Fidelity Website,1672332448

Last year, I changed careers and became a software engineer in NYC. I basically tripled my income, and felt more confident in taking finances seriously. I got turned onto this sub + /r/personalfinance, which has been super helpful for actually learning the confusing world of finances.

Some things to note about my situation:

1. I live with my girlfriend in a 1br apartment, split rent equally
2. No kids, no pets
3. I do not need a car in my city
4. Have not included \~$2000 bonus and last paycheck taxes since it comes in on Friday.

Some things I learned and hope to fix next year:

1. I spent way too much on eating out and treating myself. I worked a lot of hours because I felt like I was behind my coworkers since I did a lot of self-study to get into the field, which ended up constraining the amount of time I had to cook. I am going to set more boundaries with work this year to hopefully get more time to cook groceries.
2. I do not know why my HRA didn't pay for anything. I am supposed to have a $500 HRA for my healthcare plan but I ended up paying everything myself... gotta talk to HR about that
3. I should have built a stronger emergency fund before buying stocks. I spent a lot of money on stocks at the height of the market in November/December 2021, which cost me a few thousand dollars. I am okay with this though because it is a long term investment. I am now working on getting a proper 6-month emergency fund first before doing any more post-tax investment.
4. Layoffs exist. I was lucky to keep my job after the tech decimation that occurred, gave me more insight into why an emergency fund is necessary.

I've been maxing out the federal limit on 401(k) and Roth IRA contributions for years, and am chewing on when it makes sense to pull back on those contributions to have more retirement. I've put together a simple [scenario analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z2O0YbCDp2a7bjg-KxSK3gCk6X2RDhG6W3ZvIKzsMlU/edit?usp=sharing) comparing one year of pre-tax 401(k) contributions with a 10% withdrawal penalty vs the same amount contributed to a traditional brokerage account. Salary and tax rate assumptions are based on my current earnings and location.

No matter how I tweak it, it seems like being able to reinvest the tax savings from the pre-tax 401(k) more than offsets the early withdrawal penalty, and this is not including any employer match on the 401(k). This would imply that it's better to continue to max out my 401(k) contributions, even if I think that I may need to withdraw early, and then only contribute to the taxable brokerage account when maxed.",Does a 401(k) with early withdrawals still make more sense than a taxable brokerage account?,1672241274

409,financialindependence,"Hello - I am writing with a question from Germany. 

My spouse is a U.S. citizen, we recently moved to Germany. Both my wife and I work for a German companies. Unfortunately, her bank (Charles Schwab) has informed her that she can no longer invest in Mutual Funds or ETFs using her Charles Schwab account, presumably due to compliance reasons. German financial services providers do not accept U.S. clients for any investment-type service, because of the U.S. taxes on world-wide incomes.

I am looking for a U.S. based financial service provider that offers basic investment services to U.S. citizens living in Europe. My wife has 0 interest in personal finance, but she has saved up about 200.000-300.000 USD just idling in her savings account. I would like her to invest that money in some basic financial products, ideally broad-based ETFs or Mutual funds. I am trying to find an online bank or online brokerage platform for her that is easy to use and secure. 

I also have a question about regulations that would apply in cases of bankruptcy. Would her investments be protected if her financial service provider goes tits up? In Germany cash deposit up until 100.000k are protected to a bank wide deposit insurance system. Investments in stocks, bonds and ETF are considered as ""special funds"" that are only administered by the financial service provide and will be returned to the client/owner in case of bankruptcy. What are the applicable U.S. regulations? I just want to make sure we are not losing all her money by investing it with an unreliable firm.

* The just started the IRA to Roth IRA conversion, but it won't finish until the first week of January i.e. next tax year.

* Background: school and college taught me nothing about making money. Economy class focused on the tax we all pay and how to not spend too much and all the other basic bullshit.
* Goals / reasons  
1. The ability to buy anything I need without having stress about money and guilt about how many hours of job-work it took me to make that money (FREEDOM). Currently, everything is way too expensive in my country and jobs don't pay enough.  
2. To help my family, my parents have never had much money but they have always been here for me, I would love to help them financially  
3. I've been interested in philantrophy since young age. I want to help the world around me and I believe I can best do it once I have alot of money. I'm aware there are other ways, but this is what I'm going for.  
4. And I just want to say, I'm not here for big houses or cars or any of that bullshit. I just want to make much money so I can live a normal life with no stress about not having money. In my personal life I'm very good at spending my money efficiently and only buying things that will really benefit my personal life relative to the cost. I don't buy stuff that I don't need.

* I tried google and youtube. But here, there is SO MUCH information that I get overwhelmed: there are 1000 ways to get rich, which one is better, which one is the best for me, what should I do? Which information that I find is correct and trustworthy, and which information in the internet is not correct? I can find alot of information online, but this is like a puzzle of 10 million pieces that seem impossible to put them together. I have seen so many youtube videos and ads about how to make money, but most of the time they are just talking empty stuff and not actually teaching me anything, or its a video that for some reason feels like they are trying to scam me... Basically there are millions of get rich guides on the internet, and I don't know how to navigate myself through all of this, I don't know which resources to trust and use and which resources to not trust and use.
* Books I haven't tried, I could, but I hate reading alot of text at once because of my short attention span, I'm also not willing to spend money before I know for sure that a book is really full of good information and trustworthy.

443,financialindependence," Leverage is the use of a small amount of resources, such as money or time, to produce a larger impact or result. It can be applied in personal finance, time management, and interpersonal relationships. In personal finance, leverage can be used to multiply the impact of an individual's financial resources and increase their returns on investment, but it can also involve additional risks. In time management, leverage can be used to focus on high-impact tasks and delegate or outsource lower-impact tasks to be more efficient and effective. In interpersonal relationships, leverage can be used to build strong relationships and use the resources and connections of others to open up new opportunities and expand influence. Overall, leverage is a powerful tool for maximizing the impact of resources and achieving greater results.

&amp;#x200B;

So I had some investments into growth stocks which turned out to be worst of my decision and hence I was looking to rebalance my portfolio and also do some tax loss harvesting with my income. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in on income tax state state and hence I only pay federal tax. I want to utilize $3K per year tax loss harvesting by selling those growth stocks. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Can I do this tax loss harvesting using turbotax (I am assuming it will be taken care of automatically by turbo tax once I fill in my W2's and 1099 (from brokerage account) ?

&amp;#x200B;

2) I DCA into couple of indexes(think VOO/VTI) every week. Do I need to make sure that my growth stock is not present in this large index to not present if I want to DCA and use TLH? Or is it advisable to not invest in such indexes for 60 days ? 

&amp;#x200B;

3) If my capital loss is &gt; 3K$ (let's say it is 5K) then how will the 2K get carried over to next year ? Again will turbotax take care of this automatically as mentioned in (1) or I need to do something specifically for this ?

The reason why I feel bad about this year is because my brokerage/401k has lost over 100k since end of 2021. I‚Äôve probably lost more than 35% of my portfolio when the market has been down 20%. I‚Äôve learned my lesson that investing in single stocks or hype mutual funds like those of Cathie wood are not the way to go. 

On the flip side, I‚Äôm thankful that I‚Äôve invested just as much on real estate (single family rentals) that are steadily yielding me a 10% cash on cash return. 

My question is, where do I go from here? Do I keep putting money in my brokerage (in index funds as market is down), or should I invest in real estate? Or should I aggressively pay off my loans? 

I feel like when I think about this, I always fear that my choice will be wrong and it may put me behind substantially. 

Anyone else feel this way? Any tips from someone who may have been in a similar situation? How do I come to these decisions that keep me sane mentally?

Thank you","Is it just me, or did this year put a substantial dent in your FIRE endeavor?",1672020258

472,financialindependence,"Hey all,

I'm attempting to do a backdoor roth ira. Despite all the info available on this, I can't find any on my specific situation, and I'm hoping folks here can help (standard disclaimer: I'll consult a tax pro as well).

My situation:

* I make too much in income to contribute to a Roth IRA
* I accidentally contributed to my Roth IRA, *however*, I never invested the money. It's just sitting as cash in my brokerage Roth IRA account

Here's my understanding of how I can fix this

* Transfer the money out of the Roth IRA to my bank account. I'd take out exactly what I contributed. Since it's just sitting there as cash, I don't need to sell any positions
* Transfer the money into a Traditional IRA with the same brokerage
* Immediately convert that Traditional IRA into my existing Roth IRA (which already has money in it)
* Because I'm transfer the principle contribution which was already pre-tax money ($6k), and because it never had any gains (it was just sitting there as cash ‚Äî at best it has whatever marginal interest is gained in the cash account), I won't owe any taxes (taxes would just be on any gains)

Questions

* Is the above correct? This feels weird ‚Äî¬†I'm basically just transferring money from account to account in my brokerage
* Should I do anything different? In theory I could maybe recharacterize my contribution to the Roth IRA, but that seems complex and time-consuming (idk much about recharacterization). Am I right to stick with the above instead?",Backdoor Roth IRA Question (mistakenly already contributed),1671909817
473,financialindependence,"I have seen enough websites and youtube videos explaining how money works. I know that working a job, and saving, is not gonna make you rich. I know that trading my time for money is very limiting and that it isnt the only way to make money. I know I need to invest my money and knowledge and time, all 3 of them, into making more money. I know that making my first million once I'm 80 years old is pointless. So my goal is to make alot of money fast.

But the problem with all these online sources of information is mostly this: they tell me great philosophies about money, but they don't give me an actual guide that lets me jump from thoughts into action. They tell me what to do, but not how exactly to do it. For example, when someone says you have to invest money to make more money out of it. Thats good to know but then I still don't know HOW to invest money and make more money out of it. What do I invest my money on? Stocks? Start my own business? I know there are many options, but that exactly is the problem, there are too many options and I can't afford investing so much time in studying everything. I would be 30 and still studying everything and still be poor because I didnt take action.

So what are some good sources of information that can actually guide me through action? And by that I mean advice, not like ""invest money and knowledge to make money"", but rather like ""make an account on X website, buy these stocks, etc.."" because even after so much money philosophy, I believe I have an idea of how money works in this world, but I'm still completely clueless on how to do it myself.

I am considering buying a low-cost home and renting it to her sometime in the next couple of years as her options could run out for housing. She's currently roommates with a friend and that situation is not guaranteed long-term. 

I would buy something low-cost enough that if she had a health problem and could make rent easily, it would be not a big deal at all for me to cover it. Like 600/month. My income is 215k and my current mortgage is $1500 a month, so it's pretty feasible. There are communities close enough to us selling homes for 60k-100k for seniors. 

Questions:

\- Can I buy a 55+ community if I am not 55+. She is 55. 

\- Assuming it's a manufactured home, how much risk am I taking on? How much should I beef up my emergency fund? Obviously, I'd get it thoroughly inspected.

The video ‚ÄúThe 2.7% Rule for Retirement Spending‚Äù

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FwgCRIS0Wg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FwgCRIS0Wg)

brings in multiple arguments on why the US equity market has done so much better and Ben builds up the discussion around the newer paper study on ‚ÄúThe Safe Withdrawal Rate: Evidence from a Broad Sample of Developed Markets‚Äú

&amp;#x200B;

My takeaway is that the content and arguments made are well researched. Just dismissing the arguments for considering a lower rate as the new norm if one wants to be within the 100% success rate carries risks. I know setting the SWR is a personal choice. I do agree that fixed rate is not the best method as well and will personally target a variable withdrawal rate, but have not set my final goal yet.   
What I found valuable and good confirmation is the spilt of equity/bonds 60/40 to hold up as well as being more internationally exposed when it comes to investment distribution.

512,financialindependence,"Hi, some of you might remember my [original Reddit post with the Simple FIRE Tracker v1](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/spm9lo/simple_fire_tracker/) I shared with you about a year ago. I spent some time updating the tracker based on your valuable feedback (see the link below). Thank you for your feedback, and please keep it coming.

**Here are the included updates:**

* Exposed in editable cells some key values you wanted to change often (column S). Previously those values were embedded in formulas and difficult to find. Now there is no need to edit formulas anymore.
* Included checkboxes beside every account to allow declaring selected accounts as tax-free. This way any selected account tax values would not negatively impact the final calculation.
* The more accurate calculation for the ""Monthly net income... (Inflation adjusted)"". The inflation is now applied on a monthly level instead annually. 
* Improved formulas
* Improved visuals

My goal is still the same, to create the simplest possible spreadsheet so everyone can use it to get the results quickly. There are many amazing advanced spreadsheets, but I wanted to go in a different direction and make a spreadsheet that anyone can populate in about 30 minutes, once a year, and visualize their progress.

**Get the Simple FIRE Tracker v2.0 here:**

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eaM-o1JNnEn7j4834\_suRbpWd1KTZHgmBv0rJuhODwk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eaM-o1JNnEn7j4834_suRbpWd1KTZHgmBv0rJuhODwk/edit?usp=sharing)

To start editing values go to **File &gt; Save a Copy** and this would save the spreadsheet into your personal Google Drive. Make sure you are logged into your Google account first. Otherwise, this option will be grayed out.

**Description**

There are two components on the main tab:

1. **The FIRE Playground** allows you to test various strategies. Add your data into the grey fields and see how realistic your FIRE plan is. Change your FIRE year, investment values, contributions, average inflation, etc... All grey fields are meant to be editable.   
It is interesting to play with numbers. For example, imagine you sell your property and include all the money as an investment while lowering your monthly contribution as you would now have to rent. The final numbers will show your investment value at the desired FIRE year, how much money you will be able to take every month, and even how much money would that be in ""today's money"" so you can better understand if that would be enough to live comfortably in retirement.
2. **The Actual vs Benchmark Performance** chart is independent of ""The FIRE Playground"" block. The numbers for this chart are coming from the ""Periodical Account Values"" tab. Go there and add your numbers and delete what you don't need.   
In this example, Alex and Sasha have different investments, starting at different times. In the rightmost column is the benchmark value (\~$1.5M in 2032). This is the amount they believe will be enough for them to FIRE in 2032. The final result is the graph chart showing where Alex and Sasha are currently on their journey. They are catching up with the benchmark!

Please keep in mind, this is not an advanced tool. It is created to be simple to use while still providing valuable information. I open all my investment accounts on January 1st and add all the values into this tracker.",Simple FIRE Tracker v2.0,1671769745

My entire life, I have dreamt of being ""free.""
My understanding of that dream was location independence, simply being able to be and work from whenever I choose.

I'd spend my days at boarding school fantasising, excited for the future. I was never very popular at school, due to social anxiety and being chubby.

I'm not chubby anymore, but I'm still building up my body.


At the age of 17, 
I decided I'd finally try and take the life I wanted. I thought I was miserable. I didn't yet understand what that word means. I experience the worst depression of my life recently. Endless existentialism.


To try and "" make it"" I attempted everything you could imagine. All the gimmicky shit that ""gurus"" tell you at first, slowly progressing into more legimate attempts. I took on little side gigs to finance my ability to try and fail. All part of learning what the real world truly requires for success.


I did this for four years. Four years of failure.

Recently, it finally paid off.
Within the last week I went from getting a few sporadic odd jobs, less than 3,000 a year, to making 84,000 per year. 

Not a millionaire or anything, but I'm doing well.

That's of course an achievement I should feel proud of, and on some level I do. But I didn't leap up and down when I found out the news. Frankly, I found my own response incredibly underwhelming.



I feel hollow. I have money now, but no idea what I'll even do with it, other than continue to work and try create something greater, that can make more money.


My friends are all in South Africa.
My parents live in Oman.
My brother lives in Japan.
And my girlfriend and I are in Germany, heck I still need to finish university here.


I have no idea what to do with my life, so that I can be genuinely happy. I have a cat, I don't think I could make it past each lonely week without her.

I still live in relative isolation. I haven't found it easy to mske friends here.


I missed out on the university experience as everything went fully online due to corona, right before I started university.
That hurt, as somebody who made it through a lonely high-school experience by telling myself everything would be different in university.


I'm not really sure what the point of this post is. I'm just letting my thoughts spill out.

530,financialindependence,"**Backstory**

Early 40s, single no children located in southern CA. I co-founded a tech company that was acquired early 2021, my background is in software engineering.  I had to stay on board after the acquisition for a bit, but it netted me enough to reach my FIRE number(4M).  Mid 2022 I quit my job at the new company.  I was completely burned out.

I had a Vanguard 401K account for around 15 years, but it was something I just consistently put money in and never checked the balance.  So I consider myself an investing beginner.  

I signed up for Vanguard personal advisor services to help with the initial investing strategy.  They set up a conservative 60/40 portfolio.  The plan was to start the portfolio with a lump sum then dollar cost average until I was fully invested‚Ä¶  Then the market dropped and I reduced my monthly investments because I got spooked.  Didn‚Äôt pull anything out, just reduced monthly contributions.

**Current Setup**

I‚Äôve got \~20% invested in the stock market and the rest invested in t-bills and high yield savings accounts returning around 4%, enough to live on at the moment.  

**Thoughts**

Reaching FIRE does not mean you‚Äôll be worry free.  When I didn‚Äôt have any money I wasn‚Äôt really concerned about world events‚Ä¶ Now every mention of recession or inflation stresses me out.  I‚Äôve always had problems with anxiety so this might just be me, but seriously the news is so toxic.

Find something to be excited about before FIREing!  I‚Äôve started a new project but it‚Äôs really not as exciting as I‚Äôd like. Make sure you have something passionate to work on.  I‚Äôm still searching for that. 

Flexibility and free time is amazing!  

**Next Steps**

I need to decide if I should up my monthly investments or continue to keep living off t-bills\\interest.  It seems like that first year of FIRE is critical so it‚Äôs got me nervous about getting fully invested in the stock market and starting to withdraw from it.

I found this sub around the time I started working.  At the time, I had already been tracking my expenses for a few years through school, so I projected that I would be able to retire by age 40.  This was before I moved to Silicon Valley, got a spouse, got a house, and had 2 kids of course.

*Why not just post in the daily thread*?

**Expenses**

Current expenses are $8,400/mo, broken down as:

* Mortgage (PITI): $3,100/mo
* Childcare: $2,800/mo
* Utilities: $200/mo
* Misc. shared expenses (travel, insurance, groceries, etc.): $1,000/mo
* Black hole of personal expenses: $1,300/mo

Mortgage, utilities, and shared expenses ($4,300/mo) is just the cost of a family of 4 and I think they're fantastic for the Bay Area.  The only vacations we take are to visit family, for example.  The mortgage is for a 3 bedroom house.

Childcare will drop off within the next five years, but we're actually looking at hiring part time help for the weekends, so this number will only go up in the short term.  I have mentioned elsewhere that I literally have to do basic tasks, like mow the lawn, at night after the kids go to bed because they're so difficult

The ""black hole"" category is a bit of a cop-out, and I imagine there's stuff to cut there.  I do eat out a lot for work, to the tune of $500/mo.  Most of the rest is medical expenses (Lasik in one eye, a few $200 doctor visits became &gt;$500 trips to urgent care thanks to Covid cautiousness by doctors)


**Thoughts**

* After 15 years, I have &lt;10 years of expenses saved up (excluding home equity).  This is while making what I consider a high income (average ~$160k in 2022 money).  This is discouraging and honestly makes me doubt the viability of FIRE for the vast majority of families because our ""fixed"" costs are so high.  I am definitely much more pessimistic on FIRE as a movement this year
* My house was a horrible investment.  According to Redfin, my share of the house has appreciated exactly with inflation (20%, or ~150k) since I bought it.  However, I also spent &gt;$200k renovating and expanding it.  That money is, as of today, completely gone
* Speaking of horrible investments, 2018-2022 I traded a few tech stocks (AMD -&gt; TSLA -&gt; NET -&gt; RKLB).  I gained 10X on the first 3 over three years, then lost 75% on the last one in one quarter.

572,financialindependence,"Hey, 

I just realized, that if human life span increased by just 20-25 years, rich people would essentially be ultra rich. Sounds cryptic, but let me break it down. 

By increasing the life span, I mean that a 48 year old would feel like a 28 year old and so on. 

Lets say that if you put in 3000$ a month into investments, and began so at 23 years old. You compounded them at 12.2% per year (more or less safe returns) by putting your money into blue chip stocks. At 12.2% returns, your money doubles every 6 years. 

Here is the math -&gt;

[https://www.calculator.net/annuity-calculator.html?cstartingprinciple=0&amp;cannualaddition=0&amp;cmonthlyaddition=3000&amp;cadditionat1=beginning&amp;cinterestrate=12.2&amp;cyears=60&amp;printit=0&amp;x=74&amp;y=11#annuity-result](https://www.calculator.net/annuity-calculator.html?cstartingprinciple=0&amp;cannualaddition=0&amp;cmonthlyaddition=3000&amp;cadditionat1=beginning&amp;cinterestrate=12.2&amp;cyears=60&amp;printit=0&amp;x=74&amp;y=11#annuity-result) 

23, net worth a 0$

at 33, its 680,000$

at 43, its 2.8 million$

at 53, its 9.6 million$

at 63, its 31 million$

at 73, its 99 million$

at 83, its 313 million$. 

As you can see, the REAL effects of compounding in this scenario come into life after 30 years of investing (at the age of 53). From 23 to 53, the wealth rises by around 9-10 million$. But from 53 to 83,  it rises by a whopping 300 million$. 

By the time you get to see the real effects of compounding, you're already old and frail. 

If human beings aged slowed by about 20-30 years, you'd see that a lot more people would be ultra rich, and would actually enjoy their money since they'd not be so old. 

The only way I make sense of this is that even though I'm  really old by the time the compounding magic comes to life, atleast my children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy the fruits if my labour.

My income is high enough to live a comfortable life but I want more. So I brainstormed the last weeks what I could to make more money. I already started investing in crypto two years ago but this is just a sidenote. I also go to seminars to broaden my knowledge and professionalism in terms of social work.

I thought that it should be a job that could do remote from PC as I have a dynamic worktime. I also have time while on nightshifts which I want to use. Maybe I could work doing commissions.

My ideas: Programmer, Webdesigner or 3D-Moddeling-Artist.

1. I have Almost zero experience in programing but I'm pretty smart, a fast learner when interested and I am good with computers.
2. I was in a design/artist highschool and have experience in design and using most Adobe Softwares.
3. I also have experience in 3D-Moddeling using blender as it was kind of a hobby earlier in Life.

So my questions for you:

1. Which way seems more likely to achieve a secondary Income with?
2. Which path is the fastes to learn respectivly to professionalize?
3. Which profession is paid better after becoming a fulltime professional?
4. In context with what I told you what would you advise me overall and mybe apart from my own suggestions?

581,financialindependence," My wife and I are in our early 30s.  I‚Äôve had a long-time love of technology and work at a large tech firm.  I‚Äôve been in tech for about 15 years and have always loved it.  I don‚Äôt think I ever want to RE, but we‚Äôll see.  

I love my job.  I‚Äôd be working on some open-source project if I wasn't getting paid.  I make stupid good money and never want to stop.  I get to play with the latest and greatest tech, I have minimal meetings, and my work is super flexible.  If it's a good powder day or I want to go for a 3-hour mountain bike ride I can generally skip out on work without much issue.  When I do take long stretches off work, I enjoy ramping up some of my other hobbies, but I yearn for the engineering work.

My wife and I live on the west coast to enjoy our outdoor hobbies more and with our very excessive spending we live on about $80,000 a year.  This 80K a year covers our $2600 mortgage, all bills, and us basically endulging in all the food / hobbies we want. This puts our FI number at 2 million.  We have 1.5 million invested and 30% paid.  The reality seems like we will hit FI in no time, and likely keep generating income from our fields of work which we love.  My wife has already reduced her hours and I could always consult part time if something happened where my work-life balance didn‚Äôt rock.

So, once we hit FI I plan to expand our spending, because what else would I do with the money?  I want to move my parents out west to be closer with us, maybe have nicer mountain bikes, stay in nicer hotels when we go skiing, increase our charity donations, etc. Why not?

We are likely to be a 250K + household for the foreseeable future, and we‚Äôre going to have money way past our FI number‚Ä¶ Any thoughts on how to use that to improve life?",What to do with extra money after FI number is met,1671606913

So I have two credit cards that together I have $3300 I owe. My issue is that both of these cards have high interests and it's what preventing me to pay them off quick .

Little context, neither I nor her know jack shit about advanced finances or mortgage aside from the basic info.

But I did notice she has 733 for a credit score which is beautiful for a 21 year old, and if I had to guess her yearly income it'd be about 50k a year on the light side, more likely around 65.

But anyway the question I wanna ask is; is it a good idea to look into getting a mortgage now while her credit score is highest? I know being under 25 is probably a demerit, but if that's all I don't see why not. Unless active years is a deal breaker, then I'd get it...

615,financialindependence," 

I've heard in the past that it's not smart to borrow money or take out a loan and invest it into the Stock Market.

In the past I would take out $10,000-$20,000 loans that ran for \~5 years at an interest rate anywhere from 7%-9%.

Yes I know that ultimately I shouldn't be doing that. Fortunately I got really lucky and placed them into very good blue chip companies before deciding to just withdraw it all and then just dump everything into an S&amp;P500 index fund.

There is another interesting thing about this strategy that I wanted to point out. That even though the interest rates were high at 7%-9%, and the loans were for about 5 years, I would pay them all off within less than a year like anywhere from 6months-8months. So I didn't have to pay much interest on the loan due to paying it off so quickly. My goal was to simply take a large lump sum and quickly put it all into the market. Basically ""time in the market"" &gt;&gt;&gt; all else. It would have taken me considerably longer to wait to accumulate $20,000 with my bi-weekly pay checks.

628,financialindependence,"I started on my FIRE journey back in the 2010s when I graduated law school.  $200k in student loan debt, soul-crushing job, no way out.  FIRE was really what helped me feel more in control of my life.  I started a side hustle e-commerce business and started riding my bike everywhere.  Eventually I felt secure enough to leave my first job and switch to a better job, even though it was a paycut.

Between 2018-2021, I kept the better job and started carefully building a more purposeful life.  I bought some cheap land and built an affordable home that I love.  The lack of financial and career stress has allowed me to be more social, so I feel like I have a more well-rounded life too.

So, to the point.  In late 2021 a friend of mine (someone I met due to my nicer job!) approached me and asked if I'd be interested in joining her personal injury law firm.  I was skeptical b/c it feels a bit scummy to be a personal injury attorney, it just has a stigma.  But my friend explained that if I came on board I'd get a % of every case I win.  That cuts both ways; if I don't win, I don't make any money.

I figured why not give it a try?  I have a ton of savings, so if it didn't work out I could just go get a normal job again.

Well, after a year of this job, it looks like I'll have made about $350k in 2022, and I am working remotely.  It's an awesome job.  Before this, the most I've ever made in a year is $110k.  This is an astounding amount of money to me, and I could possibly barista FIRE now if I wanted to.  I would never have taken this job if not for the position FIRE put me in.

652,financialindependence,"Recently my wife and I became mortgage free, it felt absolutely amazing making that final payment and a goal achieved after about 7 years. We've never taken out a normal loan so never had debts outside the mortgage  

On personal level, I worked hard to make it happen and in hindsight there were many hard days at work but this goal in the distance kept me going.

We both agreed not to tell anyone, not even family. I'd personally would love to tell my dad though as he hasn't been well and I feel he would be proud. 

And finally, oddly I have a strange feeling - I've had a very bad week at work and have a voice in my head saying ""run away - travel abroad"" and rent the paid off house. I would get more than enough to live a decent life. 

If I use my intelligence, it says stay in my high stress job and keep saving, invest in more property or stocks. I won't rush into anything but in an odd way achieving the dream has made me lose focus in the past couple of weeks. 

But anyways, feels good to confess what I've been unable to tell anyone in real life

653,financialindependence,"This was my first year making enough money that using a backdoor IRA was worth it. Due to a combination of other factors and my propensity to procrastinate, I didn't realize this until very near the tax deadline. I hastily read up on backdoor IRAs and did what I thought was correct, but I clearly didn't do enough research. Anyway, not here to make excuses, just trying to figure out what I should do now.

The situation:

1. I had a traditional IRA with ~$8k in it. In April 2022, I made an after-tax contribution of $6k for tax year 2021. I know this opens me up to the pro-rata rule, though it's a pretty small balance I'd have to pay taxes on.
1. The bigger mistake was that I put the money in VTSAX. Also, VTSAX has not done well since April, so I have a decent chunk of losses.

Options I think I have:

1. Convert everything to a Roth IRA. My understanding is I'd have to pay income tax on the portion of the Traditional IRA that was contributed pre-tax. That shouldn't be a huge tax bill and this is probably the easiest thing to do.
1. I think my employer allows rolling my IRA into a 401k. If I understand correctly, I could rollover only my pre-tax portion to a 401k, then convert the post-tax portion to a Roth IRA. I've been reading [White Coat Investor's](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/backdoor-roth-ira-tutorial/) article to try to understand this better.

In either case, I'll have a loss on the money that I contributed post-tax. My understanding is that's just going to complicate my paperwork come tax time next year, but other than that there's not much to be done about it.

Mainly looking for confirmation that I do / don't understand this correctly and advice on which of the paths I should try to take at this point. And yes, I'll be more careful going forward. Thanks!","Made mistakes with my backdoor IRA, trying to determine best path forward",1671220484

667,financialindependence,"Help me if you can and show me the right direction for Financial Independence.

I am 45, married with two kids 5 and 8 and primarily single income household with wife just starting a new job at $40k. We live in a HCOL area. I work for as a Program Manager in a large Pharma company. Base comp is $196k. Short and long term comp add to another $100k. I have been with them for about 3 years with first stock option given at end of year 1. Every stock option has a 3 year vesting period. 

At this time total stock I have been given is $116k split as $53k vesting in Jan 2024 and $63k vesting in Jan 2025. I expect an additional $53k stock grant in Jan  2023 and vesting in Jan 2026 (not included in above $116k). The total of my retirement savings (401k, IRA etc) add up to about $1M. 529k balance is about $101k. Outside of this I have a 6 month emergency fund and use YNAB which shows I am 4 months ahead on a monthly budget. My house is fully paid off and worth $750k.

The company is doing a large scale reorganizing and 85 pct of the IT jobs are being cut and the reason for reorg is the consolidation of two business lines and business layoff impact is 50pct. I have been notified that my job is being eliminated with expected impact date in H2 2023. The earliest this will occur is Oct 2023 and could be as late as Jan 2024. The company will give me a 90 day hard notification (what was communicated is a soft notification) before this occurs. If I wait for the severance I get about $220k split as follows assuming impact date is Oct 2023.

1. Prorated short term compensation (bonus for 2026). Assuming 30pct bonus, this would be $58k prorated to $48k as of the month of separation


2. Prorated long term compensation out of all the stock awards above which would add up to $97k because of the following:

Jan 20 2024 vesting ($53k) prorated = $48k

Jan 20 2025 vesting ($63k) prorated = $35k

Jan 20 2026 vesting ($53k) prorated = $14k

3. 20 weeks severance pay which would equal $75k

I am thinking of relaxing for the rest of 2022 and put in place plans starting in 2023. I am looking for advise on whether I should wait for the severance, collect the package and then look for another job or start asap and start looking for a job in 2023 and forego the above or perhaps get lucky enough finding an employer who would atleast take on the long term comp that I will leave on the table. An additional challenge I am running into is I am unable to find similar paying jobs anymore. I don't know if my age is against me. If I don't find similar paying jobs could I take a lower paid job especially given that I don't have a lot of expenses except saving more for retirement and kids college expenses?

My previous post was deleted because it wasn‚Äôt sufficiently related to FI or RE and it absolutely is. So hopefully the moderators review it again and I can get the feedback I am seeing from fellow enthusiasts. 

I have been working on becoming FI. I started too late and now I can‚Äôt help but feel insecure about my financial progress

I am not sure what I am looking for here. Some reassurances? Someone to say I‚Äôm doing ok? All I know is this is seriously stressful to the point where I can‚Äôt seem to enjoy life now because I keep preparing for the life tomorrow and I am far from certain I‚Äôm doing enough. 

Some of the responses have been that I have too much money or too much household income to seriously complain but I don‚Äôt believe any of these preclude me from having issues that I am seeing feedback on. If my money offends you, please skip to the next post. We are both first generation immigrants and started in the US with nothing and no social or family safety nets. 

I am 42, my wife is 44. My wife is a registered nurse who will make about $200k this year. Between investments, my business income and an STR property we own and I run I‚Äôll make about $200k this year as well for a total HHI of $400k. 

We own a primary residence and an investment property that we STR. 

Our net worth is about $1.5m which includes equity in the properties, about $600k in cash and liquid investments and about $210k in retirement savings. We max out my wife‚Äôs 401k and I have a small IRA but generally I am unable to take advantage of IRAs due to income and I don‚Äôt have nor can I get a 401k (hard to explain but this is the case). 

We started accumulating capital very late but our current expenses are very low and we‚Äôve been saving and partially investing 100-150k or more in cash every year for a few years. 

Problem is while my wife‚Äôs income is stable (although depends on some overtime) mine is unpredictable and I fear that my business will not survive next year. The plan is to exit with a $300k or so before tax and wind down operations. Kinda sad since this business took 10 years of my life, profitable 10 years but still. 

It would bring my net worth up to $1.8m or so with almost a million in cash or liquid investments. So there‚Äôs some room to play around. 

I have no current plan beyond that, maybe acquire a few more STR properties as they‚Äôre profitable. 

I feel like I have to have more going on at this stage of life. I feel like I should be more secure in what I‚Äôm going to be doing next. 

I also want to enjoy my life now. Instead I feel my life shrinking and me getting smaller emotionally. I can‚Äôt bring myself to spend because I am uncertain in what tomorrow is going to bring.

746,financialindependence,"My husband (33M) and I (also 33M) started really contributing to our retirement accounts hardcore around 2017-2018, so all we've seen is the rapid rise of our accounts from around $60K (I didn't start keeping track of growth before then) to around $410K last December, in 2021.

Then the correction started. And we've continued to max out our 401Ks like we've been doing for the past several years, along with some other contributions to taxable accounts and the like.

All in all, in 2022, we've contributed about $50K to our retirement accounts.

Yet, despite that, our account balances are nearly exactly where they were 1 year ago today.

I love that we've been able to ""hold the line"" as it were, and I know that ""stocks are on sale"" so this is a good thing as far as our long term balances are concerned.

But I also am super excited to see what that discounted ""50K"" bought us in terms of non-depressed value. I.e. when the correction is over, what are our accounts going to balloon to?

(Sidenote: Is there any good calculators out there to visualize that?)

Anywho, I know this is obvious to most of us, but this is the first time in my investing-life that we've encountered a bear market. Provided my husband and I can keep our high-paying jobs throughout it (and don't worry, we have a 1 year emergency fund if we were to lose one or both), we're excited to see what comes of the diligence to keep investing and not panic-selling like the average consumer.

748,financialindependence,"Hi,

A few years ago, I learned that the order should be as follow:

1. Max HSA first
2. Max roth IRA next
3. Max roth 401K (employee) next
4. Max mega backdoor roth next
5. Max roth 401K (employer) last

For example, the 2022 max contribution limit for a single individual under 50 yo is $61000. To maximize roth contribution, one should contribute as follow:

1. $3650 to HSA (max allowed $3650)
2. $6000 to roth IRA (max allowed $6000)
3. $20500 to roth 401K employee side (max allowed $20500)
4. $34500 mega backdoor roth (max allowed $40500)
5. $0 to roth 401K employer side because the #2 + #3 + #4 above already reaches $61000 limit.

Is my example above correct? Please share your thoughts.

By the way, this is for self employed people who control their 401K plan and the level of contribution on both employee and employer sides.","What's the ""proper"" priority when it comes to funding various retirement accounts?",1670941934

Surely there's a middle ground, where you're paying a fair price for a decent quality that looks good, fits well, and lasts several years.

Same amount of money in my accounts than I had at the end of 2021.  
I own no assets that could bring me additional income or free up time.

I feel like I've focused on the wrong stuff this year and, as a consequence, made no progress towards my goal of become FI.

Two years ago I escaped the 9-5 rat race and become a freelancer.

The first year was the year of famine: tough to find clients, under paid, hard to make enough to live.

Second year things improved: too much work, higher rates, still hard to make enough due to 50% extorted in taxes + costs

With year 2 of freelancing came the realizations that in order to stay afloat, there are no weekends, no vacations, if I'm sick, it won't matter, I have to work anyway.

I realized how, in fact, I've just changed prison, not earned my freedom.

Maybe I shouldn't complain too much. I work way less than a 9-5, make more, live abroad and can setup my schedule as I desire.

But still... it's not enough. 

I want to spend my time working for myself, not for others. It hurts deeply inside keep spending precious lifetime  doing stuff for other people, rather than living my days in excitement building stuff I enjoy.

Reading Naval Ravikant was enlightening, as I understood that I need to build and own assets in order to really achieve financial freedom (and wealth).

2023 goal is not to make more, but to make the same through assets.

I want to build stuff that makes me money long-term.

It's risky, but I've decided to call off all the freelancing partnerships I've built this year, stop freelancing and try to build some income stream in the 3-4 months of runaway I gathered.",Freelancing is another type of Rat Race ‚Äî Seeking FI in 2023,1670921183

771,financialindependence,"I am young and currently a 1099 contractor with very little money in my Traditional IRA ($7500, with $4400 of it contributed this year in 2022, as a 1099) and am thinking about converting all of it to Roth. 

My question is on the taxes side. For the sake of an example, assume I receive a 1099 form before April's tax season that shows I made $80K (total) for 2022. If I convert all $7500 to a Roth IRA, do I pay taxes on the $80K PLUS the entire $7500 that was converted from Traditional to Roth? Or do I only pay taxes on the $80K PLUS ($7500 - $4400) because I haven't actually formally deducted the $4400 from my taxable income yet in 2022? I would assume it's the latter, because otherwise I get double taxed for the $4400 amount, but assumptions are bad because tax laws can be weird.

For context, I had previously worked W-2 with an employer that offered a 401K, and when I left that company (to be a contractor), without knowing anything about retirement accounts, I converted it to a traditional IRA. Now that I am educating myself, I realize a Roth 401K probably makes more sense in my specific situation.

772,financialindependence,"About a year ago I made a post about my goals in 2022. In this post I am reflecting on how that went, and thinking about what goals to set for 2023.

My 2022 goals:

* I'm working fewer hours and only on things I *have* to do. I'm trying to avoid taking on new projects and responsibilities
   * *Nailed this one.*
* Am training others so people don't feel lost when I leave in the fall/winter
   * *50% complete. Have not left yet, that is happening soon.* 
* Am cleaning up my investments, budgeting etc. so financially I'm comfortable with the plan
   * *I consolidated investments and accounts. TLH complete. We created a budget! Am comfortable with my plan, even though the markets are down this year. We have enough cushion in the swr to weather typical downturns and SORR.*
* Talking to my spouse a lot about it. She is amazing and totally supportive. Kids are too young to understand anything right now!
   * *Ongoing, and she* ***is*** *amazing.*
* I'm trying hard to think of what I'm going to spend time on next. This is the hardest part. Right now the leading idea is to give myself a break of 6 months to a year after I retire, where I don't take on anything where I exchange time for money. After that I am most likely to mess around with a startup idea that doesn't require massive amounts of time or $ investment. Or maybe I'll be fine with not doing anything for money, *ever*. I'm in my very early 40s, so the idea of being done for good is scary.
   * *Also an ongoing conversation with myself and family. I don't have a clear idea of what I want to retire to. I feel like a freshman not knowing what to major in. One day I want to be a writer, another I want to develop a startup. I'm trying to let it come to me organically, but darn it is taking time!*
* For the moment just focusing on physical and mental health. Almost 20 years of unhealthy grinding has definitely taken its toll, and it is hard work to detox.
   * *Achievement unlocked! After a long time I have truly focused on my well-being, and proud of myself for having put in the hard work this year.*

For 2023, I have a shorter list of goals:

* Travel more
   * Thinking 2+ times, at least one international
* Be more ""present""
   * I've always planned for the future, for security. Going to push myself to be more in the present and rediscover my goofy self
* Retire from current career, and reinvent myself
   * Reinvent how? I dunno. Any ideas?

807,financialindependence,"I'm a 29-year-old entrepreneur living in Canada.  I've worked my tail off to build a business over the last 5 years and have accumulated $250,000 in a corporate account.  Ever since the account hit 100k, I haven't done anything to re-invest the money.  The business I'm running doesn't require huge upfront fees or heavy expenses that would require me to have a lot of cash on hand.  I've gone back and forth many times about what I want to do with the money.  Real Estate was what I was going to initially invest in, however, the recent interest rate hikes have me rethinking that idea.

I'm leaning towards GIC's as the rates are currently pretty good.

808,financialindependence,"**tl;dr:**  A baseline SWR of &lt;=3%, using the 3-4% range as headroom for unexpected or one-off expenses, seems like a good way to manage uncertainty about both expenses and investment returns without being excessively conservative.  Do others do similar things?

**Long Version:**  FI budgeting is difficult due to dealing with uncertainty about *both* investment returns *and* expenses.  No matter how carefully one budgets, there will occasionally be large unexpected or one-off expenses that aren't reflected in a ""typical"" annual budget.  Unexpected expenses are ""stuff happens"" things like large out-of-pocket medical or legal bills, not things like normal home maintenance and repair that can be roughly budgeted for even if the specifics aren't known in advance.  One-off expenses are related to major life events even if they're not unexpected.  Think weddings, moving expenses, home remodels, once-in-a-lifetime trips that exceed the normal travel budget, etc.

A 3% SWR basically never fails, at least historically.  A 4% SWR is still fairly-safe even for early retirees, but failure probability goes up drastically if withdrawal rates go even slightly above 4% or if equity valuations are high.  Trying to *always* keep WR below 3% even in high-spending years where unexpected or one-off expenses occur will result in a WR well below 3% in *most* years unless you have a lot of unexpected or one-off expenses.  This is excessively conservative because it assumes near-worst cases for both spending and investment returns, which are independent in a statistical sense.  Choosing a baseline WR closer to 4% leaves little headroom for unexpected or one-off expenses--you'll need to either ramp up your WR to dangerous levels or make painful cuts elsewhere to afford these.

Using a 3% baseline WR for ""normal"" spending and treating the 3-4% range as headroom to deal with unexpected or one-off expenses without cutting elsewhere is a good balance.  It's virtually guaranteed to work unless *both* investment returns *and* expenses end up far towards the ""bad"" end of their distributions, which is far less likely than either alone, and it deals somewhat-explicitly with *expense* uncertainty.",SWR And Spending Uncertainty,1670780626

[Article](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/08/investing-in-an-era-of-higher-interest-rates-and-scarcer-capital) (paywall)

Context: ""One popular approach since the 2010s has blended passive index investing in public markets with active investing in private ones. This saw vast amounts of money flow into private credit, which was worth over $1trn at its peak. Roughly a fifth of the portfolios of American public [pension funds](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/05/can-you-afford-to-retire) were in private equity and property. Private-equity deals made up about 20% of all mergers and acquisitions by value.

One side of the strategy looks vulnerable‚Äîbut not the part that many industry insiders are now inclined to reject. To its critics, index investing is a bust since tech companies loom large in indices, which are weighted by market value. In fact, index investing will not disappear. It is a cheap way for large numbers of investors to achieve the average market return.""","""To its critics, index investing is a bust since tech companies loom large in indices, which are weighted by market value."" - The Economist",1670771385

848,financialindependence,"I am currently saving up for a wedding, a honeymoon (which can wait), an RV (houses are far too expensive nowadays), a caravan, and a 4WD/Jeep/UTE. We'll need to settle for used ones, but that's okay, as long as they do the job. The reason we want two mobile homes instead of just one is because my partner has 2 kids, 14 and 16, so they can keep spending holidays with us if they like (or in case one of us ever needs space for a bit). I'm about to turn 28 and he's 39 - yes, it's a bit of an age gap, but It's not like we're 18 and 30, and we actually have a really good relationship of 5 years. We plan to move back to the USA (Northern Michigan) in the next 5 years, at which point we will sell the vehicles and put deposits on new ones, or possibly a 1-2 bedroom house/apartment. My partner and I have lived with my parents since the pandemic (which is embarrassing considering our ages) and are paying rent. The kids live with their mum and stepdad, he pays child support &amp; splits the school fees with their mum, and I pay for other stuff like clothes/school uniforms and shoes.

We will be setting a wedding date once we have enough money to move out (when we are able to buy at least 1 motor home). I'm hoping to earn the motor home money in 6 months, then have the wedding by November of next year. I also want to be stable enough to have, or perhaps adopt a child by the time I'm 30 (though I/we may still decide not to have any more kids).

My job pays about $40,000 AUD per year, which is not good, and I don't have the kind of skills that get you get a 6-figure job (I am not tech savvy, I dont know anything about mechanics or handy work, I suck at maths and science, and I will never in a million years be socially skilled enough to work in sales or marketing). So I'm really going to need to get smart/creative with this, alongside finding a higher paying job. I have good literacy skills - I'm a high school English Tutor. I also work with a few university students. So I can write a good CV/cover letter. However, my communication/social skills are atrocious (if you've seen The Big Bang Theory, I often get compared to Lucy, Raj's ex-girlfriend), which makes it extremely difficult to get past the interview process. I've taken classes and have worked with a therapist over the years, but I still have a long way to go. It took a year for me to finally land this tutoring job.

My special skills are specifically in the arts (drawing, painting, crafts, and sculpture), which is a horribly difficult industry to get into. I can do very basic web development (HTML and CSS,  but not Javascript), but I'm not qualified. Plus, with Wix, WordPress, and everything else, people don't need web designers that much anymore. I can play piano at about a grade 4 level (for example: Fur Elise, Rondo Alla Turca, The Entertainer,  Moonlight Sonata - except for the 3rd movement), but I'm nowhere near good enough to be any kind of concert pianist. Maybe just sweet background music at an event. I also just started a little partnership with the caf√® at the Mayo clinic in my town, where I sell my gift baskets and chocolate bouquets (it was approved by the caf√® manager, but it may still end up falling through if corporate disapproves). I've been trying to sell portraits and gift baskets online, but soooo many people are doing that right now, and I'm not really getting much business - I will need to speak with someone who specialises in marketing and advertising. But even then, its going to be very hard to earn the amount I need just with that.

I have a bachelor's degree in educational studies, which qualifies me to be a tutor or teaching assistant, but not a teacher. Again, due to my poor speaking skills, I failed my prac assessments, so I just settled for a lesser-degree.

So, what are come smart/creative things I can do to earn that kind of money is a short amount of time? Whether it relates to my current skills or not. Selling the house or our car is not an option. I've tried selling all the furniture we don't need but nobody wants to buy it (though even if they did, that'd get us $5000 at best).

What are some ideas? I know this is a long-shot, and it will be ridiculously hard, but I'm willing to put in the work. I just don't know where to start.","What can I do to earn $200,000 in 2 years?",1670623841

Things I'm changing after making the post.

Maximizing HSA contributions

Adding more to ROTH 401k, as the employer contributions don't count the same way

This should be evident but I'm always looking to improve and make more money at my current job, which seems very underappreciated on my original post at r/investing and I do like my job, and I'm very happy with my life, so please do not ask if I hate my job or my life, they're both great and I'm happy.


Original Post
I want to break down my current position for you and if there's anything I'm missing please ask in the comments.

I'm currently 23, I've saved roughly 35,000 as of now adding all my assets. The past few years I've not saved a ton of money as my jobs didn't pay much, recently I've gotten a job that pays very well compared to any of my past jobs, easily over 60k/year, and will be looking at a 30% raise within the next 5 years as well, on top of this I've applied to a salaried position that may increase my pay even more, if I get the job that is.

Calculations for 2023 limits
Right now my situation is that my employer will match 7% of to my ROTH 401k which depending on how much I make is looking at 5800-8000 contributions from my employer, doing the math on the conservative side leaves me responsible for 323$/week for contributions to meet the limit by EOY. I also save an additional 125$ a week for 2023 ROTH IRA contributions. On top of this I contribute 25$ to my HSA which my employer will match up to 1,000/year of, the HSA is set up to be invested in a growth large cap ETF, as well as my ROTH IRA and 401K in the same growth large cap ETF.

My biggest concern is the excess income I make, a good problem to have I'm sure, but retiring at 40 means I won't preferably be touching my retirement until retirement age, luckily I can still withdraw contributions if I ever need considering it's ROTH. I make around 800-1200$ a week after all deductions, 125$ of this will be going to ROTH IRA. so let's say 675-1075$ left over. I took the average and it was around 1,000, so with all my other bills which I have very few I'm left around 700$/week in free cash flow if you may. I want to put this money to use, as of now I've just been putting the money in an investment account and investing long term, but I spoke to a RFA friend of mine and we got into the situation he suggested Real Estate as a way to leverage myself and diversify, his suggesting was to get an FHA loan on a 1st property, a single family home or duplex, and live there to build equity instead of paying rent, and to invest in a 2nd property as an investment property, and putting the minimum amount down on the FHA property and putting 20% down on the investment property.

I've spent the last year really focusing on my long term financial goals, I'm willing to do whatever this takes, is there any other opinions or any ways I could improve my current outlook? I've spent the past few months learning everything I can about RE investing and focusing on working and saving as much money.

880,financialindependence,"A bit about myself (32 years old)

* finished my PhD a month ago
* Relocated with my fianc√©e to a HCOL area 
* Began my career as a senior scientist ($125k base salary, gross savings rate at 32%)
* Fianc√©e also landed a new job ($115k base)
* No debt (for either of us)
* I hold minimal assets ($4k in my 401K, $6k in my IRA, $5k saved)

&amp;#x200B;

A bit about my goals and situation:

*  FIRE, with an emphasis on RE. The sooner the better, but I don't yet have a target FIRE number or age.
* Rent this year is $47k (our relocation timeline was very aggressive and we kind of screwed up our landing spot. No worries, only signed a 12 month lease).
* Squandering so much of our income on rent has me finally wanting to build equity, so saving up for a house has become a new priority for us. Targeting to buy a house in the $500k-700k range in 1-3 years.

**What i'm struggling with, and the point of this post, is to better understand if the benefits of a higher down payment justify lowering investments in other areas.**

I've charted 4 scenarios below:

&amp;#x200B;

||*Scenario 1*|*Scenario 2*|*Scenario 3*|*Scenario 4*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**401K contributions**|$20,500|$5,625|$41,000|$11,250|
|**IRA contributions** |$6,000|$0|$12,000|$0|
|**Down payment**|$12,000|$32,875|$32,000|$73,750|
|**Purchase date**|Nov 2023|Nov 2023|Nov 2024|Nov 2024|

*(note - I do not receive a bonus in 2023, but I do in 2024, which i've added to the down payment)*

&amp;#x200B;

In scenarios 1 &amp; 2, I buy a house in 1 year and in scenarios 3 &amp; 4, I buy a house in 2 years. The differences between these scenarios boils down to this question: *do I max out my tax-advantaged accounts and put leftover money towards the down payment, or do I lower my investments in tax-advantaged accounts in order to make a bigger down payment*? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my line of thinking: My 401K/IRA should net \~10% ROI. Every extra dollar I put towards the down payment, above the lowest $12k scenario should net \~5-7% ROI, depending on what sort of interest rate I lock in. Also mortgage insurance isn't a factor here because in all 4 scenarios i'm putting down less than 20%.

890,financialindependence,"Hello, 

The great men/women here pursuing this noble cause of FIRE movement are most likely to reach FI by an average age of early-mid 40s i think, but very few are able to cross over the line and bite to bullet of RE.  

Makes me wonder why is that so. When in the holy spirit of FIRE, RE is the main part or the the part where the rubber hits the road (ok, the wheelset hits the rail). Since to be honest, we as Indians/Asians   by nature have always had quite healthy saving rates and are comparatively much more frugal. So FI comes easily or naturally in the process . I dare to believe, our previous generations and many others currently (in so called middle class category) who were/are oblivious to the concept of FIRE, were and are Financial Independent without much effort by mid 40s-50s with simple financial prudence and humble living.  

However, many of us fascinated by the idea of RE and hence drawn to FIRE, settle at either the comfort zone of FI or just just keep moving the goalpost of FIRE target or FIRE corpus or are stuck in one-more year syndrome.  

So, why is it so difficult to retire early? My assumption is that anyone on this sub or on this path is not so motivated by corporate jobs/ rate race culture and wants to own their time, so just FI doesn't help . 

I can think of two evils of human nature , same two driving our dear markets .. FEAR and GREED ..

**FEAR : Train to Busan** 

Fear of unknown black swan events (hyperinflation / war times/ extreme recession/stagflation , terminal diseases wiping out chunk of n/w)  

**GREED :  The Gravy Train** 

 I consider corporate jobs as gravy train, where its so difficult to leave the greed and comfort of monthly paycheck. Its much easier if someone kicks us out of the gravy train (forced FIRE), else our gluttony consumes us and even if we haven't inflated our lifestyles with rising salaries, we still can't leave diving in that pool of gravy and stockpile some more.  

So which train are you riding now. ??

There are few, who have had courage to get off the train and enjoy the destination. Rest of us just keep dreaming what an amazing chapter of life will start when we get down, but in reality we are just on a train to nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I need your advice because I'm a bit desperate and don't know what to do. I tend to think of myself as a bad parent who didn't teach my son financial literacy and independence.

&amp;#x200B;

I did spoil him, but I did give him a helping hand a lot of the time. But I thought I was doing a good thing for him and us.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that my son got this girl pregnant when they were both in college. When that girl's parents found out that she was having sex, they cut her off. Her parents are very religious fruit.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my decision was to help them financially. I found an apartment for them and paid for it. I also paid for the nanny, so they could graduate, find a job and start living for themselves. I even came to babysit my granddaughter on the weekends, so they could focus on their social and personal life.

&amp;#x200B;

But, after graduation, they didn't seem to rush to find a job. They always blamed the pandemic and the financial crises that followed it. So, instead of looking for a job, they announced they were expecting again. I think it was obvious that I was really disappointed by that news.

&amp;#x200B;

I would first cut him off if my son didn't have kids. But now I can't do this because cutting them off would be the same as kicking them out of their apartment and literally making those children suffer. Maybe it's the right step to encourage my son. But I can't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to explain that he needs to think about the future and that I won't be there forever to help them. I asked him to find a job and finally do something with his life. I've been hinting and sending these resources ‚Äî [https://www.doughroller.net/investing/how-to-invest-50k/](https://www.doughroller.net/investing/how-to-invest-50k/) \- so that he can start learning his financial literacy from somewhere else.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I think the least I can do is stop paying for that apartment and ask them to move in with me. I have plenty of space, and we all can fit in. At least the money I'm spending on an apartment, I can invest or put in a savings account for my grandchildren's future.

902,financialindependence,"The 4% rule seems to assume that after thirty years your net worth will be depleted. Many people in the FIRE community seem to have a ""live the life you want and save for it"" mentality, which seems to be a more refined version of YOLO. But basically many seem to agree that you should live your life and die with nothing in order to maximise what the money can do for you while you are alive. However, there seems to be a problem with this idea which is that people tend to live for longer than expected and age care is not cheap. 

I've looked at the lives of many old people and a lot of them seem to end up in overcrowded nursing homes. They have little privacy and the the ratio of nurses to patients is low meaning there is little care. These people generally have run out of money. 

However, I have seen a multimillionaire old man who lives in a self-contained unit in a retirement village. The self-contained unit has a button that he can press that sends a nurse to him on demand. This man has never married and never had kids and basically lived a frugal but comfortable life all his life. He plans to die a multimillionaire and give everything to charity upon death.

If you only have a moderate emergency fund and all your assets are tied up in retirement, you significantly lose out on the flexibility to make radical lifestyle changes.

I personally take the full match for my 401k and 457, but have paused contributing to IRA and have been saving cash and putting it into Ibonds and I might start contributing to my taxable accounts.

I‚Äôm the son of two addicts (with one deceased), who dropped out of high school at 16. I‚Äôve done menial jobs since then and continued to set myself back due to poor decisions and a lack of guidance.

My wife is the daughter of humble beginnings from Mexico whose had her own struggles to work through, too. 

My wife made the gamble of a lifetime by taking the chance on me. I‚Äôm really grateful to her.

And after a few too many set-backs, wanting to be better for my wife and daughter, I decided to grind out a Masters Degree in Teaching (elementary school) to take advantage of an international teaching career. I literally got licensed to teach this November.

With mine and my wife‚Äôs teaching degrees, we decided to move to China, where salaries are high and living expenses are low, in which we now work as teachers for an international school. 

And though I‚Äôm well aware of the criticisms surrounding a move to China, we stepped forward into our new roles fully ready to embrace everything it has in store for us (good and bad). And knowing where I come from, anything is better than that. 

However, it‚Äôs quite honestly a dream package, despite the obvious short coming of living in China post-Covid.

We live on campus and don‚Äôt pay rent. We have meals provided. Open gym. And we receive free tuition for our 8 year old daughter. Our colleagues are awesome, and my school is giving me a lot of amazing opportunities that I wouldn‚Äôt find anywhere else.

In fact, we‚Äôve single handedly managed to save more in our first month‚Äôs salary alone here, than what we‚Äôd previously saved had for an entire year before coming.

Combined, our salary is roughly 130k before tax, without including annual bonuses and extra work offered by the school. 

As it stands, we feel quite confident that we can save roughly 75% of our income during our time here, while still living in relative comfort.

Then two things happened. The first is that I started getting really bored. The typical thing we read here of people lacking purpose now that work has been removed from their life.

Then second, I took too much risk with some of my funds in order to earn extra yield. That company blew up, and now I'm stuck with mounting legal bills and unlikely to get funds back.

# Asset Allocation:

My investing strategy centers around dumping cash into index funds as quickly as I can manage. I was almost all S&amp;P500 initially, but I've since added some additional complexity through factor tilts, geographic diversification, and leverage (via margin debt, levered indices, and futures).

# Asset Allocation Rationale

**Factor Tilts &amp; Geographic Diversification:** 

I have moved my portfolio away from all S&amp;P 500, and instead have bought indices that also capture small, medium, and large-cap equity exposure across US and ex-US developed and developing markets. I have also incorporated factor tilts (value, momentum) in hopes of generating premia. While I hope to capture the historical premia these factors have provided, minimizing risk is my main priority. While the S&amp;P 500 has been a great historical investment, I prefer to diversify across companies of different sizes as well as minimize my geopolitical risk. It's not obvious that growth and US equity will continue to outperform (particularly growth). Also, the historical and potential asset covariance is a plus.

**Leveraged Indices:**

In August of last year, I chose to participate in \[Hedgefundie's Excellent Adventure\]([https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007)) with about 25% of my NW. Needless to say, with equity drawdowns and especially interest rate hikes, I regret this decision. However, I always viewed HFEA as a lottery ticket, and am not too torn up about this current loss.

**Margin Debt:**

I borrow against my current stock (\~1.4x levered) The downsides are margin call risk and the cost of financing debt (currently 5.75%; I'm willing to hold this margin debt with the expectation that equities will outperform). I carefully evaluate historical drawdowns and only hold margin debt amounts that I am comfortable with (more margin means less portfolio drawdown to receive a margin call).

**Futures:**

Currently, I hold one S&amp;P e-mini contract at 2x leverage. I prefer futures over LEAPS options given the lower cost of financing, and the linear returns with the underlying asset (no extrinsic value component). I'll likely get involved in treasury futures for the sake of diversification and generating higher returns.

# Closing

Ultimately, much of my investing involves leverage. I don't believe this is necessarily foolish. Just as 100% stocks while young isn't inappropriate for most, I don't think 110% or even 150% stock exposure is unreasonable for those with the risk tolerance. If you're interested in looking into the subject more, I recommend giving the book \[Lifecycle Investing\]([https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/](https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/)) a read.

My FI number is $5MM, and I hope to reach this by age 45.

928,financialindependence,"I posted about this before but I can't find the old throwaway account I posted it on. If you want an IN DEPTH detail of my last experiences with attracting jealous best friends, DM me and I'll send you the link to the old post, this subreddit does not allow links.

I'm a single 25 year old male and I have this never ending cycle of attracting friends who become bestfriends, but then start competing with me.

Now I've attracted another CLOSE friend who's beginning to compete and become envious of me for the FOURTH time.

The reason why I'm asking for advice again is because the last 3 individuals for the lack of a better word weren't as ambitious or successful as I am. I don't mean that in a cocky way, but to give some context. I make 100k a year, recently moved into a penthouse style apartment, fairly good looking, and I'm always looking to be a positive &amp; inspiring voice for those around me. So I can see how someone who isn't on the same level (again not trying to be cocky) may feel insecure around me. But the close friend in question now is totally different. He's way more successful than me in terms of financials. He makes 300k a year and has multiple streams of income. He also gets more girls than me (not by a huge margin but objectively scores more girls from what I see and what he tells me) and if you've read my old reddit post in the link above you can see why my ability to attract girls has turned my past best friends against me. I mention his accolades because I thought that if I found someone closer to my level or above, has the ability to get girls, there would be no need for them to have jealous or competitive tendencies. But he's starting to show the signs that I've experienced with the last 3 close friends I've had.

Context I believe is important to mention before articulating the jealous/competing signs: We're both single and we both enjoy ""the game"" in talking to girls at the bar, club, and inviting them back to after parties that are hosted at my apartment on the weekends. We go out with 2 of our other boys that we hangout with frequently. We usually have anywhere from 5 to 10 girls back at my place after we go out. So there's enough to go around.

The signs &amp; actions I've observed from him:

1 on 1, the best time in the world. We shoot the shit, talk about business, our next moves to becoming better men, and overall a great, uplifting, motivating, and positive time. Around girls, takes every opportunity to impose or show he's the alpha or leader. For example, tells me to pour him a shot in an overly aggressive ""I have to show these females who's the boss out of us"" type of way instead of asking me. If I'm talking to one of the girls, he finds a way to interrupt me or physically gets in the middle between the girl I'm talking to in a subtle way like leaning over and looking at his phone. At the end of the night when the girls are ready to go home, he'll make it a point that he'll personally walk them all back to their cars and tells me I can stay in my apartment. When we're having a group conversation with girls, we all show respect to whoever is talking by making eye contact and actually LISTENING but when I'm speaking he finds a way to distract whatever girl is next to him to have a side chat that disrupts the flow of the conversation or he'll look down at his phone. He frequently whispers to a girl, points at me and laughs when he thinks I won't notice it. More recently he's made it a point to repeat the same sexual experiences he's had with multiple women within the same conversation that seems like it has the intention to annoy me or see if I'll get jealous. He recently asked a girl if my social media profile gave off ""fake lifestyle"" vibes. The next sign shows what I believe to be a selfish attitude. It was him and I at my place with 5 girls and I called our other 2 boys to join us because they were at the club with us (they just took a separate car) and he told me to tell them that there were only 2 girls so the ""ratio isn't good for more guys."" Mind you, these other 2 friends are solid dudes who would drop everything if you called them for any situation.

We've been close friends for around a year and this has all happened within the last month. Before all the shenanigans, he had no issues interacting with me around girls and respecting me. It was simply I had his best interest, and he had mine and it was genuine. For whatever reason things are starting to shift and I'm at a loss of why.

If anyone can give me insight on why this frequently happens to me, I'd love to hear it. Maybe even dig tough questions at me to see if there's anything I'm doing wrong that I'm not noticing. Any help with this consistent issue I have would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR - I attract friends who become best friends, become jealous of my success with girls, business, careers, education, and engage in behavior to put me down. However the current friend in question is more successful than me in terms of finances and girls.",I attracted another jealous best friend for the 4th time....,1670276004

Are you tired of living paycheck to paycheck and constantly feeling like you're struggling to save money? Well, I've got some tips and tricks that can help you start saving and take control of your finances!

1. Make a budget and stick to it. This might seem obvious, but it's the foundation of good financial management. Figure out how much money you have coming in each month, and then make a plan for how you're going to spend it. Be realistic and don't overspend.
2. Cut back on unnecessary expenses. Take a look at your budget and see if there are any areas where you're spending more than you need to. Are you paying for subscriptions you don't use? Are you eating out too much? Can you switch to a cheaper cell phone plan? Every little bit adds up, so take some time to review your expenses and see where you can save.
3. Save automatically. Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account so you're consistently putting money aside. You can start small and increase the amount over time. The key is to make saving a habit.
4. Look for deals and discounts. Before you make a purchase, check to see if there are any coupons or sales that can help you save money. Sign up for email newsletters from your favorite stores, and follow them on social media to stay up-to-date on the latest deals.
5. Save your windfalls. When you get a bonus at work, a tax refund, or any other unexpected money, put it into savings instead of spending it. This will help you grow your savings quickly.

Follow these tips and you'll be well on your way to saving more money and achieving your financial goals. Happy saving!",My go-to guide to financial independence. Happy saving!,1670273835

939,financialindependence," I have been working in a family business for over three years. I worked in sales prior to that. I have a bachelor's degree in business and I currently work at an investment management firm where my father is the managing member. We look for small and micro cap companies with strong cash flow yields and strong balance sheets. I am trying to market our fund and get it to a greater audience so I travel to talk to other investors and family offices. I had lunch with someone who went to Harvard a few weeks ago and the people I am speaking with and/or working alongside manage millions of dollars. I also work with a group of women who own a marketing firm in New York who have been helping me build our brand and our business.

I am in my mid 20s and I have been able to build up my savings to almost $100k and pay off all debt. We have opportunities to potentially align with another family office to have a bigger platform and work alongside other people as well as manage more money.

943,financialindependence,"This will probably be a little long, but I think there is some good advice for others in here.

I was financially illiterate until about 7 years ago.  I thought living in debt (and substantial debt) was normal because I had a good credit score.  I had gone to expensive schools and was only making 40k a year.  When my wife became pregnant in 2015, I finally started to do financial planning and realized we were not doing well.  Our household net worth was about -$200,000.  

I had a co-worker tell me about Dave Ramsey and I started listening to him and followed some of his principles to start getting out of debt.  I did this for a few years, which did help some but our financial picture changed much more quickly when we discovered FIRE in 2019.  Our household income had gone up significantly (140k) and our net worth was -80k.  We were making progress but that was mostly due to selling cars.  At this point, we decided to get serious with our savings rate by saving over 50% of our income.  I opened a Roth IRA and maxed that and the 401k each year going forward.  In addition, we were paying extra on debt and contributing to a taxable account to use as a bridge account for when we FIRE.  I hated my job at the time, so I had lots of motivation to try to save more and more.  By the middle of 2022, we had a net worth of over 250k.

My wife, was never excited as much as I was with FIRE and wanted to travel and spend some funds but I saw different goals in front of us (coast fire, lean fire, fire, fat fire).  Well, everything came to a head when I was laid off a few months ago.  During that time, we discussed what we were doing and realized that our goals did not fully align.  That being said, we decided that pushing through with a high savings rate until we hit coast fire would be our goal and it would happen in 3-4 years.   
After relocating for a job I was genuinely interested in and had a great team, I was making 10k more.  Everything was back on track, or so I thought.

The problem was I went from a job I hated to this new one that I love.  I now like coming to work and my motivation to pursue FIRE is almost gone.  I think I was doing FIRE for the last few years as I was in a job that I despised.  Starting this month, I dropped our savings rate to \~35% and will now build retirement slowly over the next decades.  With this savings rate, I will likely become financially independent in \~15 years anyway, but it is no longer a race.  This flexibility now gives us more room to travel, eat out, buy clothes and have hobbies.  I did not realize the impact that this would have on our happiness after years of having no flexibility in this area.

**Lessons learned:**

1) If you are miserable at your job, it is not good to suffer through it for years until you can FIRE.  This is even true for higher income jobs.  Look for a new job if you feel this way.

2) If you are married, be on the same page as your spouse and be flexible.

3) While starting young is beneficial, you can start later in life with a large negative net worth and end up turning that around with a high savings rate and being intentional.

4) Do not pursue FIRE without a good reason.  What will you do when you FIRE?

5) For FIRE, do not sacrifice the journey to get to your destination quicker.",Why I am leaving traditional FIRE after 4 years and lessons learned,1670254526
944,financialindependence,"Been saving and investing HARD since I had my first job. I've always thought about how I can own something that takes on a life of its own and pays me passively. I had always thought I could figure out a way to FAT FIRE considering I was very fortunate to have no college debt, a small inheritance from grandparents, and a pretty income. As time goes on my pay is going up but I am sadly still only able to replace 30% of my income from passive sources. No I don't need to live on 100% of my income, by I have a hard and fast rule that if I were to retire my passive investments need to #1 yield enough to not have to sell shares or assets #2 have enough left over to allow for some small amount of reinvestment. 

As things are shaping up it seems like my FIRE journey is looking further and further away and it is starting to get depressing. I've always been a saver, borderline cheap person due to the FIRE dream, but now I am thinking it is time to just enjoy life a bit, buy that XBOX, get that sweet desk I've been looking at, book that vacation, and just accept that a day job is probably going to be my future for at least another 20 years. Anyone else feeling that way? It has been a gut wrenching shift in mentality for me...but I feel like I am starting to turn grey and just can't figure out how to juice what I have for more to get there faster. 

The crazy thing is and this is not to brag...but I feel like I started with a pretty massive advantage over most folks. I started very early on investing, had help with buying some real estate, and have a financially savvy family who encourage and support this journey. Regardless I seem to be missing the mark on how people can do this in their 30's and 40's and have any sort of life. 10K in a 6% yielding stock gets you 50 bucks a month in yield...and that's generally only possible via REITS or something safely. Not to mention taxes so forget actually keeping 50 a month. Safe dividend growth stocks have stupid low yields right now and will take another 30 years to grow to a respectable yield on cost.

I know some people will say dont time the market but i actually can, i wont be able to get it down to the exact day but i can get it down to the month of when i think the market will crash. 

it takes 2 years for a market to recover from a crash on average, if i dont sell, i will lose on that entire 2 years of gains...

for example we know 2023 will be having a crash so up until december 14, there will be a mini rally after jerome announces the 50 bp, i can just sell at the rally and wait for the drop. I know it wont drop 20% in 1 day but the fear will price in gradually base on the daily performance, signaling a sell. It just seems so stupid to me that WE ALL KNOW there will be a recession coming, if not , at the very least  a huge drop in the market in 2023, but there are still ppl advising us to just not "" time the market ""...this would only hurt our portfolio.

To find them, simply type ""escort"" or ""girlfriend experience"" into Instagram's search bar. Once you've found a potential escort, message them to ask them to do something special for you. When messaging them, remember to make your message as complimenting as possible.

Once you've created a secret profile on Instagram, you can search for escorts using specific keywords and phrases. Try searching for ""escort"" in the search bar and you should find numerous profiles matching your criteria. However, it's important to be selective when looking at the profiles - you want to find someone who is experienced and offers high-class service.

You can also look for sex workers on Instagram. Many of them have ads in their bios and are open to sex work.

While the traditional methods of dating and networking for sex work are still in use, Instagram is becoming a popular platform for the sex industry. For example, Jessica Walsh, an entrepreneur in the sex industry, uses the platform to reach men. Before the rise of Instagram, she relied on classified ads, street corners, and phone lines. However, the rise of social media savvy and hashtags are gradually replacing these methods. With the help of Instagram, she grew her business beyond the realm of foot photography.

## **Career Progression** - updates in  **bold**!

Year | Job | Title | Compensation | Notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2011 | Startup A | Internship | $15/hour | Landed an internship through a professor while in college.
2012 | Startup A | Junior Engineer | $60,000 (+92.3%) | Graduated with $70,000 in student loans and stayed at the same company.
2013 | Startup A | Mid-Level Engineer | $70,000 (+16.7%) | Promotion
2014 | Startup A | Mid-Level Engineer | $80,000 (+14.3%) | Performance increase. Also, I bought a house this year.
2015 | Startup A | Engineering Manager | $85,600 (+7.0%) | Moved into a technical management role.
2017 | Startup A | Engineering Manager | $91,000 (+6.3%) | Performance increase
2017 | Startup B | Contract Engineer | $20,000 (-78.0%) | Finished paying off my student loans and needed a break from the grind. Sold all my stuff, rented out my house, and moved to San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua where I contracted for a hospitality startup for 6 months in exchange for some cash, room and board, and food. 
2017 | Startup A | Director of Engineering | $110,000 (+450.0%) | Original company contacted me wanting to start an engineering office in Santiago, Chile. They offered me more money and an inflated title to move down and get it running. I got to live abroad, got more money, and got a fancy new title so I took the job. 
2018 | Startup C | Contract Engineer | $20,000 (-81.8%) | I stuck it out for a year but living in Santiago wasn't for me and the job was too stressful. I departed on a motorcycle trip from Colorado to El Salvador. I contacted a friend I had met as Startup A who had started his own digital marketing company and he contracted me for about 15 hours a week.  
2020 | Corp D | Senior Engineer | $267,000 (+1,235.0%) | After an almost two-year motorcycle trip across in Central America and Southeast Asia, I ended up stranded in Sri Lanka for four months due to Covid. Fear of economic disaster prompted me to look for a new job.
**2021** | **Corp D** | **Senior Engineer** | **$277,681 (+4.0%)** | **Performance increase**
**2022** | **Corp D** | **Senior Engineer** | **$294,341 (+6.0%)** | **Performance increase**
**2023** | **---** | **---** | **$0  (-100.0%)** | **At the end of the month, my girlfriend and I we will both be quitting our jobs and going to Asia for 6 months. For the second half of the year, we plan on traveling the US by by van to find a new place to live!**

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/qBhMYZg.png) is a bar chart of my compensation over time.

Career Progression Takeaways:

- **The Sky is the Limit**: When I was in college, I thought if I could somehow figure out how to make $100k a year, I would be set. And it's true, that's far more money than I need to live. But, around 2017, a friend introduced me to a mobile app called Blind. Blind is a toxic social media application where privileged Silicon Valley tech bros openly and anonymously complain about their overinflated compensation packages. A lot of these guys are making a half a million dollars a year or more. I had an epiphany. The only thing holding me back was myself. I was earning what I thought I was worth and all I had to do was mentally adjust what I thought I was worth. In 2020 I was stuck in Sri Lanka for a few months. I started studying, sourcing referrals from the highest-paying companies, and telling them I wasn't considering any offers under $250k. And it worked.
- **Know What You Live For**: I don't spend a lot of money on stuff but I do spend a lot of money on experiences. Most of those losses come in the form of opportunity costs. Traveling can be pretty cheap but quitting your $300k job for a year means you are not making $300k you could have made. But, experiences and relationships are what drives me. It's hard to get over that mental hurdle but, to me, it's worth it. 
- **Filling the Gap**: In 2017 and 2018 I took ~80% pay decreases so that I could take a break from the grind and do other things. During this time, I sourced contract work. I didn't do that for the $20k. I did it to avoid large gaps in my job history. This upcoming trip, I'm not doing that because my job has offered to take me back when I return and I don't love working on the road. My point is, if you do this, just make sure you are employable afterwards. 
- **Set a Date**: Wether you are switching jobs or taking a sabbatical, set a date and stick to it. I stayed at the first job far longer than I should have because I kept saying I would quit ""next year"". I was working in a stressful environment for subpar pay. This year, I am quitting my job during the onset of an economic downturn. This is the best time to be employed so you can contribute to your investments while the market is down. But, I already set a date and I am 100% sticking to it. 
- **The Switcheroo**: Early in my career, I always made the mistake of thinking my job gave a shit about me. Loyalty is not a valid reason to stay at a job - compensation and work-life-balance are. Each time I have made a career change, my happiness, and usually my compensation - has increased.

## **Asset Classifications**

Classification | Amount | Percent | Note
---|---| --- |----
Taxable Brokerage | $796,564 | 76.2% |
401k | $125,931 | 12% |
Cash | $55,321 | 5.3% | This money should should cover me for the next year. I am buying a parcel in Michigan in case the impending climate emergency gets out of control. 
Roth IRA | $46,494 | 4.4% |
Crypto | $12,935 | 1.2% | Doing a bit of gambling. I hit a 5x last time ($80k) so figured I would try my luck again while the market is down. 
HSA | $8,759 | 0.9% |

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/qsKgajv.png) is a pie chart of these classifications. 

Asset Classification Takeaways:

- **Boring is Better**: For the most part, I have been following the classic Boglehead approach that many of us here are following. I max out by 401k, HSA, and Roth IRA (backdoor) before contributing to my taxable brokerage. It's funny how boring this investment approach is. It's simple and lacks the dopamine hit that stock picking has. 
- **Share the Wealth**: Sometimes I get so fixated on personal finance that I forget who illiterate the average person is. I have been mentoring a few coworkers lately who have hundreds of thousands of dollars just sitting in their savings account. I haven't been telling them what to buy or anything - just explaining basics like the value of diversification and how unlikely they are to beat the index. I think it's one of the best gifts you can give someone.  
- **Luck**: I know what you are thinking. This guys numbers don't add up. A few things note here. 
  - First, I finally sold my rental house. I bought my home in 2014 for $295k. At the time, I was just being a consumer and wanted a fancy house with way too much square footage. I ended up getting super lucky on the market timing. When I sold it last year, there was $250k left on the mortgage and the buyer paid out $600k. 
  - Second, my company stock makes up a hefty chunk of my compensation at my current company. When I started (my grant date), the stock price was at $83. I sold at $200. I ended up pulling between $300k and $400k the past two year. That's how I hit $1M regardless of the market downturn. 
 

--- 

##  **Asset Allocations**

My taxable accounts, 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA account for **$977,747**  (or **93.5%**) of my net worth. Let's take a look at what that portion of my portfolio is comprised of. 

 Asset | Amount | Percent
--- | --- | ----
VTSAX | $858,613 | 87.8%
VTIAX | $99,052 | 10.1%
Individual Stocks | $13,544 | 1.4%
VNQ | $6,538 | 0.7%

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/AYjqBtu.png) is a pie chart of these asset allocations. 

Asset Allocation Takeaways:

- **Stop Gambling**: I am down **51.4%** (**~$14,000**) on my individual stocks. I'm so stupid. I should really cut my losses and just sell all my individual stocks but I have such a hard time selling when I'm down.
- **Changing the Plan**: In my last post, I mentioned I was following the ""[Core Four Lazy Portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios#Core_four_portfolios)"". As you can see, this is no longer the case. It's partially out of laziness and partially strategic. Please tear me to shreds if you disagree with any of my moves here. 
  - I pulled out of bonds simply because I'm young and really don't mind the risk exposure at this point in my life. 
  - I stopped contributing to REIT's (VNQ) because I owned a home at the time of my last post and felt like I had enough exposure to real estate at that time. 
  - I stopped being anal about balancing my international (VTIAX) and domestic (VTSAX) exposure. Maybe I'm just being lazy.  
- **Don't Be Biased**: When my company stock vested, I help onto it for a while because I worked at the company and believed in the mission. At one point, one of my coworkers asked me if I would invest in the company if I had cash. My answer was no. I sold the next day. You get the idea.

---

## **Liabilities**

None! Now that I no longer have a house I am debt free. 

--- 

## **Expenses**

I'm not aggressively tracking my expenses like I used to. I have gotten so comfortable with my spending habits that I don't really see the point in focusing my energy towards extreme budgeting. 

That being said, I created [this Sankey chart](https://i.imgur.com/MH2Mt7S.png) to give you a rough idea of what my extrapolated 2022 will look like. Since I always get a bunch of questions about how I create these types of diagrams - [sankeycash.com](https://sankeycash.com/).

I still cook my meals at home. I still don't buy frivolous things. I still don't have an Amazon account. I no longer have a car. It broke down about 9 months ago and I never replaced it as I have a pretty nice bicycle I built. 

*But*, my bills have increased. 

A year ago I moved in with my girlfriend. I gave up my $600 (including bills) living situation for a $1,000 (not including bills) living situation. I pay for 75% of the groceries, bills, rent, etc. She makes far less money than I do. I care about her, want her to have a good standard of living, and I want her to be able to reach her financial goals as I have been able to. So I am happy to help. 


-- 

## **Final Thoughts**

I would just like to thank everyone in this community for the plethora of knowledge. 

I would also like to acknowledge that everyone has different circumstances: different incomes, different educations, different levels of privilege, children vs no children etc.

I hope that these posts don't come off as any sort of humble brag and I know that some of these takeaways don't apply to everyone. 

I think there's this sweet spot between building wealth and living your life and I hope everyone here finds it because lord knows everyone deserves it. I try to work towards it every day!

That's all for this time.

999,financialindependence,"While it is illegal to log into someone else's Instagram account, there are ways to circumvent this law. These methods can include stealing someone's login credentials or access tokens, selling or transferring their account, and posting private or confidential information. While it is unlikely that you will get caught doing so, it is a bad idea to try them. To protect yourself, follow these tips:

First, set up two-factor authentication (2FA). This system protects your account by requiring you to enter a security code sent to your phone or email address. It's also important to use a strong password, one that is difficult to guess and memorable. Another good option is to use a password manager. A password manager can generate secure passwords and store them in one place, and it will also alert you when someone else's account is accessed.

If you do attempt to log into someone's Instagram account, [**buy gmail accounts reddit**](https://accbuzz.com/product/buy-old-gmail-accounts/) they will be notified via phone call or email that you're trying to access their account. This is important, because it's a violation of their privacy and terms of service. In addition, if you're caught, Instagram will sue you. Depending on your location, you could face criminal charges for attempting to access someone else's Instagram account.

If you're worried about the safety of your account, you can install a third-party app to monitor Instagram activity. Most of these apps are very well hidden, so it's unlikely the person you're spying on will ever realize that their account has been hacked. However, some people are concerned that they may accidentally reveal their personal information through the use of a third-party app. This is a risk that you don't want to risk.

log in to Instagram and fill out a form with your details. Choose 'My account has been hacked' in the form. You should also take a screenshot of the code on the page in question. This will help Instagram get your account back.

Another way to protect yourself from being hacked is to use a strong password. Password managers can be a great help in creating strong passwords. It's also important to change your password regularly. If your password is easy to guess, there's a good chance that it's been compromised.

Phishing attempts have become a big problem online. The use of fake websites and links to steal sensitive information is a common technique for stealing login credentials and can land you in jail. A phishing attack can involve a fake Instagram login page, or even sending the credentials directly to the target's email or social account. It's important to always update your password and profile information to protect yourself from such threats.

One way to hack into someone else's Instagram account is to use third-party apps to monitor their phone activity. These apps can also be used to track the online activities of your child. Despite its ease of use, these tools can be quite difficult to use. [**buy gmail accounts with paypal**](https://accbuzz.com/product/buy-gmail-accounts/) If you have a little experience in coding and social networking, then you can try these apps on a person's smartphone and monitor their activity remotely.

If you are concerned about privacy issues, you can use a spy app that can display a person's Instagram password. These apps contain a keylogger that can record keystrokes on a cell phone and reveal the person's password. This feature can be especially useful for parents who worry about their children's online activities.

You can also use mSpy or eyezy to monitor someone's Instagram account. They will be able to see the posts and private messages made by the person. The other method is Mspy, which is listed further down on this page. Regardless of whether you're using a spy app or not, you should only use it when it's legal: [**read more**](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/z8ckps/what_does_dtx_mean_on_instagram/)",Is it Illegal to Log Into Someone's Instagram Account?,1669949067

My parents have always told me ‚Äúdo good in high school, get accepted to a good college, get good grades in college, get a good job and work‚Äù. I did that. I did great in high school and am currently going to a decent college. I have a 3.75 GPA and I‚Äôm a third year. I‚Äôm an applied statistics and data analytics major. I‚Äôve been applying to internships and have been rejected from 12-25 and the rest have not responded‚Ä¶ yet? I feel like I‚Äôm going to end up graduating but not landing a job in the field I majored in‚Ä¶ which is such BS. I worked hard all years of college and can‚Äôt even get an internship.

And what am I really doing anyway by going to college? Taking classes to get a certificate that tells my employer I can do work competent enough for him/her. I will still be working a 9-5 even though I just spend 3-4 years of my life studying. I‚Äôm never going to be an entrepreneur going to college. College just helps you get an upper class 9-5 job. 

So If I don‚Äôt get an internship, it most likely will mean I can‚Äôt get a job and who knows what I‚Äôll end up working‚Ä¶ idk. Man, what has life come to. How does one escape this ‚Äúsociety‚Äù. Even if I wanted to live off the grid in the US, I cant. It‚Äôs not legal to hunt and kill animals if not in hunting season. I would also be living on somewhere were in the woods and would have to hide to avoid being caught by people. Idk it just seems like life is set up to FORCE you to be a worker. John Rockefeller said ‚ÄúI do not wan a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers‚Äù. These are the same people telling you to go to college and get a degree.

I‚Äôm optimistic and hopeful but to anyone maybe thinking of going to college because you don‚Äôt have any other plans after high school, I wouldn‚Äôt do it. You‚Äôre gonna end up majoring in something you‚Äôre not that interested in and switching majors and wasting more time and losing money and your time. Not sure what way one can become financially free but man is it buried away. Not saying college is a scam‚Ä¶ trust me I‚Äôve learned a lot and very thankful for that. But at the end of the day we all want to be able to have families , go on vacations on our own time and for however long we want without some boss telling you, you can only spend 5 days on vacation or else‚Ä¶ idk.",College isn‚Äôt what I thought it would be,1669349741

1022,financialindependence,"Just sharing my story hoping to help others.

I started my FIRE journey 2 years ago with my first high-paying job (contract role). Since I was earning a lot, I got obsessed with making money.

If I was sick, I was working. If it was a public holiday (I am a contractor), I was working. So basically 0 days off except weekends.

I made good money and have savings to last 5 years without a job.

But here is the fun part. My contract role ended 2 months ago. Immediately I started feeling worthless. I started feeling terrible for losing money every day (which I would have been making if I had a job). It was terrible. I had no meaning in life except the job, so I was very upset all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to feel normal now. I feel stupid that I sacrificed all holidays (including the big festivals) just to earn a little more money. For what? Now I have been jobless for 2 months. Taking 2 days off was nothing compared to being unemployed for 2 months. I should have spent more time with my family and lived my life a bit better.

So I can get a loan, and max out the rest of my credit and get about $80k in cash. Start over save my money, and it seven years I‚Äôll have some money saved up with my report clearing up. 


What I don‚Äôt want is my wages garnished or deal with legal issues/jail.

1064,financialindependence,"One of the reasons I seek to FIRE is the simple reason I wish to own more of my time.

Money can be seen as the currency of time. The reason why something costs money is that someone put their time into creating the thing I am buying.  When you spend money, you spend someone else's time they put into serving you. If you are a billionaire, you could spend several lifetimes in a very short amount of time. 

My time is the most important thing I can offer to the world. Be it offering to my friends or family, to work, to enjoyment, or the community. 

This makes our time more precious than we might want to admit. Because the future is inherently unknown, we can never know for sure how much time we have. Do I have 50 years, perhaps only 20?

Who of you has wished you had more time for friends and family? That you could work less and enjoy life more? Some love their work and would do it for free. But a lot of us think they would be happier spending their time in different ways. 

If you look at it this way, every subscription service I pay for, every new car I buy, every time I buy something I don't really need I pay with time I could have used in a more fulfilling way. 

This is why being frugal, saving money, being mindful of how one spends time, and seeking FIRE as a goal is something I strive for, to own my own time.

¬∞ Maximum annual contribution of $6,500
¬∞ Contributions withdrawn tax-free at any age
¬∞ Growth withdrawn:
   ¬∞ Under 59.5, 5 year account: tax and penalty
   ¬∞ Over 59.5: 5 year account: No tax, no penalty
   ¬∞ Over 59.5, &lt;5 year account: Tax, no penalty

1073,financialindependence,"*‚ÄúHow do I make a ton of money‚Äù?*

A crass and often scorned question, yet one we‚Äôve all pondered before. Good faith discussions can be hi-jacked by the spiritual (true wealth is internal), nihilistic (be born rich), or political (wealth is evil). These tangents all contain kernels of truth, but they are not actionable. Here are my personal observations, with a bias towards practicality.

First and foremost, the core tenant of making money in a capitalistic society comes down to some iteration of ‚Äú**provide value to capture value‚Äù**. Early in your career, **developing specialized skills** (e.g. medicine, coding, sales, etc.) is a huge force multiplier to your value add. But to reach true fatFIRE levels of wealth, you also needs to figure out how to scale. Whether as an employee or as an entrepreneur, true wealth comes from the ability to **scale your inputs to produce asymmetric outputs**.

What does that mean? How do I scale? Here are three broad (not mutually exclusive, and certainly non-exhaustive) forms of scale that can be applied in one‚Äôs career.

# Brand

On the enterprise level, this means **intellectual property**, such as Google‚Äôs search algorithm or Pfizer‚Äôs patent on the COVID vaccine. It can also mean **literal brands** such as Hermes handbags or Nike shoes. An established brand serves as a moat against competitors from easily entering your market, resulting in higher profit margins for every subsequent product sold. If you work on building your company‚Äôs brand / protecting your company‚Äôs moat (e.g. software engineer at Google or brand manager at Nike), you will be paid more than those who don‚Äôt, even if they work just as hard.

On the individual level, this means developing a rare and valuable skill set to build a **personal brand**, and then leveraging that brand to create value to society. At the highest level, think Joe Rogan for podcasting or Oprah for television, where their eponymous brands provide value to their massive audiences (and subsequently advertisers). But there‚Äôs plenty of value to capture in smaller, industry specific niches as well. A KOL in oncology can command huge consulting fees designing clinical trials. A popular author of children‚Äôs fiction can generate recurring royalties. A strong brand allows you to decouple your hourly inputs from your monetary outputs and earn at scale.

# Labor

Perhaps the easiest one to understand but the hardest one to properly wield, labor is simply the ability to capture value from other people‚Äôs work. If someone creates $100 of value for you, and you pay them $70, then each additional employee you hire represents $30 in value for you (obviously oversimplified). However, why would anyone in a free society agree to let you do this?

One common reason is **apprenticeship**. Whether in medicine, law, or plumbing, marketable skills in many professions must be learned on the job. Less experienced workers willingly trade labor ‚Äúalpha‚Äù for mentorship, often with the idea of paying it forward down the line. An even more common reason is **risk-mitigation**. Take for example a seasoned freelance graphic designer pregnant with her first child. It would be a perfectly rational decision to trade some annual ‚Äúalpha‚Äù for the security of a bi-weekly paycheck and healthcare benefits of a full-time position working for someone else.

In order for you to capture the value of other people‚Äôs labor, **you must offer something in return**. Cultivate a rare and valuable skill and learn how to teach it to others. Become an empathetic manager that removes your employees‚Äô professional anxieties (payroll, sick leave, working capital, etc.)  Be cognizant that you are one political revolution away from being eaten by your workers. Yet history has proven being able to successfully manage (or coerce) the labor of others is a proven path for building wealth at scale.

# Capital

On Wall Street, this simply means leverage. Traditional ‚Äúhigh finance‚Äù (e.g. PE, VC, HF) firms raise capital from limited partners, charge them a fee to deploy said capital, and then share in any potential profits. It is ostensibly no more difficult to manage $10 billion than it is $1 billion, but the associated fees are 10x more. This is scale, in the way of financiers.

But even in ‚Äúregular‚Äù industries, capital plays a huge role in scaling productivity. Start-ups (even cash flow positive ones) regularly take VC money to accelerate their growth. Mature public companies sell stock to raise capital to fund new projects, and issue dividends / buy-back stocks when there are no profitable projects to pursue. Properly deployed\*\*, capital is the lubricant\*\* that facilitates the creation of profitable ventures.

The sarcastic trope of ‚Äúself-made with a million dollar loan from daddy‚Äù has some merit, but the key is to actually know what to do with the capital once you‚Äôve raised it. There is a difference between working capital and disposable income. Understanding the difference determines whether you work for money or money works for you. **Learn to be financially literate**. Doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be Gordon Gecko but it‚Äôs nearly impossible to get rich without a baseline understanding of how capital markets work.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I posted this last year and it received some interest so I wanted to send out another reminder to the community that this program is gearing up again for the next tax season. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm starting my second year with an agency as a Volunteer Income Tax Assistant (VITA) with a local refugee agency. The program trains you on tax screening so you can provide free tax prep services to people in need. You don't need to have any prior tax experience, they train you on everything. I started last year with very little understanding of how the tax system works (always had someone else file my taxes), and now I've gained deep understanding of the tax code. VITA programs offer an impactful way for people in this community to use their skills and their passion to give back.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not advocating for a particular program, but if you google VITA in your local area I bet you'll find some programs. A lot of them are even fully virtual. Seems like a great way to help out whether you're FIRE'd or not.

Most mentally sound and physically attracted women settle down before age 30. Most people who are religious marry young.

Not having any experience at 30 is a death signal. It tells women ""no one wants to be this guy and for most likely a good reason."" Maybe you are physically ugly, maybe you have autism, maybe you are shy, maybe you have a low income job, maybe you still live with your parents.

A woman wants a man who can take care of himself and her. That's why most women will not date someone who makes less than them.

So if you have made it to 30 without ever having as much as a kiss, you are basically so far behind you will never have a healthy organic romantic relationship with a woman ever in your life. That's just the facts.

During these 7 years we have traveled a lot and are planning to leave our country to explore more of this big world. And if we ever get tired of traveling we don't plan to settle down in our country. So I don't think we would need this apartment.

If we sold the place right now we would have around 220K left after paying off the loan and investing that amount in a fund like the S&amp;P500 would result in average of 10% yearly profit or around 22k yearly.

If we keep the place and rent for 1300 a month, that would be 18K a year, but from that we would have a 700 monthly payment (8500 yearly) for the loan.

1128,financialindependence,"Hey guys, first time posting on r/financialindependence, been lurking for quite some time. Before anything, I want to say that I've been reading most tips here and I've learned quite a lot. 

So, as the title says, I'm 25 years old with a net worth just shy of 700k. 99% of it was gained on crypto, which I cashed out a few months ago, so I have 700k cash sitting in a bank account atm.

I find that the current economic times brought us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest and create generational wealth, so I'm looking to take a more grown-up approach and invest wisely.

So my question is, I'm debating over going 50/50 on stocks and ETFs. For individual stocks, I would go with GOOG, MSFT, NVDA, HD, and one or two more. The rest to put in some global ETF. 

Since most stocks took a beating and had an insane drop in %ytd, what's the play here? All in ETF? Do a 50/50? I tolerate risk fairly well and don't take it into much consideration. Isn't the upside totally worth any risk involved? I know the consensus is ETF and chill. 

The plan is to retire at 45 in a fairly stable way. My income is 1000‚Ç¨ per month in a poor country.

What would be the play here? Keep risking or play it safe?

Also, I don't own a house or any property and don't plan to do it until I have some stability in terms of work. I own a car and since I love cars I don't mind spending 30/40k on one even if it delays retirement down the line.

I understand that it is generally recommend to invest in a 401k first, because of matching/ taxes/ higher investment amount, then a Roth IRA because of tax advantages. After that, if you have those maxed out and have money left over, I imagine the rest of your money should go into a regular brokerage account. #1. I don‚Äôt understand why it is not best to simply have 1 brokerage account to throw all your money in. For example, if you have $40,000  to invest, ~30k goes in to 401k and Roth, and then 10k goes to the brokerage account. It is my understanding that investments grow exponentially- if you have more money in an account, it compounds more quickly. Wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to throw 40k into one account to allow it to grow exponentially more quickly? The capital gains tax where is live is like 9%. Even with that, I feel like it would end up being more money if you maximized the investment into one account. # 2 if I were to own the same stock in multiple accounts, does that mean anything? If I have VTSAX (or whatever it is) in a 401k and an IRA, is that anything? #3 is JL Collins 80-100% VTSAX and 0-20% bonds sufficiently diversified? It makes sense to me as it‚Äôs the whole market, but I feel like I‚Äôve seen online that that is not sufficient diversification and you need global total market too and even both aren‚Äôt enough etc.  #4 this one is the most silly, but I feel like I‚Äôve seen online both that you do and do not have to pay income tax on 401k and Roth IRA, so I‚Äôm not really sure which one is true.

1165,financialindependence,"Hi all. I'm looking to discuss different approaches to FIRE regarding early career investing versus calculated debt payoffs.

My wife and I have a combined income of around $175K yearly in a LCOL. We have virtually zero debt beyond student loans. Student loans are around $100K capped at $500/monthly with 5% interest. This looks due to be even lower thanks to Biden's new plan, maybe $250/monthly?

Over the next 3 years using all of our discretionary income, I'm trying to decide whether it would make more sense to put $100,000 into a taxable investment account, or to pay off student loan(s) completely. At this young age, wouldn't every dollar I save hypothetically be worth 5-10x that by average FIRE age? Is there any reason I should not just keep using an IBR program to infinitely pay such a low monthly?

Combined, my wife and I make around $175K yearly.

It looks like with Bidens changes that could drop even lower, possibly halve, and not accrue interest.

Recently, a few people have told me I'm better off aggressively paying down her student debt. Could anyone please help me understand why this could be better than just letting compound interest do its thing and paying the minimum ibr?

So as the title says I'm planning an early retirement to Thailand. It won't be full retirement as I would probably get bored out of my mind. Here's a little background though:

I'm in my early 30s
I've worked for a large consulting firm for some time
Own a business with two partners that is going quite well
I've also opened about 6 businesses in my life plus 4 (one current) were successful
Sold the properties I owned this year and am in the process of liquidating my last few cars

Basically I'm at the point where I'm tired of working for other people and am well off enough or at least have a sustainable enough revenue stream to live off of by moving internationally. I'm planning on moving to Bangkok in July of next year so am starting the process now and had a few questions plus wanted some insight incase someone saw a flaw.

Open thai bank account
Purchase elite visa
Vet check for my dog
Find a condo

Money in:
Savings: 7 figures but don't plan on dipping into that for a while. 
Disability income: ~$4000
Investment income: +/- $2600 now after selling properties
Business income: we haven't taken an owners draw yet but I was planning to pay myself a modest $8,000 a month. 

Monthly Income loss (quitting): ~$24,000 pretax

Money out:
Rent: ~$3000 (yes you can do it cheaper but I'm looking at a nicer place)
Utilities: $120 rough guess
Phone: $40
Monthly eating/ dining: $20 a day - $600
Entertainment budget: $1200
Misc expenses (slush) - $500

Total - $5,460

So fianances would be $14,600 - 5460 = 9140. Less if I divest my owners draw into simply a savings were at 1140 for personal savings.

1170,financialindependence,"Not super familiar with the finer details of FIRE, but have been interested in retiring early from a young age. I'm wondering if anyone has had experience doing a ""mid-life"" retirement. AKA stopping work (or perhaps continuing part time), without all the money needed to permanently retire, but taking 2,3,4,5,10, whatever many years off you can without running completely out of money, with the intention of getting back to work at some point again once funds run lower. 

This largely comes from a place of being sick and tired of full time work, and wanting to make my 20's and 30's while my body is still capable of a lot really count. The biggest concern of course being the ultimate, dreaded return to work. Will I be dreading returning to work, even if it's say 5 years away? Is this a waste of savings? Am I simply too impatient? 

I can't help but wonder of the possibility that I will find something to still make money while I'm in temporary retirement. I'm a super curious person and like to stay busy enough. I've recently looked into proofreading/ editing part time as an option. If I do well enough in the stock market perhaps partial retirement could turn into full retirement, but I obviously shouldn't count on that whatsoever. Just curious on people's thoughts or experiences with this.

1178,financialindependence,"I'm a 22M that's been coding since I was 10, lined up a software development job out of HS, in ~3 years became SDE II at Amazon. Total compensation went 90k-115k-125k-260k not including retirement contributions. In total I saved ~$400k, investment growth (happened to almost perfectly time a trade into small value AVUV from VOO which helped a lot) brought me up to my current net worth of $660k.

I got fired from Amazon a few months ago basically because I'm a garbage and defective human being that procrastinates everything to comical lengths thus unable to get any work done. I've looked back and realized I deliver negative value as an employee while personally feeling like shit for doing so, so I'm retiring. I've been trying some other jobs and work arrangements like folks suggested, but the same issues destroyed me every time even trying to work 10 hrs\mo so fuck it, I'm done.

I moved to LCOL and my expenses are staying well within my $28k\yr target. It's pretty easy since all I want to do is play video games and read webtoons, I literally haven't stepped outside in months lol.

[Here's the expense breakdown](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/330538905072041994/1037921166666506250/Screenshot_20221103_212234.png)

All utilities are included in my $825 rent payment, so that's stable. The internet here is pretty great value IDK why, but the $15\mo phone is because I switched to Mint mobile now that I've stopped ever going outside.

I burn $600\mo on food because all of it is delivered from restaurants. I'm the laziest person ever if that wasn't obvious yet.

All my gaming stuff I have rn totaled about $2000 when I bought it 2 years ago, with a 1660ti and i7-9850h which look like they'll handle most stuff coming out for another 3-5 years fairly well. I also got a Galaxy S22 for $700 which is supported for 5 years. I amortize all that to ~$500\yr for a reasonable electronics budget.

The $1250\yr for vacations and $250\yr for clothes is just the average from my adult life, really I'll probably spend less going forward considering I didn't enjoy any of those vacations a whole lot. Healthcare is the most unknown, but according to ACA estimators it should be between free (Medicaid) and $300\yr depending on how much capital gains I realize.

Maid service is only $80\mo because my standards for cleanliness are low enough that I only have it every 6 weeks. Actually at one point I went over a year without cleaning my place at all, only after moving and noticing my allergies? mysteriously disappear did I realize I should spend a little on this if possible lol.

Those with good mental math probably noticed $28k is more than 4% of $660k, and the 4% rule in the first place is quite risky considering how long of a retirement I'm looking at while not even qualifying for Social Security. I explain why it's fine and why I'm really following a 3% SWR [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/xodxgx/daily_fi_discussion_thread_monday_september_26/iq1fep0/).

Even including those attempts to find a bearable job that kept reviving my procrastination, self-loathing, insecurities, etc the past months since Amazon fired me have been enjoyable...pretty sure they're the longest contiguous time I've been happy to be alive.

1. Bought a 2017 Lexus ES 350 and still owe about 15k

2. Student loans are paid off

3. I still live at home (I don‚Äôt want to rent so I‚Äôm waiting to buy a house)

4. I have no credit card debt

5. I have 30k in a Roth IRA

6. I have 30k in my Roth 401k (it‚Äôs the TSP) (5% match)

7. I have about 5k in the bank

8. My after tax paycheck is about $2,100 and it paid biweekly 

9. I‚Äôm provided a work car so commuting is free

10. My job has a pension. Each year you work you earn 1.7% towards your pension and it‚Äôs based off your highest 3 years of salary. For example, if I made 100k for 20 years, my highest 3 salaries would be 100x and you would multiply that by 34% (20 years x 1.7%).

I would like to know a few basic things such as the following:

1. Any money saving tips that aren‚Äôt too extreme?

2. What price range can I afford for a house?

3. How much should I be saving?

4.  I max out my Roth IRA but should I be putting more than the 5% in my 401k?

1208,financialindependence,"Since I got into the FIRE journey(getting older and having family as I guess), I have been debating in my mind many times what kind of mindset I should have towards my career. Should I work as hard as I can or just chill out if things are going decent.

I consider myself lucky as I have never been a hard worker but my income increased significantly and quickly . I was able to  increased my salary from 67k as new grad back in 2013 to 160k in 2018 with a fully remote position (Engineering field but not in IT/software). 

So far I have been just chill through my whole career between the top companies in this layback industry. I am currently making 178k total comp and working 25-35hr per week fully remote at home.

Last week I went through the Amazon interview and got a offer from Amazon with about 10% increase of my current total comp. Again, not in software or main business of Amazon but in my same industry. So the work life balance shouldn't be bad but most likely require more effort/hours than my current job. On top of that, it requires quite a bit of travelling: 1 one-week long, 2 two-week long and 1 one-month long travel which will put a lot of work and stress on my wife with two young kids.

I have been thinking all days in the past few days and really struggling to make a decision. Financially, I  don't think it make sense to do it because I probably make less or the same per hour. But on the other hand, it is definitely a step up in my career and will set me up for better in the future or open up other roads in my career. 

I always wonder if our career should be like our investment strategy:  The most boring investment strategy/companies that do the same thing over and over but making money consistently is the best way to go.

Here are some numbers if you are interested:

# FIRE progress 

**I am currently 34 with a wife at 31 and two 5 y/o twins. I am targeting to FIRE by 47(45-50).**

**Total net worth: 1.3 mil**

**Real-estate: 800k equity** 

* 740k primary residence(debt: 420k )
* 540k house parents live in (own by me, debt: 250k)
* 300k rental (debt:95k)

**Total invested: 480k (150k in Roth)**

**Cash: 40k**

&amp;#x200B;

# Current job:

**Total comp:178k**

* Base pay: 138k
* Bonus: 22k
* RSU:7K
* 401k match(6%):10k

**Pro**

* Fully remote
* Prefect manager (can't really think of one bad thing about him)
* very flexible hour(I rarely do work after 2 or 3pm) 
* Very good benefit 25 day PTO, 10 day sick leave.
*  A lot of freedom and opportunity for self learning in term of time, project and resource.
* zero travel

**Con**: slow growth for salary

&amp;#x200B;

# Amazon:

**Total comp: 200k**

* Base pay: 140k
* Cash Bonus: 50k
* RSU:7K
* 401k match(2%):4k

Cash bonus will ramp down and RSU ramp up at the first 4 years to keep the total comp at 200k. Stock price is a factor but I think it is a good timing as the whole market is low now.

**Pro**

* Advance in a career for future job hopping
* Gain new skill (same industry but different and more niche field which should have better job security )
* Looks cool?

**Con**

* A lot of travel (per year): 1x1week + 2 x2week + 1 month
* More working hour and higher stress are expected. after all it is Amazon..
* need to be in office 2 days per week. 1hr commute one way
* less PTO
* probably worse health insurance","Working as hard as you can vs Chill, slow and steady to achieve FIRE [With Family]",1668544105

 Cashflows $1,500 and mortgage payments are $705. Free cashflow per month is $795.

* Main Source: $4,580 (already after taxes)
* Rental 1: $1,250 (This house is paid off, est. Redfin value $100k)
* Rental 2: $795 (House from above, with mortgage.)

So my income is $6,625.

**Here are my monthly expenses:**

* Groceries: $400
* Gym: $120
* Gas: $150
* Misc: $250

$920 in monthly expenses.

I live at home with my parents rent free, my car is paid off, and I have zero credit card debt. So total **net income after expenses is $5,705.** 

I am 26 years old and I do not drink, do drugs, or use dating apps. I'm fiercely focused on my family, health, and financial situation above all else.

* Max out 401(k) and Roth IRA contributions
* $2,800-3,000 expenses
* $2k net income, which goes towards the broken dream of owning a house

For example, this month I brought in an additional $3k income and I'm over here struggling to treat myself to a nice $25 meal. It usually becomes an inner battle where I contemplate between cheap &amp; boring vs. expensive &amp; enjoyable. Often times I just get frustrated and say fuck it and don't do anything.

He limited spending on his hobbies. He seemed happy, but I'm not sure he was living the life he wanted to live while he was living, and I'm sad about that. 

He centered his life around the idea of retiring early and then living the life he really wanted, but won't get to do that.

1252,financialindependence,"Family of 4 (2 young children).  Our average expenses per month are $12,000.  It typically wavers anywhere from about $10k per month to $14k for months with unforeseen spending.  This includes everything from business expenses to food to daycare to the mortgage, car payments, insurance, utilities, entertainment, dining.  Literally everything.  

We don't spend a lot of money outside of necessity, which is what really irks me.  We don't have terrible habits, we don't have shopping addictions and since our kids were born we do a pretty minimal amount of traveling.  That's why the idea that we are averaging this much spend per month is so absurd to me.  

We don't have an expensive house (mortgage roughly $2k/mo).  We dont have expensive cars  ($550/mo loan payment).  We try to keep our dining/delivery budget to about $300/mo.  We cook a lot of our own meals.

Our biggest expenses are childcare ($3000/mo) 
Mortgage/PMI/HOA ($2400/mo)
Business expenses (wife is business owner and I also have a small business) ($1000/mo)
Groceries ($1000/mo)
Medical stuff ($800)
Utilities/insurance ($800)
Car payment ($550)
Shopping/kids clothes/necessary items ($500)
Student loans ($400)
Dining/drinks ($350)

Entertainment ($200)
Software subscriptions/YouTube TV ($150)
Pet/dog costs ($150)
Health/wellness stuff ($100)
Various other small things.  

I know that the $3k in childcare costs will decrease a lot in a year or 2, and then completely go away in about 4 years.  So there's a bright side there.  And in addition, there are some medical bills which will also be paid off in a year.  But apart from that - I feel as though we are pretty disciplined in our lifestyle.  Dealing with colder temperatures by putting a sweater on and using less heat to save $30 a month is such a drop in the bucket that it feels stupid to even worry about.  Spending $100 less here and there on delivery is such a miniscule amount because it's already a small amount.

So my situation is that I am an average earner that has saved approx enough for a decent deposit on a 2 bed apartment ( in this city ‚Äì could buy a house somewhere else) that could house my daughter and I. I also invested steadily in ETFS which I could sell. I did not buy property 6 years ago when I met my partner as assumed we would move in together and buy somewhere. This meant that property prices have increased significantly, and my buying power has been almost destroyed. Meanwhile unfortunately, despite his very high salary he has not managed to save a deposit. Some of this is his fault and some of it is bad luck. For him to match my deposit it will take years and that means house prices will be even higher ( they are dropping a little right now but due to increased interest rates still crazy $$)  

 So, my issue is this what to do now? If we stay renting in this city prices will increase annually. If we buy a 4 /5 bedroom house I will have to use my entire life savings as a deposit, which to be honest makes me incredibly nervous. It‚Äôs taken me years and a lot of discipline to get to this point. It will, however, give me a stake in a house that I would never be able to afford normally. We do not have joint finances due to the blended situation ( and TBH some resentment from me around being the saver when he earns so much) so I don't know where I could start with trying to work out who pays what. He of course due to his larger income and more kids would pay a much larger proportion of the mortgage (and of course I would never get this kind of mortgage without his income but equally he could not without my deposit) Having been divorced once I am loath to risk it all again but equally, I don‚Äôt want to continue renting / leave my amazing, noisy, new family. So I guess I need advice re should I buy an IP outside of this city that I can leave to my daughter / and that I or hopefully we can retire in one day. Or should I throw it all in with my partner and accept that even with a small deposit that it's better than renting and it will hopefully increase in value over the years.

1293,financialindependence,"I recently started on the mega back door path and thought I made a mistake when I chose After-tax to Roth In Plan Conversions. However my plan allows in service withdrawals and Fidelity told me that whether they are After-Tax or Roth-In-Plan-Conversions (RIPCs), either are eligible for in service withdrawals however traditional and Roth 401(k) monies are not eligible. For whatever reason, they track Roth 401(k) and RIPC monies separately.

Anyway, I have to transfer those monies (after-tax or RIPC) to a Roth IRA manually but I can do it every paycheck if I want to. However, and this was made very clear to me, both of these monies would be counted as ‚Äúconversions‚Äù in my Roth IRA and NOT ‚Äúcontributions.‚Äù So there wouldn‚Äôt be any benefit for me to not do automatic RIPCs as far as I can tell. In fact, RIPCs would be better because they are performed automatically with no potential of taxable earnings generated. So if that‚Äôs the case then I just need to perform a single RIPC to Roth IRA rollover every year to set up the ladder. Right?

The Fidelity guy, although very knowledgeable, didn‚Äôt know if ‚Äúconversions‚Äù count as ‚Äúcontributions‚Äù in terms of whether they would be subject to early withdrawal penalties.

But that‚Äôs what the whole Roth ladder really depends on, doesn‚Äôt it? If conversions didn‚Äôt count as contributions then you‚Äôd be subject to the penalties?

1305,financialindependence,"Hello everyone. 

I [33M] am currently a renter. I did own a home but I sold it last year. I no longer lived in the area, had no interest in being a landlord, and it had doubled in value since I had bought it. 

I see interest rates rising. If home values drop enough or if I see something I really like, I may decide to buy instead of renting.  

I know that many people who buy homes in a high-interest environment get a mortgage, pay a premium while they wait for rates to drop, and then refinance.

My question is, can you buy all-cash, wait for rates to come down, and then get a mortgage? Does it ever make sense to do this? Are the interest rates different when you put a mortgage on a home later vs when you buy it?

The other thing that's hard to predict assuming this approach is possible is if it's financially beneficial. If I sink $500k into a home while I wait for mortgage rates to come down, how much could I have made in the meantime by parking that money in index funds?

The company I was working for laid me off yesterday, and while my true FIRE number is a bit higher than where I'm at today, I have enough to take a very long break or to supplement my savings with side-gigs or part-time work.

I'm looking forward to being able to focus full-time on my hobbies as well as to connect more with friends and family (I haven't been terrible at this, but I could do better). I enjoy climbing, chess and running, and have a few goals related to those hobbies. Rough goals are:

-Climb a 5.13 by the end of next year (currently ~12c, but have sent 12d within the past few years)
-Place well in the U1800 section at the World Open in 2023 (I won U1500 at the North American Open and tied for 4th in the North American Open within the past 2 years)
-Run a trail 50k next year

I used to stream on twitch for SC2 before I began my career (back in 2012). I'd love to be able to supplement my savings with some income through that, but have no concrete plans at the moment. Perhaps there's still space for some chess content :)

The numbers:

Assets:
-50k Cash (TBD on how much I want to keep in cash vs. invested at any point in time)
-400k Brokerage Account
-200k 401k

Debt:
-350k Mortgage @ 2.8%, home is worth ~525k

Expenses/Budget:
-1,000 for home costs net of rent (I have two roommates and have room for a 3rd if I need to cut back expenses)
-350 groceries
-150 eating out
-250 phone bill/gym membership/car insurance
-150 gas
-TBD Health Insurance

Assuming health insurance ends up being $300/mo, this puts me at 26,400 in necessary expenses every year. At a 4% withdrawal rate on my more liquid accounts, I have 18,000 to work with. So technically not quite FIRE, but I only need to make 8,400 doing to cover those costs, plus maybe 2-3k to cover things like vacations, entertainment, replacing outdoor equipment, etc.

1353,financialindependence,"I've recently been re-evaluating retirement saving and taxes in general after taking a higher paying job. I've been a long time Dave Ramsey listener, and have always heard that you should prefer Roth (IRA or 401k) accounts because they grow tax free. The logic being that the growth will be much larger than the initial investment for most retirement time horizons.

But... \[I put together a spreadsheet to verify this logic\]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1utdqhLv-TmoAYDai9etHkx70sQHZe8cLee-WDnDEMC0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1utdqhLv-TmoAYDai9etHkx70sQHZe8cLee-WDnDEMC0/edit?usp=sharing)). If you assume that you use the tax savings to invest the total amount (ie you invest $10k with the traditional account but only $7.6k with the Roth) and that the tax rate will be the same (big assumption I know), the end safe withdrawal amount ends up being exactly the same.

So on the surface it would seem that it is just a matter of if you think your tax rate will be higher or lower in retirement. But when you make contributions to a Roth account, you're effectively being taxed at your highest tax bracket. Even if your tax bracket largely remained the same, when you withdraw from a retirement account you would at least pay a lower tax rate on the first brackets worth of income.

1377,financialindependence,"I'm starting a sabbatical in just a few days, which may turn into a longer form ""retirement.""  We'll just have to see how it goes.

We have about 3.5M in various savings/assets, and about $100k/year living expenses.  Ages 46/42.

While unconventional, I'm considering taking advantage of the very generous TIPS rates right now (Inflation + 1.72% on 30 year) and locking in about 2.6M in TIPS (which would put me at a 25/75 equity/bond split.)

Here's my logic.  Let's assume 0% inflation to keep things easy.  (That works, because TIPS should cancel out the effects of inflation.)

Year 1.  2.650M in bonds pays out 45,580 in interest.  Sell $54k of the bonds.  

Year 2.  2.595M in bonds pays out $44,644 in interest.  Sell $55k of the bonds.

Year 3.  2.54M in bonds pays out $43,600 in interest.  Sell $56k of bonds.

When also accounting for Social Security payments, this would hit the bottom of the bucket at about age 100. 

I'd still have about 800k growing in the market from day 1 (my 25% equity portion).

Pros/Cons/Risks:  

Pro:   Nearly guaranteed.  Can spend up to my yearly amount without fear.  No concerns about market fluctuations or inflation eroding spending power.  Would have the side bucket of equities for legacy/heirs or splurges.

Con:  Very little upside.  I'd have a 100k lifestyle -- but would never have ""multi-million dollar"" means.  (But I'm not really much of a spender anyway.)  Taxes would eat a bit, but not much, since my ""married filing jointly"" taxable income from the bonds would be very low.

Risks:  The biggest risk here is longevity.  I have to plan for about 54 years of potential life remaining (we can only hope).  However, the longest TIPS bond term is 30 years.  So the biggest glaring risk here is that TIPS rates will be low (or negative) 30 years from now.  In 30 years, I would have about 886k in today's dollars remaining.  Assuming a SPIA in a low rate environment, I could probably get $30-40k/year guaranteed (not adjusted for inflation) + Soc Security + my bucket of side money as a safety net.  

I suppose there is also risk in hanging my hat on Social Security.  But hopefully I'm at an age now where that risk of non-payment or reduced payments is lower than it would be if I were younger.

Currently, I earn about 105-115K depending on bonuses. This new role will provide the opportunity to earn more commission.

When I was first brought into the organization I was given a pretty hefty sign on bonus, is there opportunity have another sign on bonus with accepting a new job at the same organization?

In addition, I have direct experience connections and will require have to training of an outside higher - all valuable items to the employer that cut their cost as well. I‚Äôm not sure what the salary range is for this position as it is pretty tight lipped, however, due to my age, I feel as if I will be on the lower end. I will be by far the youngest territory manager in the entire organization by about a decade. 

I am honored to be considered and excited about the opportunity, but can‚Äôt help but feel that they are exploiting my age a little bit , as I have been a top producer in the last two years, I feel I will carry this out and just want to get a fair shake.

I am just wondering if I am making a reasonable step for my family from a financial perspective. I won't go into too much detail with regards to location or career.

Old job: LCOL city, family friendly, remote job. Current salary about 120k + 10% equity + 3% 401k match + 5% target bonus (I have never received less than a 5/5 rating though, which is associated with a 12% bonus). TCO that I calculated is about 150k.

New job: MCOL city, larger city can be family friendly. Non remote job. Salary will likely be around 145k + 20% target bonus + 34k x 4 years sign on bonus (I am not sure if I misheard this - maybe 34k in 4 years?).

From a compensation and career growth perspective, I think the new job fits better.

Thing is... I have a 2.5 year old and a 3 month old at home. We just bought a 500k house last year at 3% interest, and I have a rental bought at 225k @ 3.5% interest rate (+500 / month cashflow, before repairs). Moving means I will likely sell these two properties and take a loss. Not to mention the new job is in TX so property tax is very high (looking at increase from 3k to 9k per year I think). We are in a 4/3 right now, but will likely settle into a 3/2.5 after moving, with both properties being valued about the same.

However,if I'm honest; my real goal is not to retire at said age. My goal is to keep going to eventually amass an obscene amount of wealth during my lifetime to make sure my children, grandchildren and perhaps the generation after that do not need to choose their profession based on the need to provide themselves with a good quality of life. So they would be free to pursue professions that they desire without it having to be a profession that pays well.

1423,financialindependence,"**Background**

I am a late 40s professional living and working in Singapore (born and bred), married with no children. 

**Financial situation**

I currently make about S$400,000 a year (US$258,000) post tax , and my net assets are worth about S$2.8m (US$2m), with my principal assets being S$1.5m in global equities/bond ETFs, S$400,000 in a Singapore STI ETF and the rest in a mixture of some bond funds and cash instruments. 

My wife earns less than me, but she's more of a saver and has about the same amount of retirement assets as me. So we have about US$4m as a family. 

The above excludes the net value of my primary residence (about US$2m) and mandatory government savings scheme (CPF). 

Long and short, we are probably financially independent-ish today, based on our fairly frugal lifestyle. I say independent-ish because even though the nest egg may look comfortable to some, if we have to live off savings today, we have to fund quite a long retirement period of 40 years or more, unlike say someone who retires later at 65 and has to fund a shorter (20 years shorter) retirement period. This substantially longer period introduces far more uncertainty into the equation. Given that a fair amount of my net worth is exposed to the equities markets, and the current market turmoil, I am also exposed to potentially substantial variations in my assets.

**My job**

For privacy, I won't go into details, but I've been doing my job for a substantial period of time, and I have seniority and status in my position. I generally call the shots within my role and have very little interference from my boss. I have a small team reporting to me, and am comfortable with the responsibilities placed on me. The job is stable and I do not fear retrenchment or downsizing. My hours are extremely reasonable and the actual job requirements are not demanding beyond my ability. 

The above are the admittedly substantial upsides. However, as should be obvious since I'm writing this post, there are downsides to my job. 

\- The organisation is dysfunctional and in order to cope with what happens, I generally have to ignore it and not attempt to fight it. This is a function of the organisation's ownership and corporate culture. These overall cultural idiosyncrasies create frequent stress points for me, in frustration about management weaknesses, dealing with incompetent colleagues who have found a niche in this organisation and extreme inefficiences in how we operate.  I also feel extremely mis-aligned with the purpose and culture of the organisation and feel that this is an entirely transactional relationship, where I don't get, nor expect, anything more than a pay cheque. I don't get job satisfaction nor feel that I am fulfilling any other purpose, than to fatten my retirement portfolio.

\- Given my role as a control function, the small size of my team and no meaningful deputy to rely on, I find it hard to switch off from my job. This is not to say I have to respond to emails or check on things 24/7, but due to my personality, I have never been able to mentally switch off. I do not enjoy vacations or time off, as I find it extremely stressful to think about leaving the role unattended for any meaningful amount of time. Given the number of years that I have not been able to switch off, this has snowballed and has affected my mental health. 

\- With (a) the misalignment between my organisation and my aspirations, and (b) the long period of not being able to switch off, I have been exhibiting classic signs of burn out and depression for some time now, and have difficulty enjoying anything anymore. I am quick to anger and pre-judge people and situations, and occasionally take out my frustrations on colleagues and others. I am neglectful of my family's needs and, given that I am generally reserved and introverted, any time I don't spend on work is time I want to spend alone. So I spend extremely little time with family or friends, or checking up on them. This ironically also snowballs into additional stress for me, as I feel guilty in how I am neglectful. 

**Sabbatical / early retirement / career pivot**

I have found myself thinking more and more about taking a break, and have less and less patience about doing my job. I am thinking of taking a sabbatical to take time off to rest, and emerge from the cocoon that I have been in. 

I am fortunate in that I can fund quite a number of years of my living expenses without working, but I am not certain that even if I can, that this is what I want to. I would also feel more comfortable with some more 'padding' added to my retirement portfolio, both in terms of reducing the number of years I will need to fund, and also adding to the nest egg. Even doing one (reducing the number of years I will need to fund by working a lower paying job that pays for my daily expenses) will meaningfully go towards my financial security. 

An alternative is that I take time off to explore other ways to spend my time meaningfully, including to pivot my career into something else entirely, which gives me more purpose on a day to day basis. Honestly, though, I have no idea what this might be. 

**Sabbatical cons**

Given the above, I am thinking of taking a sabbatical. The main 'cons' of doing so, in my mind, are as follows:

\- **Sabbatical not solving anything.** I am concerned that taking a sabbatical won't solve anything and that what I really need is an attitude adjustment. But given my current mental state, I am not sure whether I can do anything about the attitude adjustment. Alternatives to a sabbatical are (a) to find another job and negotiate a break before I start work or (b) stay where I am and try harder to 'zen out' and to fix the issues I am facing, like hiring a number 2 to take some of the load off. 

\- **Not being able to find a job when I want to come back.**  With the current economic uncertainty, inflation eroding my nest egg faster than it grows and possible recession, I am worried that if, at the end of the sabbatical, I want to come back to full time work, I won't be able to. Or that I panic and before I am ready to, I jump back into another similar job and am back to square one. To caveat, given my skills and experience, I am fairly comfortable that I will be able to find another job (even if I have to earn less), despite my age, but who knows? 

\- **CV gap.** Less off a concern is explaining to my new employer the gap in my CV, but I think this should be less of a concern given that I have more than 20 years of solid employment experience, other than this sabbatical.

1432,financialindependence,"I browsed some threads here and many people say that 1 Million Dollars is not enough to retire in the west for the rest of your life.

I do not understand how they come to this conclusion. All you need to live is a place to sleep, food and health insurance.  You can easily achieve that in pretty much every country of the world with 1 Million dollars in my opinion.

For example you could invest all in the REIT ""Realty Income Corporation"" and you would get 48.700 dollars per year right now. This is around 133 dollars per day. Lets say half of that goes to insurance and rent, you still have 60 dollars to spend every day. This is easily enough for **one** person. With a family it would be more difficult, but still doable in many countries of the world. Even many european countries. There are so many people earning less than 4000 dollars per month and they still can enjoy life. (By the way I live in a country that has no tax on dividends and capital gains)

Another way would be to just buy a condo for like 500.000 Dollars and then invest the remaining 500.000 Dollars in something like REIT ""Realty Income Corporation"". Or buy two condos and rent one of them to others.

For 500.000 you could even get a house/villa in many countries of the world. For example I looked at prices in Dubai and you would be shocked to see what 500.000 gets you there in terms of real estate.

I just dont see how 1 Million wouldnt be enough for one person. Even in the west.

I personally want to work one more year and then retire with 1 Million at age 30. I cant take the constant stress anymore. I earn so much money but I wouldnt say it made me any happier. Since I have a business, I will probably still earn quite a bit passively for the next few years after retiring, so I dont have to withdraw money from my investments right away. The things I enjoy the most are for free or very cheap, like being in nature, sports, gaming, socializing, reading books. Even traveling can be quite cheap if you do it right.

I have no need to buy expensive clothes or cars. I couldnt care less about luxury or impressing others, I just want freedom.

Also I will inherit the house of my parents, which is at least worth 1 Million dollars. I hope this will be far in the future, but at some point my parents will die. They are 64 yo right now. I dont see how I could run out of money.",Why do some people say 1 Million isnt enough to retire?,1667533603

1434,financialindependence,"I went to art school, and graduated in 2010 with a degree in Interactive Development and Game Design. I managed to land myself an internship at a startup game developer, which turned into a full-time job as a junior game designer. I started at $55k. 

After a while, I decided (unwisely, in retrospect) to quit my entry-level job and try to pursue a career as a freelance game developers. This was back when indie games were really taking off, and I thought maybe I could do it too. 

At first, things went well. I got a contract job as an artist for a game company, which allowed me the freedom to work from home and work on developing my own game in my spare time.

Things started going badly after that. I realized I was dealing with major depression and social anxiety, and began drinking more heavily. I continued working on my contract job, but my attempts to develop my own game went nowhere.

Eventually it got to the point where I felt lost. I tried going out for some interviews to get back into a game studio but they didn't go well. Truth be told, I gave up fairly easily and fell back on my contract job to make ends meet.

Eventually, though, the contract ended and I was unable to replace the work. I was forced to start picking up odd jobs, which was a big blow to my ego and self esteem. I worked at a supermarket and as a concierge and as a dog walker. This went on for years until I had more or less given up on my game development / game artist career.

Things got worse before they got better. I fell deeper into depression and alcohol. I eventually found some work as a graphic designer and more odd jobs as an artist. I also moved to a state with a much lower cost of living. I was able to scrape by on about $2,000 / $2,500 a month.

I kept trying to figure out a way to get back on a proper career path, but I feel like I keep fizzling out before I can focus on any path long enough to make meaningful progress. 2D Art, graphic design, game design, animation, other random skillsets - never really going deep enough to become competitive or hire-able in that niche.

Then I got a random windfall a little over a year ago. I made a $2,000 crypto investment back in 2017 and thought I had been locked out of, and was unable to recover my account. Fortunately they changed their account recovery backend and years later I was able to recover my investment. ""Overnight"" I made $65,000. This was right before crypto crashed in December 2021. 

I tried to do my best with it, and took most of it out and put it into savings and Betterment. I unfortunately left some if it in crypto and painfully watched the value collapse. I used some of it to pay off the rest of my car and some of it for some unexpected vet bills for my dog which amounted to $4,000. 

Now I'm left with around $21,000, zero debt, and a fully paid off car.

However, I still have zero idea what the fuck I'm doing with my career. I have a part time job that pay surprisingly well, but it is little more than a stop gap measure. Occasionally I'll do design jobs or art jobs for random amounts of money $50 here, $75 there, but it is inconsistent and infrequent.

I'm not sure how to translate the photoshop, illustration, and design skills I have back into a full-time job. So much time has passed, so much regret and shame has built up around my feelings of failure, I don't know how to shake it and get a clear direction for my future.

Sometimes I think I should totally start over and try to pursue a more lucrative career out of a hat, like data analysis or sales. However it feels foolish to abandon the skills and experience that I've already built up for something brand new.

Does anyone here have advice on getting my shit together ""late' in life? Has anyone else dealt with losing their way in their late twenties / early thirties, and how they found a way forward? I don't want to make a ton of money, I just want to have a respectable job that gives my life a sense of direction and purpose.

Thank you in advance for any help and advice.",I am 34 and I don't know what the hell I'm doing with my career path.,1667525001
