Is there any prepaid card that i can buy and load with PayPal balance?

\- I can't order the PayPal prepaid card because it's not available in my country

\- I can't transfer the PayPal balance to my local bank account and withdraw it on a ATM in the US

2,personalfinance,"I just got an Elan Max Cash Preferred (yay!) and I'm wondering about the rewards. The website is giving me seemingly contradictory information, and i'm wondering whether I have anything to worry about.

**TLDR:** I have utiltity as a 5% category. I paid a utility with PayPal bill pay, MyRewardsAccess.com says it's a utility, MyAccountAccess.com says it's a utility but only gave me 1% rewards. This is all from my current statement cycle, so I don't know what the end result is yet.

* I got the card in December 2022.
* Right after I got the card, I went to myrewardsaccess.com and selected ""Home Utilities"" and ""TV, Internet &amp; Streaming Services."" That is showing up on myrewardsaccess.com.
* Since I opened the card, I have made two transactions.
   * Each transaction was for $20.00
   * Each transaction was in the last week of 2022, so it took place during my current statement cycle which has not ended yet.
   * Transaction #1 was tagged as merchant category ""CABLE, SATELLITE AND OTHER PAY TV AND RADIO SERVICES"" on myaccountaccess.com.
   * Transaction #2 was tagged as merchant category ""UTILITIES-ELEC/GAS/HEATING OIL/SANITARY/WATER"" on myaccountaccess.com.
   * **Transaction #2 was made using PayPal bill pay.**
   * On myrewardsaccess.com, it says that I have $20.00 spent in the ""TV, Internet &amp; Streaming Services"" category and $20.00 spent in the ""Home Utilities"" category, as of November 30, 2022 (not sure why it says November 30, 2022).
      * On my rewardsaccess.com, it says I have $0.00 rewards available, I think because that spending is from the current period which is not over. That makes sense to me.

Based on the above, I would expect to have accrued 5% of $40.00 = $2.00 in rewards. However, the ""REWARDS &amp; BENEFITS"" section of myaccountaccess.com says that I have ""Rewards Earned Since Last Statement"" of $1.20. Suspiciously, that's what I would get if the PayPal Bill Pay transaction had been assigned to the 1% rewards category.

So:

* **Am I going to earn the 5% rewards on both transactions?**
* If not, is there anything I can do in order to earn the 5% rewards on both transactions (while still using PayPal Bill Pay)?

I feel cautiously optimistic that myrewardsaccess.com is right and myaccountaccess.com is wrong, for the following reasons:

* myrewardsaccess.com is where the rewards are actually redeemed.
* I've seen recent evidence (like [here](https://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Credit-Cards/Best-card-for-cash-back-paying-utility-bills/td-p/6534784/page/2)) that PayPal Bill Pay transactions are recognized correctly.
* Both myaccountaccess.com and myrewardsaccess.com assigned my PayPal Bill Pay transaction to the correct merchant code.
* The utility I paid is a major utility. (I'd prefer not to say which.)
* The program agreement on myrewardsaccess.com emphasizes that the rewards program is based on merchant category codes, and doesn't mention digital payments, bill pay services, third party payment services, PayPal, or anything like that as exceptions.

On the other hand,

* myaccountaccess.com seems more ""official"";
* myrewardsaccess.com seems a little janky since it says that my spending is as of November 30, 2022;
* I always expect things to go wrong with merchant code pass-through.",Elan Visa rewards: Anyone seen this before? (seemingly inconsistent information within the website),1673223447

6,personalfinance,"First, I’m not the one settling the trust, I’m someone that will inherit. The trustee/executor/whatever is a family member, but while they seem smart with this stuff… they’re also kinda lazy and have an open but also “don’t bug me attitude.” Example, if I have a legitimate question and call and ask them about it, they always make sure to say they’re busy doing something else (they’re retired so it’s always something like work on my property or run into town for something, that kind of “busy”) but will offer an answer, just not any details or explanation behind it.

The estate is comprised of this; the sale of a home that was owned free and clear (and lived in for 40+ years). A retirement account (I assume 401k held with Fidelity). Finally a checking savings account. There are multiple people that will inherit from this.

The house is being sold in a personal sale (all cash offer) and should be completed later this month (so 2023 tax year). The retirement account could have been liquidated in December, but the executor specifically said they wanted to wait until the new year so it will be handled this month as well. 

Doing my best reading I have been finding plenty of talk about when *someone* inherits a house and the tax basis being stepped up… also that if there are more than one person inheriting it then the taxes can be passed through to the recipients of the inheritance. However, when asking the executor if taxes will be our individual responsibility once we receive inheritance, he insists that won’t be the case and we’ll have zero taxes to worry about. (I am in a state that doesn’t specifically tax cash inheritance and it’s well below federal limits where taxes apply.)

The only think I can think of is this. Since it’s a *trust* and not just a will, he is able to legally act as if the deceased is the one selling the house and cashing out the retirement account. I assume in that case they will *not* get a step up basis on the value of the house, but will be exempt from $250k of profit due to it having been lived in for 40+ years. Past that excess profit from the house will be taxed at 2023 personal income rates. Same with the 401k. There will not be a 10% early withdrawal penalty since the person died well into their 90s, but it will be taxed at personal income rates. 

If that’s the case, I can’t figure out why they specifically wanted to wait till January to settle these items instead of quickly rushing in the final months of 2022 to get this done (probably would have been possible). Wouldn’t they now have to withhold some money from the proceeds to settle taxes in 2024 (2023 taxes due)? Or since this is from an estate and someone that died, are you able to submit a final tax return/taxes due any time mid year?

Again when I ask the executor just simplifies the answer as they’ll hold some amount to cover taxes and then be able to cut checks in a few weeks once the house sale closes (so likely early February, but almost certainly before the end of February).

That’s great since because of personal reasons I’m actually very eager for this inheritance… but also a little concerned that potentially an excess (large?) may be withheld to cover taxes and wouldn’t then be distributed to everyone as a second payment until spring *2024.*

Any guidance on if I’m understanding this correctly and if it’s processed like this then seriously it should just be as simply as a check in the mail without taxes that I need to worry about? If so… any speculation on why someone would specifically wait until a new calendar year when they had ~60 days and a cash buyer for the house ready within the first week…",Any advice on taxes when settling a trust/estate?,1673222361

19,personalfinance,"Hi all,

I'm about $13k in credit card debt. I want to start seriously paying it off. At the same time, I'm moving out of my now ex-boyfriend's place and won't have a car (I've been using his car up until now). 

The place I'm moving into next week is biking distance from my work, as well as from a grocery store and pharmacy. On the day-to-day, I won't strictly NEED a car, and if I do get a car, I'll save a ton on gas by biking instead. 

That said, not having a car sucks and leaves me dependent upon other people. My ex says I can still borrow his car and we'll go grocery shopping with it every Monday (we're remaining good friends), but what if he can't one week or the relationship sours for some reason? I'm going to be taking care of his cats while he's away for a week, and that would be quite the bike ride every dang day, there and back. Uber would cost me $20 there and back if I went that route. 

What do I do if it's raining? I live in Florida; in the summer months, it rains quite a lot. What if there's an emergency? I can't visit family, either. I have a cat I wouldn't be able to take to the vet without relying on someone else. Did I mention I'm 27 years old? I'm 27 years old and have NEVER had my own car.

I make $3k a month after taxes (just got my first salaried job in August!). My expenses, including minimum payments on cc debt, rent + utilities, and $100 per week in spending money, are about $1700. In a few months, I'll be moving into my own little studio instead of this room I'm about to rent (same landlord so he's cool with it), but even then, my expenses will still ""only"" be $2000 per month. That leaves me $1000 to work with. Enough for a car, but not a lot for car + debt payments. Oh, and I have no savings, either...

35,personalfinance,"I work in state government and have been fortunate to advance consistently over the last 5 years, going from about $70k/year to $90k/year, and just got bumped to $105k in January. My compensation includes a defined contribution plan (8% from me, 12% from employer), exemption from paying SSI, a ton of time off, and decently priced insurance. I also have a ton of autonomy and can do basically what I want, when I want. 

In my current role, I’m pretty much at the highest point I can expect to reach where I am. Growth (in title or salary) would require relocating my family (but would likely be $140k+ and in a lower cost of living location). From a work/life balance and job satisfaction standpoint, I’m kind of at the end of my rope, but that’s likely from my environment and not from the work itself. 

In Q3 (before I knew about the January pay increase), I was approached by a consulting firm. They are offering: 

- 90k
- fully remote 
- contribution to gym membership, better health insurance benefits, and some sort of educational benefit (still waiting on full details of these)
- 10% 401k contribution 
- comparable time off 
- not exempt from SSI (6.2% deduction I’m not currently paying)
- significant room for advancement, both inside the firm and elsewhere 

I was really excited to get this current pay increase and intend to funnel it all into maxing out my tax deferred retirement account and funding my spouse’s Roth IRA. We’re in our mid-30s and come from families that will never have the means to retire, so this felt big. 

Do I set myself back too much by essentially forfeiting my pay raise (thus, retirement contributions) and likely taking a $375-400/month net pay decrease to move into consulting? I think I have time over the next 30 years to recover from what will likely be a 3 year setback, but I don’t actually know that for certain.

I would like to understand the math behind whether it is better to save for retirement with Roth IRA contributions, or to pay down student loans.

I understand the financial and psychological benefits of doing each, and have an understanding of the time value of money, but am having trouble being able to compare these two, I feel like it should be straightforward depending on one's rates.

For example, where should the next $6,000 go if:

You have $100,000 in student debt at a 3.5% interest rate  
The stock market returns 7% on average  
You can invest money for the next 30 years and have not contributed any money to a Roth IRA yet

39,personalfinance,"This post might be lengthy because I want to give as much relevant context as possible and find advice that fits my specific needs. I'm not sure what the most accurate subreddit to post in, but I figure this one would have some valuable insight.

I grew up in a typical working class paycheck to paycheck situation. I had all of the necessities, but my parents didn't finish even high school. They never had a financial strategy, so they never planned for things like retirement and even house maintenance. The problem is the house is now 123 years old rowhome in a lower income, and less attractive area.

I grew up with many untreated many illnesses. I was never taken to get the help I needed because I grew up in an era where people didn't talk about it. When my dad died, it put my mom and me in poverty. I did the best I could manage the finances, but of course, I couldn't avoid debt completely.

I did go on to get professional help, go to school, and get a job. I make around $52k a year with a  likely 3-6% raise in March. I have the potential to earn at least around $100k at my current company in the next 5 years and maybe up to $200K if I leave. Right now, I do not want to leave because my company is great for my mental health and is very disability friendly. Obviously, I can only budget on my current income and not what it may be.

I did get into a bunch more debt because I couldn't cope when my mom died and developed a spending addiction. Right now, with my current budget, 2 of four credit cards will be paid off in 12 months. The other two could also probably be paid off between somewhere in 12-24 months. My car will be paid off on Aug 24 if I do not alter my payment schedule at all. One other debt will be paid in 24 months at the most. Basically, I'll be in significantly better shape 24 months from now and will be close to debt free if not debt free.

My big problem is my house. I inherited this old house that is in terrible shape. Just about everything needs updating or replaced, including the plumbing and electric. The roof, heating, and hot water heater were done recently. Literally, everything needs to go from carpeting, floors, windows, wallpaper, you name it. It doesn't help that my parents' decor choices were ugly and would be considered ugly on the market.  If I had unlimited funds and if it was possible (it is a rowhome afterall) I would demolish the house and start from scratch.

The house is obviously a problem and contributes to my  depression and anxiety. Ideally, I would like to move because this area is just depressing in general, but even a total makeover is better than nothing because at least everything is conveniently located from my house. Avoiding as much as debt as possible is nice, but ultimately, I would be okay with smart and carefully considered debt if it improves my life.

I'm a single person, but I think I would like to avoid apartment life largely due to being an introvert. I don't  want to deal with shitty landlords and the noise of neighbors. It is quieter where I live, but even more quiet would be nice. But there are advantages to apartment living, too.

I'm more looking at what my options might be in the 3-5 year range with such a shitty house. If I could waive a magic wand, I would move out tomorrow, but that is not realistic financially or emotional as I recover from my depression. 

I guess what I am wondering how do I deal with such a sorry house and where do I allocate my money in the future in regards to a home whether it is fixing this one up, buying a new one, getting an apartment?

***Card A*****:** $30,000 debt on it with a 20% APR

I transfer $10,000 from Card A to Card B with a balance transfer to pay less interest.

Now, I would have $20,000 charged on Card A and $10,000 charged on Card B with 0% interest.

In a case like this, what would be a better option to pay off my debt?

I am sharing with you my current financial situation in hopes of getting feedback on how well I'm managing my finances. Your criticism is welcome and any advice you are willing to share will be greatly appreciated.

Wife and I (both 34 years old) have a 2 year old kid. I'm currently the sole income earner, about $50k/yr. I've been living overseas close to 10 years (military) and the limited job opportunities for my spouse has left her jobless for the time being. 

We have no debt, but we also don't own much as far as household goods (we always look for rentals that are furnished, but we have our own bed sets). I am about 6 years from retirement and realistically, I have one more potential promotion.

So far, I've distributed my finances as followed:
€213k in foreign bank (at one point I was thinking of purchasing a property in Germany)
$170k in a dividend focused portfolio (Dividend earnings get reinvested but I don't contribute additional income).
$30k in I Bonds (one for each family member, currently accruing 9.62%). I plan on keeping these for 5 years to avoid paying any withdrawal penalties.
$93k in savings
$87k in Roth IRS (L cycle 2055). Max out every year at $22K contributions (TSP).
$12k in 2 old contributory IRAs ($6k each). (Waiting to hit 5 years to close these accounts)

2) How do HRA's typically work from the employer's perspective?  Do they buy these discounted debit cards for every employee upfront, and so the employer truly doesn't care how much each employee spends of the $4000 (if anything they'd probably want as much as possible so their employees feel like it's a good benefit)?  Or will the employer essentially get a bill each time an employee swipes their debit card?  In other words, depending on how it works, the employer may or may not be affected... As a new employee, I probably wouldn't want them to think I am taking advantage of them?

3) Will the employer even be able to see the expenses the employees submit?  i.e. would they see the specifics around what the bill is for and when it was incurred?  Or they would just see the employee submitting and the dollar amount?  I would think it may be a HIPAA violation to have too much information shared with them?",Question about HRA usage to get the most benefit,1673206933

Currently have a $3500 cc balance and $3800 remaining balance on the car loan, with the car needing some repairs and no disposable income.

The cc minimum monthly payment is $100/mo, which is all I can do.
Car minimum month payment is $200/mo at 6%int

Some personal loan quotes I've gotten for $4000 would have me paying around $150-175/mo, at a higher interest rate (29%) but the lower minimum payment would allow me to put more toward my cc as well as toward the work the car needs (it's not urgent, but it is neglected regular maintenance that I don't think I can safely put off for more than a few months). Or if I doubled the loan I could pay them both off and the loan payment would be around $260 (assuming I'm going for 60mo). The interest is steep but the monthly payments are my primary concern.

My question to this sub reddit is; what agreement would you suggest if you were either of us.

A couple of approaches we have thought of so far are;

1. We split the monthly mortgage payments 50:50, be he also pays be over a period of time half the deposit so we are eventually equally invested 
2. We 50:50 the mortgage payments, and when we come to move on and sell to find something else together, we split the equity, but I take out the value of half the deposit which would have been his deposit had he paid into it
3. I pay the mortgage 100% and he pays the bills 100%, but we then split the equity   
\- I'm personally less of a fan of this, as it doesn't guarantee fair input on both parts - just listing it as something we have thought of

When I first got off my parents insurance (it cost $200 a month for just my car) we saved and only paid like $200 a month for our two cars together. 
Then we moved to FL two years ago and it jumped to $250, understandable. Then last January another $50, so then it was $300 a month. And now here in October they jumped it to $366 ($30 being our renters which has never changed) a month. 

Full coverage. Two used cars. One paid off, the other nearly. No accidents for either of us ever, or tickets in the past two years that would drive the price up. I tried negotiating and they basically told me to kick rocks.

My current thinking is to take out a $75k home equity loan for 10 years and get a 6-7% interest rate.  (aprox $1500 payment which my salary can absorb).  I don't think it is a good idea to take the money out of investments while the market is so far down.

Credit Card One- Definitely would sue 
Credit Card Two- Less likely to sue but possibly 
Car- I really want it paid off as I’ll have an extra 200$ months when paid off 
Phone- Lowest Debt, will allow myself to have a break for a little bit and I’ll have an extra 30$ a month 
Apartment- Biggest debt, but the least likely to do anything legal

122,personalfinance,"Went to purchase a specific companies called ""katzkin's"" leather seats + install from a local large dealer. Called, toured the facility, picked out the leather I wanted. Went on the companies website with salesperson in the store for ""katzkin leather"" and chose the product. They told me they had a color scheme I did not want, or they could do the factory match option to my vehicle as well. I went with the factory match product. I asked three times in person that this was the same product I came for and toured, they said yes, just in 'factory match'. 

We agreed on the standard $1600+ tax installation for katzkin products. I dropped off the vehicle in the morning and when I got it, the quality seemed off, the color seemed off and the smell seemed off. It was nothing like what I had toured in the facility the prior day in terms of comfort, feel and finish. I was informed it was the same product I saw the day prior, just in a different color scheme. I was not happy but figured I just made a mistake and should not have gotten this done. I signed and paid an invoice with my chase CC. On the invoice it stated a long SKU number and nowhere did it mention the brand. I was handed my warranty papers for my 'katzkin' leather product. Upon arrival home, I called the company, katzkin, and told them about my disappointment with the product. They swore it did not add up, and insisted I give them the invoice info or take photos of the vehicle. Quickly, we discovered, I had a much cheaper competitors brand named 'roadwire' installed in my vehicle, not katzkin leather. I was informed the next day by the installer that they do 95% katzkin and consider them 'equal' so they did not need to inform me. I was apparently supposed to know this, even though I had no idea they even sold non katzkin products at this dealer, and I found them through the Katzkin website. That is what they had on hand and figured they could get away with installing it for the full katzkin price and intentionally never told me it was a different product altogether. 

They wanted me to pay more money to have the product I thought I was purchasing installed, or I had to use a kit in a different black color they had laying around if I didn't want an upcharge. They did not offer a full refund. They acted like they were doing me a favor even allowing me to get the product I thought I was paying for, and they even handed me the warranty papers for the product I thought I was buying, even though they installed a chinese branded competitors product in my vehicle, that I hate! The owner eventually agreed he would order me the product I wanted without charging me additional money if I left him a 5 star review, but it could take weeks to receive and install. I have decided to file a chargeback dispute. I don't want to want to wait weeks to have this resolved. I have a $50k brand new truck with leather I did not want, that is cheap and smells bad. They insist on removing the current installation and keeping the product as a part of the deal, but won't do that until the new product is in, which is going to be at minimum over a week, since it has to be custom ordered apparently. I am fed up and just wanted to make sure this sounds like a legitimate chargeback dispute? I have never charged back in my life and have many credit cards through chase, amex, discover, and a flawless credit history of 8 years. 

I would like to go to another local shop, have them remove this leather and put in the correct product that I thought i was purchasing. I have all of the evidence, including my warranty papers from KATZKIN, not Roadwire, just showing how deceptive and dishonest this installer was. 

Rant over, does this sound like a legitimate chargeback dispute? I am going on a road trip this upcoming weekend and do not have time to wait weeks for this to be resolved, and the current leather smells nauseating. I just don't want to get scammed out of this entire purchase and then have to pay another 1600 to have this done elsewhere when the current scamming place finds out I have filed a chargeback dispute.",First charge-back ever- received wrong product,1673198080

Hi everyone, first time poster here. I’ve recently started doing a good bit of math on my eventual retirement plan. I probably should have done this earlier, but it could be worse – I turn 37 in a few months, and my goal is to retire at 57. This conveniently gives me 20 years of growth before starting to draw from my retirement accounts. I’m a big spreadsheet guy (as I imagine most folks here are!) and I would really appreciate a few extra sets of eyes on a retirement spreadsheet I’ve been working on. The goal is to be able to play around with investment returns/inflation levels/contributions/etc. and see the long-term impact, while primarily letting me know if my goal (retire at 57) is realistic on my current trajectory.

Some assumptions:

\- Social Security will still be a thing (I’ve used the government’s own calculator to estimate what I’ll get in 2023 dollars)

\- My salary will increase by 2% each April until I retire

\- My 401(k) contributions will increase from the current 10% by 2% each May until they hit 20%

\- My company continues to match 6% of my annual contributions in a lump sum each February

\- I plan on drawing $5,000 (in 2023 dollars) each month until I hit 62, at which point I will draw $5,000 minus my social security benefit

Before I get to my question Id like to provide some back story. I saw an article from a newspaper from my home country that a physician (someone who immigrated to the US as a student, received his medical training in the US, and practices in the US), got married to someone who was still living in his home country. After their marriage he was able to bring her to the US.

However after some time years, she divorced him and took half of his assets and married someone else that she was truly in love with. The situation was described as essentially, she used him to get into the US and to get money and assets through the divorce (as her ""true love"" was described as being ""poor""). 

Of course we dont know the many smaller details of what happened, but this made me a little worried because unfortunately, cases like this are not unheard of in my country, and they especially burden men and women who are in high paid careers. I am nearing the end of my medical school training here in the US also, and in a few years, I plan to get married to someone from my country, and possibly someone who is still living there. 

So to ""protect"" myself from a situation like this, I am wondering what could be done. Would this help:

1. Once I begin my career, I deposit all of my income directly into my mother's account
2. I also use my mother as a ""proxy"" to buy all of the assets I will need (house, car, etc). This way, I am not an owner of these assets (instead, my mother is). So if there is a divorce, my spouse cannot claim those assets.

I am not concerned about transferring everything to my mother because we are very close. We have lived together all our life and I take care of her. It is very common for parents and children to live together their entire lives from where I come from.

I'm confused with Backdoor Roth and pro-rata rules.

I'm in a bit of uncertainty. So backstory, I was a fresh graduate and managed to land a job which pays fairly well.

Then I bought a gaming pc because i wanted it so bad, then i bought a new amp for myself. Now, at this point i could afford both of them comfortably because I had a roommate to share the bills and rent etc.

Then it all came crashing down. I HAD to move to my own place. But to afford it first, my sister offered to lend me money to use on the new house. Which is fine she doesnt push for payments or anything. I also have some credit card debt. And im also paying off my phone.

HOWEVER an oppurtunity showed up. My dad offered to buy my pc for 11.800 TL.

Im Turkish so lets do the math.

I make 7000 TL a month. Government forces for a raise next month. So my new monthly wage will be higher now.

Dad offers 11.800 TL for my PC.

I have 0 TL in savings.

The value on Form 8959 line 8 comes from Schedule SE line 6, and FreeTaxUSA brought it over just fine, but TurboTax doubled it, resulting in hundreds of dollars more in tax.

Here’s some background on me. Currently in my freshman year of college. I will end this academic year with ~26k of debt. I do not come from a well off family so I can’t rely heavily on large financial support from parents. Will begin working a part time campus job this semester.

Here’s my goal: I would like to build solid credit in college, financially well versed and begin start saving for my retirement from now.

- 10K cash
- 20K in I Bonds
- Annual compensation of 200K
- Monthly expenses of $2500-$3000 depending on fun money spending 
- High (ish) tax state

I pre-ordered a vehicle back when interest rates were about 2.5% from a credit union near me for a 5-7 year loan or 0% for a 3 year loan. 

My total sticker price is about 37K OTD. I'm not paying any markups. 

Right now, I'm just sharing/borrowing a car as needed (Specifics aren't important, but it isn't sustainable).

I was planning on grabbing a truck, and the market for used trucks is generally ridiculous. COVID has made that even worse - Buying new gets your dollar pretty far when 6 year old Tacoma's go for spitting distance of MSRP.

My plan was to get a low rate via my credit union (3%) and then stretch the payments over 7 years since that low of a rate means inflation effectively eats away at it.

However, rates are now 6.5% and I'm still waiting. So my truck will end up being not 37K, but 46K or so at these interest rates. 

My questions are two-fold:

1. Does it no longer make sense to put the minimum down and stretch payments (Rephrased - Should I basically try to save up cash and pay all cash?)
2. Does it no longer make sense to buy this truck new and instead find an old 04 Tacoma for $10,000 or something instead? 

Related to #2 - Initially, I leaned into the base model at about 27K, but when I realized the payment increase to get all the tech/trim upgrades I wanted was only $100/mo more, it was pretty easy to upgrade. I'm the type of person to keep a vehicle for as long as it'll live, so I do still think it's worth it, but all cash makes it hurt more I suppose (Relative to an old beater Taco).",Buying a new vehicle (Pre-Ordered) - Rates making me squirmish,1673165882

Monthly payment = $500

To aggressively tackle this debt we recently sold items and just received $20,000. We have $5000 set aside for emergencies but have a goal of $10,000. We also bought a house last year, and got married, so may get a decent sized tax refund in a few months. 

What I’m wondering is how to proceed… 

Should I pay off the two smaller cards (1 and 3) so that we can eliminate two monthly payments and free up that monthly money? Or should I pay off card 1 and partially card 2 since they have the highest interest rates even though that would leave me with two credit card payments a month instead of one payment like the first option? Psychologically paying off two cards would feel better but that is probably just Dave Ramsey in my ear…

Then there is the remaining debt:
I thought if I go ahead and pay off some of this, then my credit will look better and so I could possibly transfer the remaining balance to a zero interest card in another month and continue making payments aggressively until it’s gone.
Or I could apply for a HELOC to cover the remaining debt?
Or I could just leave it as is, not have any more credit inquiries, and just put the extra monthly payments I freed up towards it and hope that our tax refund can help finish it off?

Credit score was 700 when I was denied a credit card consolidation loan 3 months ago which spurred the selling. 

I also wonder if we should take some out of the emergency fund but I know my partner feels very uncomfortable with how little savings we already have. He would rather use the $20,000 to put half in savings and half toward the debt.

I took some personal loans this year to help me have some liquidity while I diversified investments into bonds and stocks.

(Also, I'm a highly regarded individual as I bought LEAPs instead of stocks. Just as we're entering a recession... yay!)

I'm also being pressured by my significant other to set aside funds to pay off the remainder of our lesser mortgage (only about $40k left) so we can finally get it out of the way. While not advisable financially, it serves as a good backup in case anything ever happens to me, so I'm OK with this plan.

Only problem is if I pay off the mortgage, I'll drain $40k out of my bank account, and then still have $3k / mo in personal loan payments.

219,personalfinance,"I was given advice to ask in the planning section of this sub as talking to a personal finance advisor may be another alternative to a lawyer in creating a trust. My post and details from r(/)legal advice below

(NC) So I’m gonna condense this the best I can, I’m looking into possibly creating a trust that will allow me to set away money earned from an insurance settlement for the future (say anywhere between 3-5 years at minimum?) and I’m hoping to do so in a way that it isn’t counted against me when attempting to apply for EBT and Medicaid for myself as an adult.

I lost my mother to cancer 2 months ago and until that point we were a household together and I was under her as a full time student. I’m 20 years old but can’t drive, only income is from my pell grant refunds from school (at best 2.5k max) and occasional internet surveys or like odd Amazon card awards for survey participation like $5-$10 no more than like,, $200 tops a year from that.

The insurance settlement I received was from one of my grandparent’s insurance companies when I lost that loved one in a car accident 4 years ago. I was a backseat passenger and got damages for physical and emotional ones. It was collected at the last possible second with my Mom really facilitating that process and now that she’s gone and I’m forced to take hold of this myself because no one else in the family has the experience with this (the other grandparent I live with who took my Ma and I in is claiming she owes him rent and utilities when she verbally wanted to pay rent and utilities to lessen his burden but he also said to her not to worry about the utilities). He also so far to start is not keen on putting in writing how much I owe to him on say rent or utilities because he doesn’t want to pay taxes if these arrangements are finalized so I’m stressed out but I hope he’ll warm up to it with time

I know for a fact having a little over 20k in the bank won’t let me be eligible for programs like my mom was and I’m scared to be without insurance and transport benefits from that insurance. I won’t be in drivers Ed until February and want to be smart with the money that’s left to me so I’m going to attempt the trust route. I am trying to be optimistic but unsure what trusts if any beyond special needs trusts aren’t counted as like liquid assets.

If I’m seeking a personal finance advisor, is there something specific I should search for or any advice here if anyone has been in anything similar?

For context I am a married 27M, no kids, 200-250K HHI, living in a LCOL. We already maximize 401k / IRA contributions and have an emergency fund established. 

The loans are as follows:

1. 5k outstanding 401k loan. My understanding is there is no “cost” to this loan since I pay interest to myself, and the only “cost” is the fact that the loan amount is not growing over time

2. 7k left on car, 3.5%

3. 200k mortgage, 3.25%. We pay ~$400 a month in PMI, so to me it makes sense to prioritize reaching a 20% equity threshold to get the PMI removed. The logic being that’s a guaranteed $400/month return. I have considered taking out a 401k loan and using that to reach the threshold - is that a good idea?

4. Alternatively, we could just invest in equities under the assumption that the 7% return outweighs the cost of the loans, but I strongly value being debt free.

\-Electric and wifi (I WFH so necessary): ranges up to $160

\-Pet insurance: $350 (horrible I know, but non negotiable)

\-Debt management payment: $500 (I have gotten on a debt management plan and am to pay this amount)

\-Chase credit cards: $200 (This part is frustrating - My debt management plan initially reached out to Chase about the plan on 11/16. Chase responded requesting increasing the amount I pay, which I agreed to. They have yet to accept the plan, so in the meantime I am paying part of my minimum payment through my debt management plan, and then the rest out of pocket.

\-Affirm: $50 (This one is at 0%)

\-Pet food: $200

\-Medication: $140

I have a debt management plan with Apprisen, where I pay $500 a month. My debt total is $20,000 on that plan (literally makes me nauseous thinking about it).

I have a Care Credit card not on my debt management plan. It has a balance of $1620 on it. I have a promotional purchase set to expire in 2 weeks, so will be paying off $500 of that so I don't end up being charged APR for that purchase at least. After that my balance will be around $1100 at 26.99%.

My Apple Card does not fall under the debt management plan, and has a balance of $1700 at 26.24%.

I have a $350 balance with Affirm at 0%.

I do not have a car, and I take public transit to work. I am working on cutting back the amount I spend on groceries significantly. I also owe a family member $10k, but as long as I contribute to that each month, I won't be charged any interest. I just started my new job, and haven't been paid yet so I don't know my take home. My first paycheck will have to go to February rent and getting that promotional purchase on my CareCredit card paid off so I don't get charged interest on it.

I have a teaching credential so I am hoping to find tutoring clients - I have posted on neighborhood sites and applied to online tutoring platforms. If that doesn't work out, I will find something else. I can't do most gig work because I don't have a car.

I feel totally overwhelmed and frankly sick thinking about how I am going to dig myself out of this hole.

254,personalfinance,"29(f) Thought I'd post this here because home ownership has been on my mind a lot lately and I keep kicking myself every once in awhile for possibly missing an opportunity.

About 5 years ago, my dad offered to help me with the down payment on a house (about $5,000) if I could match it. At the time of his offer, I kept changing jobs a lot, and my income was never really stable since my focus was finding a job I liked enough to stay at. 

My Dad constantly berates me for not taking him up on the offer. He really wanted me to take his advice and buy a house using my step-mom as my realtor. My Dad is always pressuring me to buy a house to rent out the additional rooms.

 He recently made his offer again, and then withdrew any future offers of helping me.

I would've loved to accept but, I just never saw it as a responsible decision because:

1) The down payment would have been from most of my savings. 

2) My salary is better than it was 5 years ago but I'm still working on getting a better paid position. I'm single, so only 1 income to survive on and I'm barely scraping by as is.

3) After having roommates for so many years, I really want my own space when I do decide to buy. Plus relying on others financially really bothers me.

I haven't got my first paycheck yet but I want to go ahead and set up all my accounts and things now so I know it's set. My general theory is that I'll take out a few hundred a month, give or take, for spending money (not spending recklessly, things like maintenance for my car, gas, etc) and a small ""rainy day jar"" of sorts to save for a trip to visit family I'd like to take. The rest I want to put into savings, as high a yield as possible and as something I won't frequently withdraw from. My initial thought was just a HYSA, but I've seen a Roth IRA as another option. I've also always had an interest in the stock market and investing and would probably like to invest a small chunk of that savings on my own- a small percentage so that I'm not risking it all but enough where I can flexibly do some trading in stable stocks and ETFs and such.

&amp;#x200B;

15% - spending money for car maintenance, gas, and bills (don't have many)

10% - short-term savings for a trip to visit family

75% - savings of some sort, what I need is advice on how to split this up; all in Roth IRA, all in HYSA, a CD, stocks, some combination, or something else entirely?

I am 55, lost my life savings to medical debt in my 40s. Have always worked, love my trade, but around that time when I was rebuilding, the pandemic hit. I put my career on hold to care for my mother who became critically ill. I don't regret that decision one bit, she was a helluva woman that sacrificed for everyone her entire life, but caregiving wipes you out in every way possible, mentally, financially, emotionally.

I can stay in the house (needs about 4k on the plumbing work and eventually a roof which has been replaced once).

I have no debt, truck is paid off so my expenses are $1700 a month. It's insane, I have never had such low expenses. 

But a lot of my friends tell me it would make more sense for me to move out into a smaller place and sell it before the Phoenix market crashes or the house otherwise starts sinking in value. Buddy last night said it always makes sense to take cash. ""No brainer"".

Rent is atrocious in Phoenix so I could buy somewhere smaller and, I assume make a profit but I will just turn around and have to buy again.

I am a district manager for a company and manage 8 gas stations in California. One of them is across the street from a Safeway gas station.

The company I work for, all 50 of our stations, if a customer pays inside or outside with card, they will only get charged what they pump, if they put $60 on a pump (paying inside via card) and pump only $40, they only get charged $40. It’s all automatic.

This sAfeway gas station in particular in my opinion is ripping  people off:

I went there and put money on the pump (paying inside) with a card, didn’t use it all , and it didn’t reimburse me the difference. I had lost one of my two receipts and had to go back, and go to the customer service in the main Safeway and find out that tons of envelopes of money get taken to customer service with peoples change. Eventually they gave me back my $40 I had left behind ($20 on 12/30/22 and $20 on 1/3/23).

The lady at Safeway reassured me this is an issue that it doesn’t get reimbursed the difference but if you PAY OUTSIDE WITH A CARD, YOU WILL ONLY GET CHARGED WHAT YOU PUMP. Today I proved that is incorrect. 

Fast forward to today 1/7/23 I pay outside with my credit card and put $37.50 gas in my car. The receipt didn’t come out so I go inside, as soon as I go inside he says change on pump 3 and hands me 2.50 and my receipt. I confirmed he’s talking about my pump and am very alarmed this is how they process card transactions.

The receipt says $40 paid and 37.50 pumped so to give me 2.50 change. My problem with this is the pump didn’t tell me to go inside and get my change. 

I went back into Safeway and told the lady working in Safeway  what was going on and she was surprised.

Basically tons of people are overpaying for gas. 

Who can I contact about this? I assure you this is not how they should be running people’s cards and my 1 star yelp review is not going to cut it. People are not even noticing they are over paying. Can I call some organization and tell them and they force them to fix their system? This isn’t sitting right with me.

300,personalfinance,"Hi everyone,

I'll be moving to the US (from the UK) in a week and am looking at various options and how banking works there.

Maybe my understanding is a bit rusty, but in the UK we have debit accounts which I imagine is the equivalent of a checkings account?

I thought the best idea is that my wife and I get a joint checkings account where work can pay us into and then separate savings accounts (she already has one).

I've been reading online that Charles Schwab is very good for checkings, but they don't seem to have an option of a joint one?

What suggestions do you guys have?

For savings I was thinking of going with a credit union as it seems they are better rated than regular banks - any suggestions for those?

Here in the UK I tend to pay bills via direct debits from my debit account and everything else via a cashback credit card that I pay off each month in full. I imagine same principle applies in the US?

Would my UK credit rating (very good) count for anything in the US when opening cards? I was thinking of getting an AMEX and maybe Amazon credit card. Any suggestions for other ones?

Regarding money transfer, it seems Wise, which I already have, is the best option?

Right now I’m at 10k in savings at Chase which gives me like 0.01% interest which isn’t much. I recently heard about Marcus by Goldman Sachs, Enzo, Cap one savings, even Amex savings acc.

I currently own a 2005 Hyundai Elantra (reliable as all can be but oh well) and a 1983 Nissan/Datsun 720 pickup. Ideally, anything with 4 doors and low miles. She’s already got the rig of her dreams (2023 Buick Encore GX @ $500 a month smh). Well, we are already strapped for cash more often than not, and with a baby in the picture, I can’t see it getting any better. My plan was to sell both of my beaters and use that as a down payment for something newer and nicer. I’m thinking 2010-2015 vehicles. I want to spend no more than $10k. That is my number. Well earlier I came across a really clean example of a 2004.5 VW Jetta GLI. While not a “new” vehicle, it’s got 80k miles and they want $7k for it. I could buy that with cash. Now I know I could probably find something newer, but I love this generation and trim of Jetta. 4 door, looks good, manual, great on fuel, and safe. Well of course she doesn’t like the idea of this. Told me “you want something that is 2015-2020 and low miles”. But alas, we are already paying $500 a month for your mommy mobile, and probably shouldn’t be financing another vehicle. Why not live within our means and buy a mid 2000’s vehicle with low miles with cash? Or better yet, sell my Datsun and clean up my Hyundai a little. She grew up in a very rich household, and I did not, so we always see things a little differently. Yes, something newer would be nice and safe and probably last longer. No, my 2005 Hyundai Elantra isn’t going to blow up on me anytime soon (knock on wood) and is plenty reliable and good on gas.

The fraud alert is advertised as free for a year and will 'recommend or require' (a little vague) whoever does the inquiry to contact you.  There are different tiers for this - the free for a year option is for people who suspect suspicious activity (vs confirmed identity theft).

After the adjuster came, the home insurance company (Progressive) sent me a letter saying I am required to get a licensed contractor to sign off mold remediation before they will renew my home insurance policy.

I'm at the very beginning of a 30 year mortgage on a house.  We closed in November of last year, and our first mortgage payment was Jan 1st 2023.

By a stroke of luck, my new job will most likely allow me to pay down the entire principal of the loan by the end of this calendar year, or early 2024, and still be able to have enough in savings and retirement to not leave us cash poor.

&amp;#x200B;

My big question here:  What is the advice for paying off the mortgage in its entirety, owning the home outright, and being done with my relationship with this lender ASAP (I am not a fan of them)?  Is it as simple as paying off the remaining balance of the principal and then I own the home and can close out my mortgage?  Do I need to refinance or restructure?  There's no prepayment penalty as you can see.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I can pay off my 30 year mortgage in the next year or so, how to be rid of this lender, owe them no more money, and own my home outright?

I'm a UK-born citizen but very recently moved to Krakow, Poland.

I run my own business (previously in the UK - although it's completely online) but due to Polish immigration troubles I've had to register this business through an incubator company here in Poland.

Now my clients must pay my salary directly to the incubator company so it exchanges from GBP to ZL. The incubator company then deducts taxes and I'm then paid by them in ZL.

I'm aware that being paid in GBP would be much better but unfortunately it is currently impossible in my circumstances. However, I'm wondering how best to handle my situation...

I am only 28 year old so I am trying to save money each month from my salary but I'm not sure if it's better to keep it in ZL or transfer it out to my UK account into GBP? And whether it's best to do this as soon as I receive my salary, or some other specified date? On a monthly basis or yearly one?

At the moment, I'm just leaving the savings in my Polish bank account but would like to start being more proactive about it. I feel like it would be better to have the savings in GBP but then I would also be hit with an exchange rate that may not be favourable...

358,personalfinance,"Hey folks, re-did my budget for the new year and I'm not sure what to do with about $1000 a month surplus I have. Here's where we are at:

1) Emergency fund $10,000 - this is low compared to our expenses, but my wife and I have very secure jobs, a portion of our income is rental income (so we would have coverage even if we got fired), we have some assets that we could liquidate pretty quickly, and if all else fails, we have some safety nets in terms of our family. Still, the right answer might be to keep saving until we hit a higher number.

2) We both max out our Roth IRAs (VFIFX)

3) I contribute 6% to a 401K (the most my work matches)

4) We have no credit card debt

5) Our home mortgage is 3% and we currently don't contribute extra

6) Our rental property mortgage is 3.6% and we don't contribue extra

7) We both have student loans totalling about $28k, ranging from 2.5% to 6% (payments are paused and the total amount would be forgiven if that ends up actually happening)

8) Only other debt is our cars. She owes $2500 at 2.9% and I owe $6800 at 3%

So we can either keep saving to hit a higher emergency fund ($20k?), start paying our highest interest debt (but they are student loans, so we're in wait-and-see mode), pay off the cars, pay down the mortgage, or invest in something else.

Hello, and thanks for reading. I’ve been researching this, but all the options are overwhelming and I’d love personal advice from people who have been here.

My situation is that I can pay my bills, but I have very little left over for…anything. One emergency or job loss and I’d be screwed. I can’t stand knowing I have this much debt, and the payments are barely manageable.

I’m not behind on any payments. My credit was good, but has dropped because of the utilization. It’s probably a 650-675 now. I have a mortgage on my home and no car payments. No student loans, no significant medical bills. No bankruptcy in my past.

I currently owe about $13,500 in credit card debt and one personal loan at my bank. My payments on all that is about a total of $365. I’d love to lower that, but I understand the irony is that I need to dramatically increase it. I’d like to find a middle ground. It would be easier to pay with a light at the end of the tunnel.

I’m looking at options for help. I keep seeing that debt settlement is awful and risky, but I just saw another post where someone in a similar position to mine was told that it might not be bad for him. How badly does it tank your credit? What is the likelihood of being sued? Will the creditors never give me a card again? Will my credit union cancel my accounts? Take my pay?

I would really hesitate to file bankruptcy. I’ve worked in financial agencies where that would deter us from hiring prospective applicants. I just really want to avoid something that could permanently be attached to my name in a negative light. 

Also, I’ve heard that medical bills can no longer be reported to credit agencies. Is that true?

She is 38 years old, in the middle of a contentious divorce. It does look like it will be a clean split financially. However, the divorce is semi-relevant because there will likely be unforeseen lawyer expenses not included in what I’ve provided below. She experienced a manic episode trigged by the divorce which lead to accruing a majority of this debt in the span of 2 months. She has sought treatment, has been provided medication and the mania has been resolved. She has always been VERY financially frugal - I've never seen anything like this happen to her before. 

She currently works a full time and part time job to try and keep her head above water – but this isn’t viable for much longer as she is also now a single parent to a 2 year old daughter.

We have really cut down on a LOT of her bills – she is going to be surrendering her 2 cats, I have told her she needs to either return her vehicle or sell it and just pay off the difference in the loan and get a cheap used car. I have recommended she return her pelaton (not sure if eligible for return). The HVAC unit is not eligible for return. There are not a lot of items that are available from the debt for selling to supplement income. 

Right now the only paths I see forward for her are: 

1. Rent both rooms (probably $1000 income a month could come of this) but it’s risky because she also has a young child in the home and a co-parent using every possible reason to try and revoke custody. Still will not cover total cost of bills. Will have to prioritize payments of bills (some will not be paid).

2. Sell her home – place all equity toward debts – unable to do so until divorce is finalized and might take a while. Start over after that. Bills would go unpaid until this would be able to happen. Possible this will not cover all debts. 

3. Foreclosure (can’t happen until divorce is finalized) – I feel like this should be the LAST thing she considers, but she’d rather do this instead of sell her home. Her mortgage is significantly less than rent in our area. 

I can tell you, at this point, she is unable to negotiate the bills herself … I would be willing to help out if I feel confident in what I’m saying but I’ve never needed to do that before. Would totally take recommendations. 

Are there other options that I’m missing? And what bills COULD be sent to collections, if it becomes a situation in which she picks and chooses which bills pays? Does the chase consolidation make sense in this case?

TLDR: To sum it up, in our situation, would you invest an extra 30-40k per year to save for rental real estate or max our Mega Backdoor Roth?

We want to buy our first rental property in 3-5 years using money I save from my business. We’re wondering if this would then put us too real-estate heavy in our portfolio. The alternative would be to max out the Mega Backdoor Roth instead but we can’t do both. 

Quick run-down:
40s couple, 1 kid 
400k in retirement vehicles (401k, IRAs)
350k primary residence (mortgage-free)
25k Emergency fund 
529 fully funded for kid (combo grandparents and our lump sum contribution)

We realize our situation isn’t typical and we have had fortunate circumstances in order to have a high saving’s rate. We will save the following yearly regardless of the decision to do Mega or Rental:
Roth 401k (19,500 plus employer match)
Backdoor Roth’s x 2 (13,000)
HSA family (7,300)
Total ~39,800/year plus employer match

Now onto the question. I’ll have around an extra 30-40k/year to allocate. We’ve talked about piling up cash to potentially get a long-term rental property (~300k value) up where our family is from. But we’re worried this will skew us too real estate heavy even though our primary residence isn’t income producing like the rental would be. Rental property is something we want to do so it’s more of a now vs later question.

When I was young I was terrified of student loan debt, to the point where I refused to take out any and went to community college and was able to pay out of pocket. I finished my BA with only about $14,000 in student loans. I use the income from my part time job to make payments on the loans. 

The downside is that I cashed out my 401(k) twice to pay for my tuition out of pocket before I had to take out student loans. (I cashed it out upon leaving my first job, then when I left my second job I cashed out what I'd accrued in my 401(k) there, if that makes sense.) I know that sounds incredibly stupid. When I was in my 20's I actually believed that I'd just keep working for the rest of my life and never retire. I learned later that not only would health problems take me out of the job market, but employers rarely let employees stay after they hit a certain age.

For my 18th birthday, I received a savings account from my grandparents, into which they had paid €50 monthly for many years. It was well over €10,000 when I received access to it. My grandpa told me he’d keep the monthly payments up until I touch the account, which I subsequently haven’t done. My grandparents have five grandchildren, myself, my two brothers and two cousins. I’m the oldest. So far, only I and one of my brothers have turned 18 and received such a savings account. 

Today, my grandparents told my brothers and myself that, since they don’t know if they’ll live to see all of my cousins and siblings turn 18 (my grandma certainly won’t, since she has terminal cancer and my youngest brother is 12 years old), they would stop doing the payments as of right now and have just filled all accounts up to €20,000. My brother and I now have unconditional access to that entire sum in each of our accounts. 

In addition, I have a great-grandma. She is 100 years old and currently in the process of dying. It’s sad, but we saw it coming and she had a remarkable life. 
About a year ago, she decided do gift all of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren €5000 each. She had a joint will with her husband, my great-grandpa, who died 14 years ago. He hasn’t even met all of his great-grandchildren, and now she can’t alter the will, so she gifted each of us €5000 while she is still alive.

Because of the limited nature of my plan, I've been in cash for the last 2 years but I'm considering putting some back to work and I would like to put some into Treasuries as I try to time the peak in interest rates (I'm not here for that debate).

490,personalfinance,"Hello all, thanks in advance for your help!

Thanks to a raise this past year, my 2023 MAGI will be flirting, if not over, the income limits for contributing directly to a Roth IRA. To be safe, I'd rather just contribute via backdoor then have to worry about removing excess contributions if my wife and I (filing jointly) hit the $218-228K limit.

Are there any benefits to contributing directly to a Roth IRA with after-tax dollars vs going the backdoor route (other than simplicity)?

Our complication is that my wife already has a rollover IRA from a 403b of a previous employer. The full amount of the IRA is funded with pre-tax dollars. When doing a backdoor Roth contribution, my understanding is that the pro-rata rule applies. There is no way to rollover *only* after-tax dollars and therefore avoid taxes.

The current balance of her Rollover IRA is around $40k. 

So here is my understanding of what will happen:

1. We contribute $6500 to my wife's traditional IRA with *after-tax* dollars.

According to the pro-rata rule: `$40k + $6.5k = $46.5k` (new balance) consisting of 86% before-tax dollars (`$40k / $46.5k`) and 14% after-tax dollars (`$6.5k / $46.5k`).

2. We initiate a conversion from the IRA to her Roth IRA for $6.5k.

Since 86% of the conversion dollars are before-tax, the tax base of the conversion would be around $5.5k (`6.5k * 86%`).

3. Come 2024 tax time, that $5.5k shows up as income.

Before starting the process, I'd love to know what to expect. Could someone confirm my understanding, or point out where I am misunderstanding.

I had tooth extractions done in 2021 and the bill went through collections. I found out about this months after the procedure. Fortunately, my insurance worked with me so they can pay their share, but I had to pay the full bill first to prevent further accrual of interest.

The checks sent by me and my insurance  have been cleared or cashed out by the collections agency and my dentist. I’ve  the proof of payment letter from collections and confirmed with my insurance that the check they mailed to my dentist has been cleared.

With that step done, I recently called my dentist to request a refund but was told they would wait to hear from collections (unfortunately the proof of payment letter that I faxed to them was not enough). I also called the agency and asked them to inform my dentist that I’ve paid my bill but I was told I must wait because there’s a process and it could take until February.

525,personalfinance,"The interest one earns each year on your investment is important, but what is equally as important is how much you put in as your initial investment. I did the math on three different scenarios where one scenario is having a nice fat initial invesment, the other where you start with nothing and have a constant input on your invesment,  and the last one where you have both. In this test, you will have the same numbers like the length you will keep your investment : 20 years and the interest rate : 10%. 

1st scenario:       $20,000 initial investment 
Monthly contribution:       $0
Length of investment:      20 years
Interest rate:      10% 
Compound frequency:      Anually
AFTER 20 YEARS:     $134,350
Total out of pocket cost after 20 years:     $20,000

2nd scenario:       $0 initial investment 
Monthly contribution:       $250
Length of investment:      20 years
Interest rate:      10% 
Compound frequency:      Anually
AFTER 20 YEARS:     $172,825

Compound frequency:      Anually
AFTER 20 YEARS:     $306,375
Total out of pocket cost after 20 years:     $80,000


Not very one has 20k extra to invest right away but the idea is that initial investment is huge considering its about as good as someone investing a smaller amount for about 20 years, plus in the long run, it costs less 20k vs 60k. If you can do both, do it. It'd clearly shows its worth it. If you have a strong diversified portfolio, like 65% etfs, 25% blue chip stocks, 10% crypto you can definitely push higher than 10% anually. Imo. The difference between 10% and 15% in the long run is huge.
Let's keep the same scenarions and numbers but this time let's change the interest rate from 10% to 15%

1st scenario:       $20,000 initial investment 
Monthly contribution:       $0
Length of investment:      20 years
Interest rate:      15% 
Compound frequency:      Anually
AFTER 20 YEARS:     $327,330
Total out of pocket cost after 20 years:     $20,000

2nd scenario:       $0 initial investment 
Monthly contribution:       $250
Length of investment:      20 years
Interest rate:      15%

In there several commenters make note that they would not want to have 2 vehicles financed at the same time. That got me thinking about finishing paying off Wife's car before replacing mine. That loan is 2.99%. (However if a new loan is significantly higher rate, I am better saving the money to buy that down...). 

BUT...the **real question here**, what came into my thoughts and would like to discuss, in todays choppy, down market times...is it finally worth aggressively paying down debt that is at 3% or below? Typically I would get great loan rates, so I have never parted with a large lump sum (cars under 10k, yes) on a major purchase unless required such as a home down payment. I have long felt that investing the money was the better way. 

Is it worth locking in the 3% return and accelerating payments to that loan, or leave it alone and keep investing planned amounts even in down market? I do understand I am buying ""more"" if the market declines, but is it worth buying ""certainty"" at 3%.  And further...even if I do outright own that car sooner, is that buying me additional value or utility? Do I pay my wifes car off in a lump sum payment (13k) and just ear mark the car payment amount as an increase towards investing goals regardless of if market goes up or down in future?

I make 125k a year.

Have about 10k in student loan debt. 

Car payed off.

Have 40k saved for a down payment.

Also have about 140k in my 401k.

I want to buy my first home I’ve been renting for the past 5 years now. I currently moved back in with my parents to save money and save for my down payment. I’m ready to go and by my own home now.

The problem is that most of the houses in my city are around 350k+ if I want to live in an average nice home and good neighborhood. I’ve looked up houses that are around 200k-300k and they need major repairs done. Some of the houses in that price range looked almost trashed from the inside. I would have to make major repairs and maybe not live in such a good area.

I knows there’s a lot of controversy surrounding Dave Ramsey but he always suggests to get a 15 year fixed mortgage rate loan. 

With a 15 year rate loan that puts me at around 270k for a home. The houses around here for that price are mostly fixer uppers. With a 30 year loan I’m at around 340k for a home which I can find a nice home here with that price.

I want to live here in my hometown for a long time.

I’m not sure what to do. Keep renting and save up more money for a bigger down payment? Go for the 30 year fixed rate mortgage loans and try to get some roommates to help me pay it off? Buy a fixer upper keep living in my parents house and work towards fixing it up.

555,personalfinance,"Hi all,

I'm looking into increasing my cash on hand at the end of the month after paying off my bills. I been locked down for 2 years paying off the accumulated debt I had since I was 18 making dumb purchases while broke. It got out of control during 2020 and finally I woke up right before getting close to a disaster. I cracked open excel and busted out an allocation budget for me to follow through. I got an understanding of what I was spending on and what BS needs to be cut out. From there I poured what I could to pay down debts and starting with 58k debt with 8 accounts I'm now down to 33k with 3 cards.

This worked the first year but last year I ran into problems being cutthroat with my budget and couple events set me back for a few months cause I didn't had enough in my bank account. I'm starting off better this year after some fat pay raises but with the accounts I got left the minimum payments are too high for me to attempt to pay off either one without putting myself in the same position again. 

Currently I'm making payments total of $1100 per month towards my 3 cards, each with about 10-12K balances and APRs around 24%. With my credit score I'm looking at loans with 11-14% APR for 5 years, not the greatest but that drops my payment down to $700-770 per month and save a lot on interest. So far I hit up some of the debt companies like LendingClub and Upstart but I'm trying to see if any of the local CUs might work with me, my current CU denied me last year saying it was too much.

My goal is with the extra money I should have $1000+ end of the month left to save to my bank account. I got 2k in the bank right now I'm aiming for at least 12k by the end of the year. Once there I can increase payments on the loan to pay it off further and be closer to freedom.

Got 2 newbie questions...

1. I currently already max out the 401k my employer provides and I also have a Roth IRA account on Fidelity. I wonder if I'm also able to get another tax deferred IRA on my own. By tax deferred I mean you don't get taxed on it now, only when you withdraw after retirement, just like 401k.
2. I haven't contributed anything to HSA but I'm thinking about it. My original rationale is that I live a healthy lifestyle so I probably won't have much health related expenses. I also misunderstood it, thinking one can only use HSA funds for health related things. But now I learned that  you can also use HSA funds for non-health related things. This got me wondering, then wouldn't the money I put into a HSA now sort of act like an additional contribution like the 401k? As I understand, **after age 65,** one can use the HSA funds for non-health related things, it just has to be taxed like a 401k withdraw, but there's **no additional** penalties. So if I want to maximize my tax deferred retirement savings, I should contribute to a HSA as well.

Please advise.

569,personalfinance,"This isn't to hate on either of these firms, I've been with both for years. But getting more advanced in my finances they're both starting to show their cracks, and I've had a pretty bad experience as of late.

**Wealthfront:**

I recently decided to do a Non deductible IRA to Roth IRA conversion. I had to rollover some money to make this happen and Wealthfront has no option for you to hold your money in cash and do the rollover, so interday gains/losses make the numbers only loosely accurate and you have to account for the actual dollar amount of things after the transfers happen. Not a deal breaker but it did make it so I do all of my IRAs in Schwab now where they have a lot of fine grained controls for me to move things around. 

I've also learned Wealthfront has to do a lot of things manually as their system doesn't support certain transfers and it leaves a lot of room for error, leading to the below...

I recently requested an account transfer of my Roth IRA from Wealthfront to my Schwab account. They totally botched it and only sent 1/3 of my shares and their web UI has removed my Roth IRA so I can't even go and see what my account was before I initiated the transfer. I was luckily able to grab a statement that was generated to show the initial amount but this is appallingly bad that they would mess this up.

All this to say Wealthfront is **REALLY** lacking if you are doing anything outside of using their default options for investing and letting the robo advisor do it's thing, and make sure to double check anything as they can make very major mistakes.

**M1 Finance:**

I used their Borrow feature recently when I needed a couple grand immediately and I was a couple days from my next paycheck. I have no problem with getting the money, but they have an extremely poor payback system. I borrowed $1k, paid it back 2 days later. And then a couple weeks later the interest charge showed up. There's no notification to be able to pay the interest early, and no notification when the amount showed up. Since I didn't pay the interest the same day, they charged me interest on the interest. 

In the end it was less than $1 extra, but that's not my issue, it's more so highlighting that these new brokers, while innovating, still have a lot of problems behind the scenes. And you never know when something may break on you or be incorrect so stay diligent.

**Conclusion:**

I have since moved out of both of them altogether for my investments (still using Wealthfronts HYSA as I am a big fan of that) and have been very happy with using Schwab for all of my investing needs.

Was I crazy for doing this? Do I have any options, or do I just ride it out for the loan and enjoy the newer vehicle? To ellaborate, my take home is just over $4,000 a month and after all of my bills, I'm left with about $560 which I use to max out my ROTH IRA. I do expect my income to rise in the next year. 

I think my only reservations to this purchase is that I was really wanting to go electric for my next vehicle, and was willing to wait it out for a few years to find the right deal and allow the EV infrastructure to build out a little better. But, of course, I got blinded by the pretty car with a hefty car payment.

For context, I'm trying to purchase a Honda S2000. these can fairly go for a price from 18k-40k depending on the mileage of the vehicle. I'm stepping in on a 25k loan.  money isn't exactly the problem its just the process that confuses me. HOW DOES IT REALLY WORK?

before I approach any bank for an auto loan, i want to be as informed as I can. from my knowledge. if I approach the bank for an auto loan, they would ask if I have a specific car in mind with the vin number. Well if thats the case then that means I would've already checked the vehicle out. but what if in the process of me allocating the money for the vehicle. it gets sold to someone else in the process? 

Do I head over to the bank first and try to get a pre approval for a vehicle that I might purchase? and if its a vehicle that I like and want to purchase that day, do I get to call them and let them know to send the money so I can buy it from the private seller?

597,personalfinance,"Hi PF,

I contributed $6000 to my ROTH IRA in 2022, but I am over the income limits for ROTH contributions. I'm considering either recharacterizing or withdrawing my contributions. 

1) withdrawing my $4000 ROTH IRA contribution (NIA = ~$4000) and contributing $6000 to a traditional IRA for 2022

2) recharacterizing my 2022 ROTH IRA contribution to my traditional IRA. 

Follow up: If I recharacterize $4000, can I still contribute $2000 to meet the $6000 limit for traditional IRA contributions?

And also, this article mentions a 6% penalty if I don't recharacterize in the same tax year. Is this actually true?
&gt; you may be able to transfer the excess Roth contribution amount and earnings from your Roth IRA to your Traditional IRA but this must be done in the same tax year to avoid the 6% penalty.

https://www.greenbushfinancial.com/all-blogs/roth-ira-excess-contributions

It seems like withdrawing and contributing to traditional IRA is the best choice here because I'll be able to contribute another $6000 and avoid the 6% penalty. Let me know if I am missing anything.

Thanks!

Bonus: I dug myself into a very unnecessary hole by transferring my ROTH IRA to another brokerage and now they require me to calculate the NIA, write a hold harmless letter, have it notarized, and mail it to them in order to recharacterize / withdraw.",Roth IRA 2022 Excess Contribution Conundrum - Withdraw or Recharacterize?,1673052423
598,personalfinance,"I am new to the world of side gig work, so I may sound very ""rookie"" here (I'd rather ask than flounder through it, right?).  I live, work, and pay taxes in the USA.  I have a regular full time job, but have recently taken on a side gig to supplement my income.  

I am trying to work out the best strategy for paying taxes on the side gig income, which will likely result in about $9,000 to $10,000 in 2023 if all goes well.  I know I have to pay the regular federal income tax, but also the 15.3% self-employment tax as well as my state income tax.  So that's where my questions start.

1) I am thinking of, instead of paying the estimated quarterly tax but instead having my W-4 withholding adjusted through my 'regular' employer, by stating an set amount to withhold from my pay each check.  I'm hoping I did it right, but I based it on the percentage of federal and state taxes withheld from my regular paycheck.  I have about 23% withheld per paycheck for federal and state taxes.  I'd rather estimate high and not have to pay in, so that might be high.

2)  Since my regular employer already calculates in the things self-employment taxes cover (Social Security and Medicare), should I bother to add in another 15.3% on top of that 23%?  Or is that self-employment tax obligation considered ""covered"" if I'm paying in through my employer?   They just care how much I'm paying based on total income from all jobs, right?

3) If I use my regular employer to withhold those extra taxes, do I need to inform the IRS that I'm doing it that way instead of paying in quarterly?  I want to make sure I'm doing all the paperwork correctly - my biggest worry is missing some important stuff and screwing over my family at tax time!

4) I'm thinking of forming an LLC just as an extra layer of protection.  I am ""sole proprietor"" with no employees (just me and some freelance writing).  I don't need an EIN, correct?  I can just do all of this under my SSN, right?  

5) Is it ethical to do this in the first place, to essentially use my primary employer as my tax withholding administrator?  They are a public/ government entity, so would they get questioned about extra withholding if they are audited?  I am always concerned about ethics and doing things the right way, and I like my employer and don't want to cause problems.

Bank offered me 40k debt consolidation loan at 10.7% for 12 months and payback over 5 years to cover all my debts (didnt want all but they recommended all). 

1. If i sign on with it, can i cancel it before the money is dispersed and the loan is approved?

2. If it gets dispersed do i HAVE to use it or can i let it sit?

2.a. Will there be any repercussions if i Dont use it or let it sit or cancel it?

615,personalfinance," I am struggling with this one. While I love my job right now (great W/L balance, great team, etc.), there is a feeling that I am stagnating a little bit. Some of that is on me; there is a ton to learn here but I've been here a while and part of me just wants something new. I work for a very large corporation (50k+), and my new position would be with a much smaller company (\~200) in the same industry. So, definitely more risk moving to the smaller company if there were to be a downturn or something.

Some specific numbers:

**Salary**: Base salary would be increasing by **23%**

**Bonus**: Currently I have a **20% target**, historically it hits around **15%,** based on how well company does. New job would only be **10% max** which is more performance based. Obviously 15% isn't guaranteed, but the past 6 years have been decent, despite the market downturn.

So purely from salary standpoint (base + bonus), its a **21%** difference. So barring all other details, I'd leave for that... but the benefits of my current company are really good.

**Current company 401K + Discount Stock Purchase Plan (DSPP)** \- **6%** match, and **15%** discount on up to **10%** of base salary + bonus. New job would only be **4-5%** 401K match, no DSPP... even then technically there is no 401K plan now, but there will be one in the near future... supposedly. Accounting for these benefits, the raise from old to new job is now only **16.8%**. (Assumes the 401K match actually happens)

**Current company vacation** \- **24** days + **10** federal holidays. New position would only be **15** days + **10**.

New job pays **100%** for medical. But current job is pretty cheap. with the HSA $ they provide, medical is only costing me **\~$800**/year. So not a big deal.

Minor benefits: Current company pays for my cell phone. Nice meals paid for every so often (2-3x per month), access to company suite in sports arenas, etc.

So yea, in summary:

**Pure Salary Raise: 20.75%** based on some assumptions on the bonus, but I think they are safe assumptions.

Include retirement/DSPP perks: only **16.8%** raise TC

Vacation: (I heavily value vacation time) so lowers the raise to **14.4% TC due to losing 7 days vacation**

Medical: Raises the **Total comp to 15%** raise with the new job since its Free.

So on paper, 15% doesn't seem worth it, but wondering if anyone had insight of what I might be missing here. Obviously the new higher salary would be great since that becomes the new floor for future job moves and negotiations. One thing to note as well is that current job allows hybrid office schedule, while new job is 100% office. For the few days of the year that I utilize this, having hybrid schedule is nice because I can work remote while on vacation in a different city.

I (20M) have been part-time employed by a family owned company in New York state for almost 2 years now, working remotely in a very busy call center. Everyone on the team is very interactive and personable with our customers, but there is a high turnover rate -- I am the only person on the team, other than my boss, who has been there for over a year. I am a full-time college student, and my employer/boss are both very generous in the ways that they work with me (I have a custom schedule based around my class times, I have always been granted days off for study days, etc). Over the past 2 years, I have sat side-by-side with many employees for training purposes... some of which who have left the company altogether, but some who have worked their way up to management level positions. I also typically provide any extra hours I have in the day to work, knowing how busy we are and how few people we currently have on the team... this results in full-time schedules over the summer/holidays when I do not have class.

I was on a side-by-side training meeting today with a coworker when I cracked a joke that ""I only get paid 15 dollars an hour, not a manager salary"", in the context of me elevating a customer concern. When I said this, the person I was training looked shocked and informed me that they were being paid $5 an hour than me. This was surprising to me, but makes sense -- I was hired almost 2 years ago, and the job does have a high turnover rate: increasing the pay per hour makes total sense to attract new hires.

My question is what can I do about this? It comes with poetic timing... I am about to go on my first vacation within the last 2 years and will be over the upcoming week. I don't want to seem hostile, as I am very thankful that I get to go to school and continue to work with my employer, but when I zoom out and look big picture, I do contribute a lot to the team, I have trained many coworkers, and even yesterday my boss was telling me how great I am doing, and how some of the higher ups consistently give me kudos for the work ethic I show.

At the time the job was fully remote, and no one knew what the policies were going forward. I was told back to the office could occur in October, then it got pushed back to Nov, then Dec, and now it actually occurred in January. 

During this time, I had my eye on apartments, but when the hybrid model was explained as twice a week, didnt think it was that bad. At the last minute the building next to me I was already in had a place and I thought it was a great deal, especially for LA. I snagged it thinking id get the bonus as well, since the fine print didn’t specify the range I had to move to, so long as I was within a “commutable distance and moved locally” which I already was to begin with. 

Now that I actually moved HR is refusing the bonus payout as I didnt move “close enough” 
. Because I moved out of my parents place and into my own, and not close enough, it wasnt in the “spirit of relocation” according to the HR director (who had actually emailed me saying congrats and that my relocation would be paid out asap before backtracking an hour later, I have the email of him approving that in writing. Backtracked in a zoom call later) 

Here is the fine print (edited out potentially revealing details)

Im kinda pissed too atm as the HR lady called me shady and I thought that was completely unprofessional and disrespectful. Not to mention now making it awkward for me to go to the office and having a run in with this person.

Normally I would invest this cash in a Vanguard index fund or ETF but I feel like in the next year there's a good chance I make &lt; 4.75% or probably more likely lose money if I was to invest in an index fund

I know people always say to not try to time the market and just invest, but I'm thinking a CD with 4.75% is a decent return even for the stock market, and since it is very low risk and a guaranteed 4.75% I should just go that route. With inflation so high I probably won't be making that much really, but it is better than the cash sitting in my checking account losing value or being invested in the stock market when a recession hits

Is this thinking sound, or am I missing something here. More importantly are there any other better investment opportunities I should think about before locking into a CD for 12 months? With Fed interest rates so high right now I know that there are probably other investments I could make but I am unsure what they could be. Is a CD the best and safest option, given that I know I will not need the cash for 12 months",I have ~150~ k to invest and wondering if buying a CD is a good investment decision,1673044741

631,personalfinance,"Hi -

I recently obtained a sum of around $400,000. I am not going into details about how or why, but it IS tax-exempt.

I am a young adult woman and I have no debt. I do not come from money. I know little to nothing about investing, saving, and finances. I do have a job as a server, but currently in a bootcamp for UX with intentions to become a UX Designer. I do not own any property, and while I will have a large amount of cash, I am not sure how I would qualify for a house since my last few years of income is low. Starting salaries for entry level UX designers vary but roughly around \~90k a year. Not sure if this info is important but stating to paint overall picture. I'd like to make this money last, and ease up on my serving shifts to focus on completing my UX bootcamp. My rent is $700 a month. I would also like to invest this money and make more. I know this is a giant head start that many people my age will not receive. I do not want to mess this up.

I was basically told to look into financial advisors before receiving this sum and then good luck once it was in my account. How do I find a reputable financial advisor? I want to learn as much as possible. Is a financial advisor absolutely what I should do? Or go with Charles Schwab? Once again, I don't know basically anything about this world. I don't want to be taken advantage of. This situation has made me quite anxious so I have been avoiding it... so please be kind to me if I sound dumb.

Needless to say my stock portfolio is worth pennies right now (just like everyone else's). My friend told me about short term bond and how their rates are higher than a typical CD and are also subject to no state taxes. I was also thinking of contributing to my IRA and buying bonds from that account and letting it mature in there. Earnings are tax free and I wouldn't be touching it (the contributions at least) unless I'm really in a bind. I also thought about I bonds but they're at 6.98% which is less than the current rate of inflation and I couldn't buy them last year :( 

My goals are really wealth building. I'm not even thinking about home ownership now (not doing it unless I'm married). While I'm really a long term hold kinda person, in 2022 I lost out on pay (because of unforeseen stuff, nothing wrong or illegal or life threatening, dw) and would like to shore up some funds just because. Obv, it'd be nothing like my original pay but really wouldn't mind some sorta returns which are not too pithy.

I have about 60k-70k aside to invest. I logged into my Fidelity and saw a number of (fixed rate)corp &amp; US Treasury bonds with attractive interest rates. Would these be a good use of money?

680,personalfinance,"I would like this groups opinion on if this is a good or foolish money move. My dad now officially solely owns his childhood home that no one has lived in for over 20 years and needs to be cleaned up and updated (maybe needs 10k in repairs - my dad and I would do all the work, he’s a handy man by profession and I enjoy rehab as well). He wants to fix it up and sell it. To me. He wants me to buy it because he would sell it at a good price to me since he won’t have to list it nor involve a real estate agent and he also thinks it would be a profitable rental property for me. He needs to sell it anyways because he needs the money. He offered to be in charge of maintenance while it’s rented and take care of any problems. He does own another rental property that has been successful with great tenants. 

I’ve always been interested in real estate and want to own property as a long term goal but I just don’t know if my first property should be one I don’t live in. I’m interested in FIRE and I think having rental properties would be a good stream of income later in life once the mortgage is paid off. 

I just moved back to the area this house is in from living in a different state and I’m currently living out of an Airbnb while I get my life setup here and find a more permanent place to live. So as I’m technically homeless, it’s tempting to just move in to the house while we fix it up (pay $0 in rent), buy it from my dad, find renters, and then find my own place to rent for myself. I don’t want to live there permanently because the location sucks and I don’t drive. 

I also am not ready to commit to live in this city for a long period of time as I’m still young and have some soul searching to do. So thankfully my dad said he would manage it but what if he can’t anymore or died? I would have to hire a management company and that eats away at profit but still something I’d probably do.

I am also worried I will miss out of first time home buyer programs that insist you must live in the home for a certain period of time to quality for (I’m in NY). If this house is a good deal, would it even be worth it to miss out on these things?

My dad said you don’t make money when you sell a house, you make it when you buy. I feel like I’m in a good financial spot to purchase real estate and should probably diversify my investments anyways.

Now my income + spouse's income is over the IRS income limit for contributing. I know I have to remove these funds by the tax deadline or will face a penalty. My plan was to remove the excess and then in the future open a traditional IRA to start doing the back door Roth contributions, but after looking at the numbers more closely I am now confused on the process. Because the market performed poorly in the last 12 months, my +$4,500 into IRA in 2022 only increased my total balance by &lt;$1,000 at the end of the year.

Example numbers/dates to illustrate: 

Roth IRA balance before any 2022 contributions, March 1: $30,000

Balance after I completed $4,500 in contributions, Sept 1: $29,000

Balance as of Dec 31: $31,000

So my questions - how does total account balance factor into the excess contribution? Did my excess contribution of $4,500 result in a ""gain"" of $1,000, or did I lose $3,500? If it gained $1,000, do I have to remove the $4,500 plus gains (and how do I calculate the gain)? 

Or, do I have to somehow calculate a loss of funds and adjust the amount I pull out of the account for a ""correction"" in eyes of the IRS? Do I just have crappy timing? 

Does any of this change if I open a traditional IRA and do the recharacterization of funds now, instead of withdrawing the excess?

I have been accepted to University of Calgary and have registered for classes for fall 2022. They require me to send my final transcripts through mail but they told me they didn't receive it and my admission could be revoked.

It was tough mentally to give up my dream, so I logged out of the email I registered the university with. I never logged into the university portal or anything just to forget things. Now that I tried logging in to the email, I found out that I am 120+ days overdue and I owe $18000. They have sent this out to an external debt collection agency. My parents will never agree to pay this sum for something I didn't even attend. May I know what effects this might have on me if I decide to come to Canada later in life? Is this debt tied to me?

Hi everyone. So I am almost 30 y/o, I don’t have a house yet but I am planning to start saving for one next year. I make about $69k at my job and I will be getting a raise in a few months which will bring me up to $79k. I have decided to start off this year by paying off my credit cards which will put me in a better position to save for a house.

I currently have a credit card balance of $6400 and I signed onto my account a few months and found out it would take me nearly 20 years to pay off this balance if I continue to make the minimum payment. My current APR is 21.59 which is pretty high. Because of this, I have been paying $400 each month on this credit card bill which has significantly taken away from what I can put towards my savings account. To make matters worse, I have found myself in a bind a few times so I’ve had to use my credit card several times which defeats the purpose of me putting $400 towards the balance each month.

I have a savings of only $4800 (small, I know) but I am planning to withdraw $2500 from this account to put towards my Discover card. According to one of the customer service reps, that will take my minimum payment from $148 to $79. If I do this, I plan to pay a balance of $140 each month and doing this will give me about 36 months to pay it off. I plan to put a large portion of my income tax towards the balance this year as well. 

Paying off a chunk of this CC balance will allow me to rebuild my savings account which is one of my main motivator. I bring home about $2800 each month and $1600 of that goes towards bills which I believe is too much. I am trying to figuring out how to add a second stream of income this year because I really want to pay my CCs down very quickly so that I can start saving for a house. I am thinking of doing Amazon FBA but I’m still on the fence. If I can bring in an extra $2k each month, I would be happy.

For those of you who are financially savvy, does this sound like a good idea?

I am the primary wage earner and our financial situation allows my wife to pick her job and hours based on what she likes and not based on needing the income. We do not have any children and due to unforeseen circumstances, children are not likely for us. We are 100% debt free and we do not rent or lease anything (own one vehicle and own a house). We have a budget, but this is used more to track expenses than restrict spending as we routinely have a few thousand more dollars each month than we spend. So this ""extra"" money has been being saved for some house projects. We also have roughly 7 months worth of expenses in cash (savings / checking account).

&amp;#x200B;

Our retirement income planning includes a defined pension through my work, a 401k through my work, an HSA and we each have a Roth IRA. We generally aim to invest a minimum 20% of our pre-tax income between the 401k, HSA and Roth IRA. All of the money in the 401k, HSA and Roth IRA are invested in the Fidelity target date retirement fund closest to my retirement date at age 60.

My question stems from the ""extra"" money described above. This year we are anticipating finishing some of our house projects and will no longer have a need for additional cash savings. As a result, I want to put this money to work. We will already be maxing out a 401k, HSA and two Roth IRAs, so my thought is to invest this ""extra"" money using a brokerage account through fidelity and dump every penny into FXAIX (Fidelity's S&amp;P 500 index fund). I don't foresee a reason we would need this money in the short term. I have considered using it for a down payment on a rental, but after a lot of consideration my wife and I have decided we don't want the stress or work of dealing with a rental.

I haven’t had any large maintenance costs, though have bought some new high quality pieces of appliances such as a kitchen aid, new washer and dryer, Samsung Frame TV but then a ton of fast fashion clothes, junk, decor, whiz bang accessories for my camera or iPad which I don’t actually use, bought a PS5 which I don’t use, got my car fully detailed which wasn’t needed, have bought a million books I haven’t read… the list goes on. 

I can feel my mindset being just like, you have 20k why bother saving more? Yet it’s going on nothing but junk and useless materials and I cannot stop myself. Every item feels justified. That “wait 48hrs before you buy it to see if you really like it” doesn’t work because even after 48hrs I still have this weird desired to buy anything that takes my fancy. I just bought a new Fuji camera worth 2k even though I already had a good Nikon one. I should have saved for it, put a little bit of money away each pay so I don’t drop the full amount in one month but then I just got obsessed with the need to have it… and since buying it haven’t even used it like everything else.

I hate this mentally I have of “well I can afford it” so just buy it. Luckily nothing is on credit card but I swear soon enough I’ll start drawing down on those savings for more stupid stuff. I feel like there’s some part of me sabotaging myself. I know I shouldn’t buy these things yet this insaaaane obsession to just buy everything I like is taking over. 

I earn just over 150k a year and do max out my retirement fund but I don’t want to be this person and want to feel satisfied in growing my savings. After all living expenses I should be able to save 45-50k a year but literally down to saving zero in the past year and my spending isn’t slowly down even with all the logic that I need to stop buy crap. My mind these days is just spend spend spend!

I'm really only worried about consolidating my credit cards into 1 payment at a lower interest rate if possible but if I don't do the car collateral crap then it goes from 15% to 28% (on $5,810) which is instantly not worth it because that's my current credit card rates.

Instead it says:

Regular: 24hrs @ 21.98
Overtime: 12hrs @32.97

Total: $923.07

While the total amount is correct I’m concerned about why they processed my pay in this way. There is also ambiguous language in the employee handbook that makes me think I will only accrued
hours during my “regular” hours worked and not OT. That would still be fine if it wasn’t for the fact that the payroll person told me whenever she puts in a day for PTO the system takes out 12 hours of accrued PTO. 

That only makes sense if both my regular and OT hours accrue at the same rate. 

The payroll person called it the 80/40 rule. She mentioned there’s a handful of us salaried workers who are treated this way and that it was explained to her at some point but she still doesn’t get it. The Administrator called it the 8/2 or 8/4 rule so it sounds like he’s not fully sure either how it works. 

I don’t get what the point of this system is. How does it help the company? And if it helps the company is it at the expense of my PTO?

The administrator called the corporate payroll person and left a message. He’s supposed to call us in when they call back for a meeting.

767,personalfinance,"My wife and I are behind on filing taxes, and this year we are making the push to get caught up. I've gone to several resources to determine how this will work, and what it will cost.

So far, it seems that where you would normally fill in your information online and file online, you instead have to download software (which mimics how the website would've worked in that prior year) to fill in your information, and you can only file by mail.  Okay, no problem.

But the software you have to download costs money, which you have to pay up front before you start entering any of your information.  For example, H&amp;R Block charges $45 per prior year to download that year's software.

So this is where the confusion arises: normally, you are charged at the end, to generate your tax return, so that it can be filed.  My assumption through this research process has been that cost will still be present. My wife thinks that the software is exactly what we pay for every year when we fill out our info online, so she believes the $45 will be the total cost.

I’ve recently paid down a decent portion of my more pressing debts (credit cards and vehicle expenses) and just wanted to ask what to do with the ‘extra income’ I’m now taking home each month from not paying said debts down monthly.

Some relevant info:
•I live in the US.
•I’m under 25.
•Not married, no kids.
•I currently contribute 4% of my paycheck to my 401k (which is the min. to hit my employer’s match rate). My 2022 contributions were just shy of $3.5k.
•My only remaining debt is from my student loans. If the loan forgiveness occurs, I have already been informed that I’m eligible for $10k. Otherwise, I owe ~$25k. All of these are federal, with an interest rate range of 3.5-5.5% depending on the individual loan group.
•After standard day-to-day living expenses, my take home is looking to be ~$2k/month.
•I’m not currently in the market for a home, but would like to save towards a downpayment at some point.
•Current savings are ~$3.5k.

Basically, I just want to know what the best plan of attack is at this point. I’m nowhere near maxing my 401k contributions for the year, student loan payments are still paused, and I want to save for a home at some point.

I was charged an overdraft fee which I expected, but then today those charges actually posted and I was charged more overdraft fees.

All the charges were greater than $5.30 so it's not like I made 4 small charges that each overdrafted, it was only one charge that caused it to go over.

Looking at my bank app, it shows that the first overdraft fee was charged while I still had a positive balance, but because of that fee, the charges that posted today brought it even more negative.

I talked to the bank and they said the first fee was because I had pending charges being held which brought my available balance to -$5.30, but my posted balance for that day was still positive even with the fee, but because of the fee I couldn't cover the pending charges.

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/23/tax-free-rollovers-from-529-plans-to-roth-iras-may-be-allowed-in-2024.html

 - A $35,000 lifetime cap on transfers.
  
-Rollovers are subject to the annual Roth IRA contribution limit. (The limit is $6,500 in 2023.)
    
-The rollover can only be made to the beneficiary’s Roth IRA — not that of the account owner. (In other words, a 529 owned by a parent with the child as beneficiary would need to be rolled into the child’s IRA, not the parent’s.)
    
-The 529 account must have been open for at least 15 years. (It seems changing account beneficiaries may restart that 15-year clock, Levine said.)
    
-Accountholders can’t roll over contributions, or earnings on those contributions, made in the last five years.

I am 45 and have two young children, one is 11 yrs away from starting college, it the other is 14 yrs away.  

It seems like the smart play is to change the 529 beneficiaries to myself and my wife from my children to start that 15-year clock running now. 

The benefits:

- if my children get a scholarship, other financing, or don't attend college I can start rolling it over in 15 years to my own Roth, not my children's.

-if they do attend school I can open up a second Roth in my name, transfer whatever money they need from original to new 529, then switch to them as beneficiaries so I'll never have more saved than they need.

-since I will be close to the 59 1/2 yr old free Roth withdrawal age, if I choose to give my children money to help start their independent lives I can have all options on table, including taking older money for my current Roth and giving it to them while I add new money from the 529.

I’ve followed some great advice from this subreddit over the years…

Paid off student loans 
Started an IRA
Max out my retirement accounts to the best of my ability 
Etc.

But in a couple months I’ll be getting a new car, Rivian R1T to be be specific, and my configuration comes out to ~90k after all taxes, fees, and delivery.

1) take a loan for full value 
2) take a loan and sell some stock
3) sell a bunch of stock and pay for it outright 

With the current economic situation impacting the US I know loan rates have gone up, I know my stock value has gone down, and I am sure I’ll get a couple “why would you spend so much on a car in this economic climate?!?”

I've come into a little bit of cash, about $8,000.00 and I am looking for some guidance to pay out some debt.

I am looking for a good strategy to pay some of this out not sure where to start.  
I have enough to pay 3 accounts out, 1 account out, or pay out nearly half of one account.  
Secondly, I can pay out one account, then balance transfer a portion of the $20,000 higher interest account back to it for a much lower rate 0.99%. 

Another thing to consider, my income may not be as high moving forward as it is this month - so lowering monthly minimums is a must, either paying out a card, or lowering a balance will obviously lower the monthly minimum I guess the goal is to have that monthly minimum as low as possible.

Another thing I have considered is making a 10% pmt across all accounts and hoarding the rest to do the same next month.

796,personalfinance,"Hi all,

Current salary of 92k, I am at a company that offers a defined benefit plan (pension) in which I am fully vested after 5 years (meaning I would get something even if leaving the company after 5 years) and I also receive a 3% 401k match (immediate vesting). 

I personally save 20% into traditional 401k. So I am taking as much advantage as I can in my current predicament.

Downside of all of this is that my position will be slow. There will be time and opportunity for new responsibility and promotion in my future (currently 28) but prior to this the biggest jumps in salary I have seen have obviously been from jumping companies, so I can fairly easily predict a standard 3% comp increase for many future years.

Is there some sort of calculator anyone could point me to to compare higher salary + 401k at another company vs perhaps staying here for my career and taking a lower income?

Pension would be 1% of final month's pay x years of service (with a reduction percentage if you retire prior to 65).

Company A has placed some policies in terms of guaranteed bonus throughout the year to keep me around if the sale doesn't go through due to my knowledge of the systems. They also have placed some guarantees of those bonuses if the company sale is finalized. So, I am looking to be paid around 10-15% of my salary. 

Meanwhile, Company B has made me a conditional offer with the same salary as Company A. I know the salaries have changed in IT since I have joined Company A, and I want to get the proper salary because I am seeing this as a new company offer. Company B has made it clear that they want to buy the business unit as it is today, so they sound like they don't want to budge. They have also mentioned that I will be subject to market and performance review when it takes place. I am assuming that may only meet inflation or may even be below it. As I see it, I think my chance is now to negotiate, but don't know if something might be stopping the company from changing my offer due to some rules or laws.

I believe Company B's benefits stack pretty well against Company A so that's not an issue. I am looking for about 20% raise but not sure if I can negotiate on a conditional offer letter in hand. I am leaning towards playing even hard ball with them since they need me and my knowledge.

I'm recently graduated and have about $70-80k in federal loans. The majority (~$50k) of these are parent plus loans under my parents' name, but they are making me pay them, which is fine, we agreed to this.

I have about $15k saved up over the last 6 months while I've been living rent-free with family, but I've just now signed a new lease on an apartment with my S.O. that will cost me about $1300 a month. I will be covering 100% of the rent as my S.O. can't work much because of her school schedule. But she will contribute to the utilities and rent over the summer when she has more free time.

So here's the dilemma: I'd like to put this money to good use, but I'm unsure whether I should throw it at my loans or use it for my rent each month, or if there is a hidden third option that makes even more sense? I haven't put a single dent into my loans as the government keeps extending the moratorium.

Here are some more details about my situation:

* **Salary**: $82k. After taxes, benefits, and 401k, my monthly take home is about $4100.

* **Area**: LCoL, however it has been quickly rising towards MCoL in recent years.

* **Other expenses**: My car bill and phone bill combined runs me about $120.

Because my parents will pay the loan amount every month would I be able to take the loan payments for the whole year and add them to my income?

843,personalfinance,"# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to announce that we're continuing our 30-day challenge series. The schedule spans the entire year so be sure to keep an eye out each month.

This month's 30-day challenge is to **get on top of your credit.** Here are some concrete steps you can take:

# Check your free credit report

There are three major credit bureaus in the US: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. These companies each gather credit histories for individuals and sell that information to credit card companies, lenders, and other financial institutions.

You can go to https://www.annualcreditreport.com to get a credit report from each credit bureau once per year. It's often recommended to stagger your requests so you can get one every four months so you may only want to request one report at this time. You can use a calendar reminder to stay on top of this.

Now, your free credit report won't include your score and it also won't include credit monitoring, but you absolutely don't need to buy those from a credit bureau because there are free options. See below.

Note that the security questions will sometimes ask about intentionally false information (e.g. made-up loans), so ""none of the above"" may be the right answer. If you can't get past the security questions, you may have to write in to get your report. Also be aware that you don't have to pay for anything on the credit bureau sites. If you find yourself prompted for a credit card number, you might have clicked to sign up for something you might not need or want.

Also, if you have trouble with the web site, try temporarily disabling browser ad-blockers and privacy extensions.

See the [Credit Reports Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_reports) for more information!

# Sign up for free credit monitoring

You don't need to pay for credit monitoring. Some options:

* A variety of companies such as [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/) and [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) offer free credit monitoring services. [There's a longer list of options in our Wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico#wiki_how_can_i_get_my_fico_score_or_a_score_estimate_for_free.3F)

* Many employers also offer free credit monitoring for their employees directly with a credit bureau. Check with your benefits department.

* Finally, if you've been the victim of a data breach like Target or Anthem, those companies are providing free credit monitoring for anyone potentially affected.

After exploring your options, sign up with at least one of them. More information contained in the [Credit Scoring Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico).

# Find out your credit score

You can now [get your FICO score for free from Discover](https://www.creditscorecard.com/) without a credit card.

In addition, a number of credit cards actually give you a free FICO score as a benefit of having their card. Brands providing FICO scores include Discover, Citi (branded cards only), American Express, Bank of America, and Barclaycard. [Here's a full list of options.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/fico#wiki_how_can_i_get_my_fico_score_or_a_score_estimate_for_free.3F)

In addition, you can get your VantageScore from [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/) or [Mint](https://www.mint.com/). VantageScore is used less often by creditors than FICO, but it's a *usually* a good estimate of your FICO score. Paying for your credit score is silly unless you're considering getting a major loan like a mortgage.

# Get rid of pre-approved credit card junk mail

[OptOutPrescreen.Com](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/) is the official consumer credit card reporting website to opt-out of offers of credit or insurance. It's an easy win to reduce junk mail and reduce the risk of identity theft (from someone stealing your mail). I recommend signing up unless you're in the process of building credit and actually want to receive pre-approved offers.

# Are you looking to improve your credit?

Once you have a score over 740, most credit files are solid enough to qualify for prime rate lending. This means that any additional increase of your score will likely not get you better credit products.

If you are in a position where you'd like to improve your credit, here are two situations that often befall people when asking for help here:

* [""I have no credit, and I am looking to get started.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building#wiki_i_have_no_credit.2C_and_i_am_looking_to_get_started.)
* [""I have bad credit, and I am looking to repair it.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building#wiki_i_have_bad_credit.2C_and_i_am_looking_to_repair_it.)

# What to do if you find information you don't recognize

Even though credit reporting is automated, mistakes can still occur. The most common errors can involve names and addresses. If your name is similar to a parent's name, there are also instances where a line of credit is reported on the wrong file.

The simplest course of action is to dispute the information with the bureaus. Here are direct links to initiate a dispute:

* [Equifax](https://experian.referral.equifax.com/CreditInvestigation/home.action)
* [Experian](http://www.experian.com/disputes/main.html)
* [TransUnion](https://onlinedispute.transunion.com/disputewizard/)

Finally, if you believe you've had your identity stolen, read and follow the steps in our **[Identity Theft Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft)**.

# If you're not in the United States

[The PF wiki has many more countries covered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_reports#wiki_what_if_i.27m_not_in_the_united_states.3F) If you would like to add information for your country to the wiki, please message the moderation team.

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 3 or more of the following things:

* Requested a free credit report via annualcreditreport.com
* Set a reminder to request a different credit report in 4 months
* Found out your credit score (either FICO or VantageScore)
* Signed up for free credit monitoring
* Opted out of pre-screened offers
* Initiated a credit dispute with one or more credit bureaus

If you're outside of the US, you've successfully completed this challenge once you've done the following things:

* Read up on whether there is a credit scoring system in your country and find out how it works (see the previous section and also try searching the internet).
* If it exists, find out how you can get information about your own report or score or whatever it's called, get that information if possible, and check it for accuracy.
* If there are items on there that you can try to fix, start doing so. For example: pay down debts, talk to the credit reporting agency about inaccurate items, etc.","30-Day Challenge #1: Get on top of your credit (January, 2023)",1673010002

845,personalfinance,"I’ve (M37) not been great historically at managing my money. My mental health (though improved from what it once was) has dips and troughs and I have a habit of over spending when struggling.

However, I would like to stop relying on my dad. Is there a way I can set up a second current account in my own name to continue the same process.

Synchrony bank: $1100 @ 0% until June.

Current debts:

Student/ graduate overdraft: £2000 interest free for 12 months, then the interest free portion gradually reduces. 

Personal Loan: £4100 left at 2.7% apr, monthly payments of £163. £4100 includes the interest I’ll have payed if I take it to term (another 25 months). 

Current savings 

Help to buy ISA: £2500 with negligible interest 

Cash: £1200 

Current annual salary/ monthly take home: £45k/ £2100. 
I’ll also get a £5k pay rise in November 2023. 

Current essential expenses: £1200

Savings goal: minimum £400/ month, target £500/ month 

Life circumstances:

Renting with partner (£1400pcm) who has a similar income but owns a property outright (currently rented out). Planning to buy together at some point after April 2024. Partner planning to contribute £60-80k to a deposit financed by selling existing property (leaving her &gt;£50k cash).

The question: 

Im aware that a usual approach would be to use my savings and cash to clear my debts starting with the 2.7% loan. However given I’m planning to buy relatively soon, would it actually make more sense to use my savings to take out and maximise my LISA (£4K) before April 2023. I could then do the same next year and again in April 2024 leaving me with £12k (£3k bonus plus interest) for a house deposit? As far as I can see this is much better value than the interest I’d save on the loan. 

I’d also need to clear my interest free overdraft within 12 months and keep making my minimum loan payments (already factored into “essential expenses”). I’ve factored this in to my budget. 

Is this plan reasonable or is there anything I’m missing or should consider? 

Bonus question, I have a postgraduate student loan currently owing £11100. The interest on this has skyrocketed to 6.5%. I pay 6% of my salary over the £21k threshold (currently about £120 a month). If my salary doesn’t change I’d pay this off in 8 years and it would cost me £15000 to pay off my £11000 debt. Is it worth overpaying on this? My understanding is my overpayments would effectively have a 6.5% return on investment (the same as the interest rate of the loan)? I know you should almost never try and pay off a student loan but is this one of the few times it might be worth doing? Also would it be worth trying to find interest free credit cards or a loan under 6.5% apr to pay it off in full and lower the interest?

854,personalfinance,"Long story short: 

I bought a fixer-upper home 1 year ago and am yet to move in.  Contractor took $50k of my money, did maybe half the work, and walked. He’s now filing chapter 7 and the legal process fighting him will take forever. Doing what I can but need to move on with life in the meantime. 

Goal is to finish the house and make it habitable. Right now, paying the mortgage on the house ($1231 USD monthly plus electric/gas is another $130 with heat prices) AND rent of $2300 plus utilities on our apartment is insane. 

This wasn’t the plan, contractor was to finish months ago and we’d be in a fixed up house with an affordable mortgage at 3.5%, but “shit happens” right? 

I don’t have enough in savings to finish the house out of pocket. A refinance/construction loan on the house doesn’t seem like a good option according to mortgage brokers. Family can’t lend me any money either, they’re either dead or broke. 

My thought is take out a personal loan and just get the work done. I have a couple reputable contractors giving estimates of $22-30k to get it wrapped up. Really need to stop this bleeding of paying for 2 homes. 

Discover will lend me $35k for 84 months at 12.99%. Payment would be $636.53 a month. 72 months would be 11.99% with a $684.07 payment. 

Fiancée lives with me and pays half of the rent where we are. She’d pay half of the mortgage note once we’re moved into the house. I haven’t asked her to pay on that because legally, the house is only mine. 

Any thoughts on this? My FICO (per discover) is 814. Credit Karma says 823. I make in the low $50’s gross annually.  

That rate from discover seems high doesn’t it? Frankly I need the money quickly and discover offers no origination fees or prepayment fees so that’s a plus.

* Jan 1st: contribute $6500 to my Vanguard traditional IRA, whose prior balance is $0. I will claim no deductions for this contribution in my 2023 tax return.
* Jan 5th: the transaction clears - my traditional IRA's settlement fund now has $6500. I initiate a conversion to my Vanguard Roth IRA.
* Jan 6th (this morning): the conversion clears, and my Roth IRA settlement fund now has $6500.75. Previously the balance was $0 - all assets were invested in VTWAX.
* I check the account history for my traditional IRA, and sure enough the settlement fund earned a $0.75 dividend while my $6500 was on its way to my Roth IRA.

I was working in healthcare from 2018-2020 where I was contributing to a 403b. After leaving that job in august 2020, I completely forgot about the 403b as my new employer offered a 401k. I recently got notified that my previous employer rolled the 403b over into an IRA. I checked it and there’s not a whole lot in there (a little over $3k).

I’m 24 and about to start a position that is 65k/yr. and trying to get my retirement plan sorted. However after reading through Mutual of America’s 403b prospectus, the fees look very suspicious. I maxed out my Roth IRA— I’m thinking now of putting 100% of my retirement contributions in a high-yield savings account (my Capital One savings is 3.3% right now) and saving until I can put a down payment on an condo that can provide immediate cash flow (however small) and help me build equity. I’m able to do the work of managing an investment property. Since my employer (a nonprofit, hence the 403b instead of 401k) does not match contributions at any percent, I am thinking strongly that saving towards an investment property would be a better decision for building sustainable wealth. Might as well take advantage of high interest rates now with a high-yield savings account, then when the mortgage market is looking better in a few years, make the purchase myself. Anyone have any thoughts or advice? 

Addendum— I am working now but planning on going back to school so I won’t have the same paycheck for a few years. Trying to factor this into my investment plan. I know inflation is high but those fees on the 403b make me very very suspicious, and I think saving in a high yield savings would preserve the value of my money better than a 403b.

876,personalfinance,"Going to use round numbers for simplicity. I’ve worked at a company for a couple of years, 401K is at $30k and I’ve maxed my contribution this year.

1. After maxing this year, my company switched 401k providers, and for whatever reason my contributions restarted for a few pay periods until it was caught.
2. So let’s say that my account is now at $30k + $10k of over contribution.
3. The company 401k transition was messed up. I’ll spare the details, but because of it, employees have not access to the funds for several months. This meant, among other things, that the over contributions haven't been corrected.
4. I left the company and was able to initiate a rollover of all the funds into my own brokerage (IRA) and it was approved on the front end. As I said, I wasn’t able to get my company to fix the over contributions and so the check I’ve been sent to start the rollover is for all $40k.

The issue I have is how to handle the over contribution (I assume the $30k rollover should be straightforward). There are at least two loose ends I think need solutions:

* The first is getting the new brokerage to not put the $10k into a retirement account. Can they just deposit $30k from the check into the IRA and deposit the $10k into a non-retirement account? Or do all the funds rollover into an IRA and I have to somehow get $10k out later?
* The second is how to deal with taxes. As of today, I still haven't paid taxes on the $10k (because they were marked as tax exempt retirement deductions in my paycheck). Do I just add these as additional income somewhere along the way when filing taxes? I suspect this answer may also be dependent on how the brokerage issue gets resolved.

I'm now overseas (basically the other side of the world) with no access to overseas calling, which limits my methods of communication to just email or social media/online messaging. This is the message I sent to BofA on both Facebook and Twitter:

""Hello, I am currently overseas so I don't have any way to call customer service.

Due to a mistaken transaction on my credit card on November 28th, all of what was on my checking account was transferred to my credit card account. Due to the nature of having to physically type in every digit for such a transfer, I know that I have not done this myself, so this was a bug or something with the system. 
I called customer service about this and they have let me know that it would take up to 2 billing cycles to get this undone.

I have wanted to do a backdoor Roth conversion however the tax situation was a little complicated with the mixture of pre and post tax.

899,personalfinance,"My wife and I really got into the FIRE movement and with frugality and investing we've managed to reach $1.5M in networth ($2M before the big market drop) at age 32. Kids entered the picture (we've got 3 under 5) which caused our frugal mindset to completely change. We still don't spend much on ourselves, but we didn't want to be frugal about providing opportunities to our children so our spending increased dramatically (private school, extracurriculars, upgraded housing, etc.). Around this time we also realized we didn't want to retire early, instead we both plan to work for as long as we can.

We make $300k in household income. We used to save 60%+ of our post-tax income so I was shocked to realize not only are we not saving anything now, but in 2022 we actually spent about $30k more than our post-tax income! There's definitely a little fat we can cut, but we expect a deficit to remain and even for the deficit to worsen if we have another kid and as the kids get older and have more extracurriculars and go to college.

Thankfully we haven't had to sell any investments to fund the deficit during the recent market downturn because we always keep $100k in cash, but I anticipate going forward we'll have to be selling some of our stock portfolio each year to cover the deficit, if we want to maintain our lifestyle.

Obviously it's not a good situation to be spending more than you earn, but with perhaps an alternate take on FIRE and the concept of SWR, maybe this is sustainable? According to the 4% SWR, we could sell up to $60k ($1.5M \* 4% = $60k) of our stock portfolio each year without the principal depleting within 30 years. As long as our deficit remains below $60k per year, we could sustain our current spending indefinitely. Furthermore, since we had kids young we might also not need to fund these deficits for very long, maybe just another 20 years. The oldest will be out of the house when we're 45 so we'll still have the opportunity in our 40's and 50's to beef up our retirement savings. The spending of my wife and I pre-kids was modest so we won't need huge retirement savings. My wife and I both also have pensions from our employers, which might cover a significant portion of our retirement savings anyways. If we can finesse our finances so that we die with zero, that would be amazing.

I think the biggest risk factor is if one of us loses our job. Our modest deficit will skyrocket if one of us is off work for an extended period of time. Fortunately, we're both in very stable industries. My wife works as an analyst for the gov't and is unionized. I'm in-house counsel for a blue-chip company.

I think the best solution to our problems would be to just earn more money. Both my wife and I have chosen lower paying jobs in our respective industries so as to have stability and undemanding work schedules so we can spend more time with the kids. But my wife is happy where she is and unfortunately I don't like my profession and would rather stand in traffic than return to private practice. Instead I've been focusing my energy on starting a promising business idea. I've already signed the lease and the next step is the build-out. If the business does as well as my analysis suggests it should, we won't have concerns about spending above our means, but I want to be conservative and assume the business fails and our incomes remain more or less the same as today.

904,personalfinance,"Hi, long time lurker first time poster (also posting to r/investing).

Grew up in a poor family and was lucky enough to receive a bit of money when my great grandpa passed away in 2019. I invested with NWM (some in a Roth, some just managed by them) but am feeling like that was a mistake. It seemed great at the time because I had no idea what I was doing, had no family/friends to ask, and was really overwhelmed. Their advisors had helped me refinance my student loans in college for free (without me buying anything) and it was a good experience.

Looking at it now, NWM seems really predatory and has really high fees. I think it would make sense to pull my money out, but I want to have a clear plan on what to do with it first. I'm thinking about setting up a Roth IRA through TD Ameritrade (Schwab) and using something like SPY-- does that make sense for the roll over?

For the rest, I'm hoping to keep it in funds that have a middle of the road risk. It'd be nice to use it in a couple of years for a down payment on a house or car. I'd like to be able to access at least some of it if I need it. Should I be looking into stocks, bonds, ETFs, CDs? 

I'm not sure where to start, and the lurking over the past few months has helped a little but also confused me a lot. I'm also not sure if I should wait until my NWM accounts come back up so I break even, or just take the L. To be fully honest I'm not even sure that NWM is that bad, I'm just seeing bad things about them on this sub and am tired of them trying to sell me things I don't want.

We’ve spent $12k of our own money making minor renovations we’d have to make whether we decide to rent or sell.

We could rent it for $1600/mo. Monthly expenses would be about $400/month (property taxes, HOA, insurance). We’d manage it ourselves as we live nearby and we’re both pretty handy. 

I’m leaning toward selling. If we’re using only the rental income toward paying off the HELOC it will take us many years to pay that off and generate a profit of $180k.

I am making this post not only to try to solve my own problems, but also to try to inform others that they may be entitled to missed vacation pay from past work experience.

The story: I worked at a restaurant for a few years before Covid happened and left just prior to the pandemic in November 2019. I had informed my employer that I was leaving, arranged to pick up my final cheque, and parted on good terms with them and the company.

3 years later in 2022, I returned to the restaurant and essentially picked up where I left off, though a few things were different, such as rhe day-to-day, management, menu, and the fact that the company had changed from auto-deposit for cheques to in-person cheques bi-weekly.

After receiving my first in-person cheque from a new manager, she also informed me that there were 2 envelopes waiting for me instead of just the usual 1 in-person cheque (she had assumed that I had missed a pay period and this was my pay from w weeks prior) but open opening the envelope I saw a cheque from 2019 for my vacation pay of just under $900.

I was never informed/notified that there was a cheque waiting for me or that I was missing a large amount of money.

My new manager had informed me that the cheque had lapsed and that they would need to issue me a new one, and after many email and text message exchanges I finally received the vacation pay cheque after months of back-and-forth. I had even considered legal action at one point, as it didn't seem like the company had any intention of issuing me a new cheque even though I was a current employee at the time.

4 weeks ago, I once again left the restaurant for different reasons and still considered the patting to be on good terms, but once again my vacation pay has not been issued to me nor does it look like they intend to.

I have a feeling that this is not the first time they've had issues of not paying out vacation pay, and there are quite likely multiple pat employees who have also never received their vacation pay as well. In this situation, I'm wondering what next steps to take and if I should have done something different with the first cheque (Possibly even legal action) and if there are indeed past employees that never received their vacation pay, is there anything to be done about it?

Thank you for reading!

TLDR; worked at a company for years, left, came back and saw my vacation pay cheque from 3 years earlier but couldn't collect it.

948,personalfinance,"I was recently gifted $40,000 from the split inheritance of deceased family member. I wanted to make sure I'm using the money for my best financial interest and was hoping to find some guidance or advice.

My only debt is my auto loan. I have 19 months of payments left @ 3.49% with a current balance of $6,400. The minimum payment is $378, but I've paid a little extra and rounded up to $400 for a large portion of the payments.

I have $37,000 saved in my credit union savings account, so after this gift I'll have $77,000. I save on average $1,000 a month into this account.

I have been saving up to purchase a home for a while and was in the market this past summer. However, the competitive nature of my area and the high interest rates put a damper on it this fall, so I decided to wait out the winter to see what the market does. I resigned a lease and have 6 months left with the option to extend 3 months or resign a new lease if I can't find something. At current interest rates, I'm looking at a house costing $330k-$340k and putting 10% down.

My initial thought is to open a high yield savings account and put the majority of my savings balance in it and let that money sit until I jump back into the market. I would like to leave around $24,000 after purchasing a home as a 6 month emergency fund.

One thing I wasn't sure about was paying off my car loan. It would be great to free up the ~$380 monthly payment to be used as extra cash flow. But, at the relatively low interest I am unsure if it's better to keep the loan and use the $6,400 in a different way. Also it may bring my credit score down and possibly change what mortgage rate I'm approved for.

I also wasn't sure if I should take some of this money and invest it in another way. I am a novice when it comes to my own investments, but am willing to learn. I do have a pension and a 457 plan through my employer that I've been contributing to.

Finally, I am unsure if I should plan to put more than 10% down on a house. Putting down 20% would be great to avoid PMI, but I would be cutting into my emergency fund. 

I am most likely missing information, so please let me know if I need to provide more.","Just received an inheritance, not sure what the next steps are.",1672973192

A couple of weeks ago, I applied for another job that offers more money than I make at my current work. It wasn't planned, but given that my current employer screwed me with the yearly bonus and doesn't plan to give me a raise in the near future, I decided to check for other options.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a QA engineer, and it's not my first time seeking a job. Still, I never suspected that getting a job could imply four interviews with different people and a test assignment that seems more like completing a whole project.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I passed all the interviews, and they seemed happy with the testing results, but after the last interview, I was asked to bring my previous three paystubs since they needed additional information before giving me a final answer. When I asked what they were looking for and told them no previous employer had asked for such data, the HR said it's common practice and told me they couldn't take me in without them.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want them to know how much I earn with my current firm, and I said I'd send the pay stubs partially blacked out, but I got a """"Why? Do you have something to hide?"""".

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not against showing them, though it seems weird. The issue is that despite those four meetings, we haven't discussed my wage yet. Whenever I tried raising the money topic, they switched the subject to my skills and professional aspirations.

I told a few friends about it, but none of them had heard of such a practice. Finally, a former colleague advised me to use a [paystub generator](https://www.thepaystubs.com/) and fill the income fields with the desired salary so they'd offer me better pay.

986,personalfinance,"Hey folks. So I went through a rough patch last few years. In May 2022 lost my job and it took me almost 6 months to get rehired. I make $150K, so I am good now, and I am crossing my fingers this lasts at least a few years.

During my work break I ended up racking up about $10K in credit card debt and used up my emergency fund. Not terrible. This was basic expenses and nothing too extravagant.

I paid off about $3K already. So I have about $7K left. Pretty high interest so I am trying to pay it off asap. 

How would you recommend I pay the rest off? I was originally planning to just take every other paycheck that's not going to housing\car payment and pay everything off in the next two months. But I am taking a risk because I'll basically have no savings during the time. I wanted to rebuild my emergency fund and also didn't want to touch any of my investments or retirement accounts. I really want to pay this balance asap as I hate debt, but I am afraid that if something happens with my job or something, I'll be left without a net. I can obviously rack up more debt, but I don't want to do that. 

What would you do in my place?

I have a 10-year background in Life Insurance and I did well on the 1st and 2nd interviews and I was offered the job. I have been unemployed since April 2022 with a small job from June - September 2022. I have had multiple interviews and had no luck so far, so I really need this job. So why am I hear asking for advice? Well, there are some concerns/red flags. Allow me to share my job offer, with some info removed so as to not dox the location, they are truly nice people. 

 

Dear Travis4261,  

We are excited to offer you a dental assistant  position (red flag #1, the job I applied/interviewed for was  Insurance Billing Coordinator) with us. We believe that you will be a wonderful addition to our great team.  

Highlights regarding the terms of our offer are as follows:

· Tuesday 7:45 – 6:30 pm 

· Wednesday 7:45 – 6:30 pm 

· Thursday 7:45 - 6:30 pm 

· Friday  7:45 - 6:30 pm 

o New scrubs will be provided after your first 90-day trial period is completed 

o Compensation 

· $17.50/hour ( Red Flag #2 I was asked what is the minimum I would work for in my interview and I said this amount, however, it was prior to me knowing that this job offered little to no benefits. I was told salary was negotiable multiple times)  


· Six (6) paid holidays per year 

· Paid Time Off 

§ 1 year – end of calendar year 1 week (prorated) (Red Flag #3 very minimal PTO no mention of sick days)

§ 1 to 3 calendar years  1 week 

§ 5 calendar years  2 weeks 

§ 10 calendar years  3 weeks 

o 401(k) 

· Eligibility after one calendar year of employment (Red flag #4, 1 year wait for 401k match? never heard of such a thing)

· Matching up to 3% 

· Profit Sharing 

· Complimentary financial guidance with H&amp;S Companies 

(Red flag #5) During interviews #1 and 2, I was told one of the benefits is that any dental procedure that can be completed in this office, for myself or my spouse would be covered 100%. This benefit is not mentioned anywhere in this job offer)

Please consider our offer and call/text \*\*\*\*\*\*\* on her cell phone with questions and/or concerns.  

Have a Great Day! Dr. \*\*\*\*\* and Dr. \*\*\*\*\*   


Pros: I NEED a Job, its less than 1 mile from home, pretty laid-back atmosphere   
Cons: there are no benefits such as Medical, Vision, Short/Long Term Disability, or little paid time off (my wife does have these at her job)

My initial thoughts on a counteroffer are.  


Get my job title corrected in the offer.  
Confirm that there is at least 1 week of paid sick time separate from PTO  
Make sure the offer regarding 100% dental coverage is legitimate and in my offer  
I need to get a least to the $20.00ish range  


What do you guys think about this whole thing? I know it's kinda scrambled together, but feel free to ask questions I will try to reply as much as I can. I have never had a full-time job before that did not have a full line of benefits so this is all new to me.

997,personalfinance,"Posting because although I've searched around and watched a good amount of personal finance videos, I've just been applying these principles to my own situation as a young person with no experience managing finances. Asked my parents for advice but they had some extremely conservative goals for me like ""save up and hold two years of living expenses in cash"". So basically wanted to see if anyone has any advice on what I could be doing better financially, from their perspective. Maybe I've already nailed it, in which case this is just a sanity check. Thanks in advance.

My situation:

24 y/o male, married. Partner is 23 (F)

Assets:

* 3k in a taxable brokerage, in an index fund
* 10k Roth IRA
* 10K 401K
* 10K in a HYSA (Emergency fund)
* 15k in short term treasury bonds

Debts:

* no student debt
* 13k 0 interest loans, monthly payment is about 1400. (FYI these are through American Express, which they used to promote their ""Pay Over Time"" feature).

Income:

230k a year. In case anyone cares what industry, I work biglaw and am a first year. My spouse is self employed so she has a greater potential for earning more, also runs a service based company with little to no overhead. She made about 70k in 9 months last year, but let's just count her income as 0 to keep things simple. We're planning on investing most of what she makes now into her business anyways.

My current plan:

* pretax maximum contribution to 401k (22,500 a year)
* maximum Roth IRA contribution (my employer does mega-backdoor, so 43,500 a year)
* Maximum spousal Roth IRA contribution (6,500 a year, this will probably have to be done backdoor this year)

Our total living expenses come out to like 60k a year including the 0 interest debt payment, which doesn't leave much left over (around 20K after tax?). Was planning to continue to buy treasuries as they are low risk and relatively liquid, maybe will buy a house at some point in the future if prices dip.

Any tips or advice in terms of optimizing? Our overall big picture strategy is for me to work this high-paying, low risk job while my wife takes on the bigger risk but also has more earning potential.

I’m a work from home contractor for a credit bureau. I live in New Mexico, my company is out of state if that matters? I’ve been in this position 1 year 3 months. I get paid $18/hr weekly. Every Thursday/Friday for the past year my check deposit has been exactly $558.64, on every paycheck, literally I have the stubs to prove it. It’s always exactly the same amount because I don’t have a time clock so in my time sheet every week it’s always the exact time I input, 40 hours down to the second. 

Here’s the problem:

Today my deposit was $458.76. I quickly logged onto my workstation and checked my paystub. Nothing has changed. Hourly rate $18/hr still the same. 40 hours worked. My tax withholding for fed and state however have all nearly doubled. For no reason? That’s where my extra $100 went. 

I contacted HR for an explanation and she said “sometimes taxes increase and that’s that.” So essentially I can kiss $400 a month ($5000 yearly) down the drain and now it’ll basically be like I took a pay cut and am working for $14/hr now because reasons?

How can this be?? Am I missing something? I’m no spring chicken and at no place I’ve ever worked at in the past has my take home pay been slashed at the start of the new year for seemingly no reason. 

No liens. No child support. No back taxes owed. No garnishments. Nothing like that at all.

1) buy a starter home and pay off in five years. Pros - I’m very risk averse and don’t want to over leverage, plus this gives mobility. 

2) buy a duplex and rent one side. I’ve have some friends have success with this and my partner is a licensed inspector and has been an individual property manager before. However, I’m very concerned about getting a bad tenant. Also, heaven forbid my partner and I break up and I’m not sure I want to be a landlord.

3) buy land to begin developing. I want to homestead one day, but my job keeps me in city areas for now. However, I really like the idea of buying something and working towards it as a forever home. Cons are lack of mobility, and I would still be renting.

1019,personalfinance,"Hi Reddit, I'm a first time home buyer running into some seriously weird issues with an HOA, and curious about the legality of some of the stunts they're pulling. I'm a veteran using the VA loan. Nothing has closed yet, but things are getting close enough to start worrying. Sorry for the long post, but there's a lot to question.

My partner and I are purchasing a condo unit in Chicago. We have already agreed to a price with the seller, our lender has approved the loan, the appraisal and inspection are both completed as well. When it came time to drop off some money orders to the front office, we started seeing some serious problems.

The building manager was great, up until we handed her the sales contract and the number for money down was still blank. Our lender told us to leave this blank for the time being, just so VA loan stuff could clear and it didn't need to be there until way closer to closing anyway. Here's where the fun starts:

The building manager asked what our ""loan to value"" was rather quickly and we were stumped, because as newbies, we aren't great with a lot of terms. We told her we were doing a VA loan, and she immediately snaps back with, ""oh, so do you have the 20 months of assessment fees available to pay?"" We had absolutely no idea what she was talking about and let her know that. She prints off page 22 and 23 of their 40 page HOA rulebook and shows us a clause buried in there where if you put down 0%, you owe 20 months of assessment fees. She did some quick math to show we would end up owing just shy of what a 10% down payment would look like.

She also included 2 parking spots and cable/internet. The parking spots are on a waitlist and we were like 8 spots down, so she pulled those numbers right out of thin air, and the cable/internet is already on the assessment fee and she listed it again. So I'm feeling like it's pretty obvious she's trying to scare us off.

It doesn't end there. She is also requesting we each file a credit report through a company they use, again, after we've already been through this with our lender/bank and received credit scores from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. I asked if they could just get this from our lender since it's already been done, and I was given a stern no, it has to be through this specific company. They gave us a number, an extension, ask for ""Name"". For what it's worth, both of our credit scores are very good. Certainly more than sufficient for this place.

They have also requested that the next HOA board meeting they have, that we meet them remotely so they can basically ""interview"" us and it sounds like they're going to approve us moving in.

The 20 months of assessment payments WERE provided in the HOA rulebook they gave us, but we didn't receive it at the beginning when we were discussing with the seller. It was also buried in an email with a total of 63 PDFs, only one of which was the rulebook. Everything else was just cover pages, meeting minutes, small potatoes and nothing-pages. No one except the HOA was aware of this 20 month assessment fee. Not us, our realtor, lawyer, lender, the seller, the seller's broker, the seller's lawyer, no one had a clue until we told them the building manager hit us with it and everyone is arguing this fee should have been front and center. Also, none of us (seller's side included) have ever heard of such a clause and we're all in agreement that it sounds absolutely insane.

Our lender told us to basically tell them to kick rocks on having our credit hit again for their report, as this is a pretty bad thing to do during a major purchase. If they want credit scores, they can get them from him if he even deems it necessary.

Our realtor suspects that ""voting in"" people in the building sounds like something a co-op does and doubts this is even legal. Our lawyer is looking into how they got around this being a form of discrimination.

So, I'm wondering if anyone has ever seen anything like this? How can we hack this apart? Is this stuff even legal? Even if we beat these fees, what are the odds the HOA just messes with us the entire time we're there? It isn't too late to back out and cut our losses, but it's getting way too close to let it go.

I’ve tried to research this question and couldn’t find the answer. My employer’s 401K allows for pre-tax, Roth, and after tax contributions with in-service withdrawal capabilities.

I typically max out my $22.5K 401K contributions, subtract employer match and contribute the rest after tax up to the (now) $66K limit.

If I could only afford to do one, I’d want to take advantage of the post tax contributions (and transfer to Roth IRA) given the better investment options, but have typically always maxed out so it was never an issue. I might be rethinking that this year and realized I wasn’t sure if you had to have $22.5K in 401K (pre-tax or Roth) contributed by year end to be allowed (by IRS etc.) to do after tax contributions or if it is okay to only / mostly do after tax.","Do I have to do $22.5K in 401K contributions by end of year to do a mega backdoor Roth?

I’ve been preapproved for a loan through Carvana, with a decent, but not great interest rate. This was not a hard enquiry and the rate quoted to me was described as a “minimum rate”, meaning once they actually check my numbers it could increase (I have good credit, 740s, but it’s not immaculate). 

I have a checking and savings account through Big Bad American Bank, and there are three credit unions in my town, but no “in” through my employer. I believe they are all open to the public.

So, how do I shop for a loan?

I’m open to moving everything to a credit union, but I don’t know how to choose one - is it simply who offers me the lowest interest rate (assuming other benefits are on par with what I have/expect)?

Then, what is the order of operations for staking a claim on the car, agreeing to a loan, going to the “store” and taking possession? (They can deliver the car to me but I feel weird about buying it sight unseen; store is 1hr away). Does the credit Union issue me a check, or is there some process done at the store with my account number?

Some background information: In 2020 my then girlfriend (now wife) and I moved to a college town for my PhD program, and rented an apartment which we still live in.

I'm not exactly opposed, but from browsing this sub for a while, I'm hesitant.

On average students complete my program in 5-6 years, of which I'm in the middle of my third. I don't think this is enough time to build any sort of equity in a home, but can't cite any actual terminology or numbers.

Usually I use this bonus to get ahead on bills, max out simple IRA, put some money in stocks, and for home improvements. This year, after maxing out my IRA I netted roughly $45k, which I was planning to use for a badly needed renovation. Unfortunately, my HVAC unit also bit the dust this week, which will be $5500 to repair. 

I was already nervous putting all of the money into the kitchen, given it would not leave me with much liquid savings for emergencies, and now with the HVAC expense I don’t think I will have enough to do the kitchen. My kitchen cabinets are falling apart so I really don’t want to wait another year to do the renovation and I want to knock out a wall/change the footprint as part of the renovation, so I kind of need to do it all at once. 

We don’t have any debt aside from my husband and my car notes (and my mortgage), but I have money already set aside to pay those monthly payments for the year. I pay off my credit cards in full every month. Our parents are also well off, so if we were to ever fall on some really hard times they would help us out if needed. 

So with all of this being said, I had an idea that I could open up a new credit card with a 0% intro APR to pay for the HVAC and some of the home renovation cost, pay the minimum balance during the year, and then pay off the card in full with my next annual bonus (which should be around the same amount or more).

Is there any reason this would be a bad idea? I have never not paid my credit cards in full, so using a card like this would definitely be new to me. The only problem I am anticipating is that I may not be able to pay for the home improvement expenses with a credit card, but in this case I would just put more of my regular household expenses on that 0% APR card (and still pay it off at the end of the year).",Should I put home renovation costs on new credit card?,1672952790

We're financially comfortable enough to absorb the tax bill; it means that a lot of money we'd been putting towards savings (IRA, etc) would instead go to property taxes. 

If we assume ownership as individuals, we can get a pretty substantial rebate on the tax bill since it's our primary residence, but that would involve dissolving the LLC. I'm not sure what the tax implications of that are.

I should also note that we love where we live; we're planning on being here at least for the next 5-10 years. It's a bit on the small side, and we're always looking for more space, but we really do love it here.

1069,personalfinance,"Hello everyone. I'm a self employed gig economy worker that just hit 2 years of continuous full time 1099 work. I don't make a lot of money, but I make enough to get by. Luckily I have a wonderful fiance who splits expenses with me.

Yesterday we went to my local credit union to open a new account, and we decided to try refinancing our 2018 Chevy Cruze that is in both of our names. Our credit scores are 'fair' at around 620. I very recently all but paid off a $1,000 credit card, so likely my score is higher.

Anyways, everything seemed to have checked out. They pulled our credit, and said they need proof of income, insurance cards, registration, etc. I informed the bank that I did not yet file for 2022 yet, so I do not have 2 solid years of self employment income to report yet. They said that's okay, and so after submitting my 2021 and 2020 returns, they told me that my income is not enough to refinance.

In 2020 I believe I made around $20,000 because I still had a W2 job for about 2 months. I also own an LLC that I've operated since 2016 which turns a profit of about $2-$4k a year. Surely my 1099 work yields at least $13,000 or so a year.

But now that I'm looking at my numbers from 2022, it appears as though my 1099 work only yielded about $12k, I'm not positive though considering Shipt deactivated me in March 2022 and I have no access to those earnings until they send me a 1099. I'd estimate that with Shipt I made around $14,000 last year altogether excluding my LLC.

My concern is that I have tried to do 2 years of continuous self employed work because mortgage lenders typically need 2 years of tax returns to determine whether or not I can get a house. I learned this about a year ago, so I was 1 year in and figured I'd keep going with the self employment since I was already halfway there.

Even with my fiance's full time W2 income accounted for and her credit score, they wouldn't even let us refinance a car. Do we have a chance at even getting a mortgage on a cheap $20k-$30k trailer? Or did I essentially waste 2 years of my time? Would our chances of being able to get a home increase once our credit scores go up? As I mentioned earlier my credit card was paid off, but I didn't really give any time for the bureau to update my score, which in hindsight I probably should have.

Common sense tells me that a mortgage should be much different than an auto loan to be approved for, considering mortgages have much longer terms of 15/30 years. We also plan on using our tax refunds to put as a down payment. Perhaps I'm worrying too much? I'm not sure though.

1098,personalfinance,"So I just graduated college at 26 after leaving the army and I just got my first real job last November.  It pays $72k a year ($2200 after tax/ 2 wks).  I’ve created a budget, and would like some insight on if this seems reasonable.

$4400 after two paychecks (usually a month) 
With that:

$4400
-$800 rent
-$600 savings
-$600 401k (50% match up to 4%)
-$1000 personal brokerage investments 
-$120 groceries
-$160 gas
-$170 other expenses (utilities, internet, etc)

= $950 left over/ 2
= ~$500 of fun money every two weeks

Note: I also get paid ~$500 every month for my army reserve training I still do, so that usually bumps my second net income of the month to ~$1000 of unaccounted for funds.

I’m 26, I’ve got a paid off car, living in a great, yet cheap apartment with my girlfriend, a 725 credit score and only about $200 of debt across 3 credit cards with a total credit limit of $16,000.

My wife and I are planning to file for divorce this month.

Afterwards, we'll file our taxes for the year of 2022. During that tax year we were still together, so would it be smarter to file married, filed jointly?

Currently, my wife is the only person that makes the money. I'm unemployed due to a medical condition and haven't been working for 5 months now. I don't want to file together with her if that means we'll both have to split the tax cost.

1105,personalfinance,"Hi PF community,

I am having an issue that I'm not sure how to resolve. 

In May of last year, I opened a zero-interest card from Wells Fargo to pay down my credit card debt. I'm recently graduated and finally have a healthy salary, so I'm trying to improve my financial health.

Having been a longtime lurker in this sub, I want to add for the record - I have never missed a credit card payment, I spend less than I earn, and I don't use this card at all. 

Now, here's the problem: Although I have a balance on my WF card of nearly $5,000 that I'm paying the minimum on each month, the funds were never actually dispersed to the credit card it was intended to pay off. WF has the correct card number and I've spoken to them \*many\* times over the last eight months, and still nothing. They just keep kicking it to a different office. The first time I spoke with them, they told me it would be a three-month investigation process. Eight months later, there's been no resolution -- and they haven't even tried to contact me. 

Today, I spoke with the executive office and they couldn't find a complaint. They did give me a case number long ago, but I didn't have it on me. After some research, they found that my complaint was never escalated to the appropriate office. So, not only have I had an additional $5k in debt on my credit report for the last eight months (which is obviously affecting my credit), they've completely mishandled this issue and I don't even know whether they've done any research or attempted to resolve this issue.

What should I do in this situation? I don't know who to ask because I'm embarrassed that I'm just starting to get my life on track financially at 32 (please be kind!). So I turn to you folks to provide any insight you have. Is it possible to just have WF cancel this debt? Or how should I approach this?

kindly,

1106,personalfinance,"Hello Everyone!

My wife and I are purchasing a house for the first time. We have 3 different mortgage options and we're looking for pro/cons on a few of them.

The house we are buying is $295k and we are putting 10% down.

Loan 1: 5.25% 30yr with a balloon payoff at 10yrs. PMI requires 15% Equity (rather than the standard 20%) and they are offering a HELOC to cover the last 5% down payment, so we wouldn't have any PMI.

Loan 2: Same lender as Loan one but is a 6.5% 30yr. PMI requires 15% equity and we can have a HELOC for the last 5% down payment, so no PMI.

Loan 3: 5.875% 30yr mortgage. PMI is est. $150/mth.

&amp;#x200B;

Not taking in account any early payoff / extra principal payments, the total cost of the loan would be:  
Loan 1: $522K  
Loan 2: $594K  
Loan 3: $541K

If we take in account early payoff (and paying the same amount on each loan each month, so once PMI is gone, that amount goes into extra principal payments), the total cost of the loan would be:  
Loan 1: $435K  
Loan 2: $551K  
Loan 3: $450K

Loan 2 clearly isn't the best option (no PMI doesn't offset the interest rate difference).

Loan 1 is the cheapest (lowest interest rate and no PMI) but it comes with the additional risk that if we don't refinance or move, we're stuck paying off the remaining balance in a balloon payment, but we get a low interest rate. Its also the loan that we would pay off the quickest.

Is the balloon loan a bad idea because of the added risk? Other people that have I consulted with have pretty mixed opinions.",Mortgage: Low Interest w/No PMI Balloon?,1672945062

I decided to start bartending at a hotel part time but I only make about $1100 a month and I have a private student loan (bc I had to take an extra year to graduate) that I am currently paying which is $500 a month.  Luckily I live with my parents so I don't have to pay for rent but as you can imagine it doesn't leave me much to save after other expenses.  

I've been working on a startup making a mobile app for the past year, seriously ramping up progress even more since I stopped applying to software engineer jobs in August.  I fully believe in what I'm doing but I've just hit a wall.

I was never smart with money. the past few years I’ve been trying to fix the mess I’ve made ( I spent money as fast as I made it on nothing but crap, racked up CC debt etc). I stopped buying things and have paid off all my credit cards last year and bought a house. 

I make roughly $130k a year and am able to save 30-40k a year after taxes. I am a real estate agent on the side. 

My unions retirement sucks (belong to a union as a mariner). I’ve been in my union 6 years and only have 1.3 years of credit towards my retirement (I need to actively sail to get days towards retirement; ex: if I sail 4 months and have 3 months off the 3 off don’t count). 

My union does not offer a 401k. Only certain contracts within the union do and they are insanely hard to get. 

I have a house and by end of 2023 will have about 100k of equity. I started an IRA that I am making out every year. 

I’d like to leverage my equity into investments but have no idea whether I should put the $ into stocks/mutual funds/index funds or if I should buy some rental real estate or maybe try to do both? 

I’ve been researching and self educating but I’m at the point of information overload and am incredibly overwhelmed. 

I have a wife and 2 kids (2 years old and 10 months old). My wife does not work. I need to be able to retire for my wife and myself as well as put two kids through college in roughly 18 years. 

In the next 10-15 years I’d like to be in a position that I am not reliant on my career as a mariner. I am not saying I’d quit I just don’t want to be in this position where I am forced to work.  

I do recognize I am very fortunate compared to many who live paycheck to paycheck but I’d like to make a good situation better to be able to provide for my family.

1149,personalfinance,"Hi all, forgive my formatting in advance, I am on mobile.
 
I am 22F and have been at my current job out of college for just under a year, was making 50k and just got a raise to 58k. No debt. I live in a 1 br apt with my partner in a HCOL city. He works freelance in the film arena, and his income varies, so I feel the most comfortable making financial choices like housing with the assumption that I can pay everything on just my income, though he is usually able to contribute about 30% of household expenses. He could be doing more, but as my income is more stable, this has been what I have been the most comfortable with until this point.
 
Presently do not have a strict budget but I know I need to work that out. This last year was somewhat of an experiment as my partner quit his job in March to go freelance, and like I said, I did not want to count on his income to pay our bills, but now that we have gotten a clearer picture of his earning capabilities, I feel more comfortable relying on him for his income.
 
At this point my fixed costs are:

- $1,100 rent (Will be moving in July to something around $1600, where I live now is extremely unsafe and this is nonnegotiable).

- $250 car payment
- $100 utilities
- $200 gas
- $33 gym membership
- $760 6 mo car insurance premium that happens to be up for renewal this month (shopped around and unfortunately cannot find anything lower)
 
Whatever is left over I do spend frivolously, but I pay my CCs off in full monthly, though I am ready to sit down and build a budget. I guess I come to you all asking what can I be doing better, and am I super far behind? Any advice for budgeting?

I know the most obvious answer is save as much as possible and build a proper budget. I don’t need to look at the bank statements to know that most of my spending is on takeout, but I am currently learning to cook so that should be steadily falling. I know I absolutely have to decrease my spending to supplement the increase in my housing costs when the time comes. 

I have been feeling bad about my spending because I know it has been careless when my partner is able to contribute 50% to rent, I just blow that money. Again, I have no debt, but I am worried I am behind financially in terms of savings and retirement. 
 
As of now I am investing 10% of my income into a Roth 401k, and 1% into a traditional pretax 401k at the insistence of my parents – my mother feels like she is being screwed by having to pay enormous taxes on her traditional 401 not that she is retired, but I have seen on here that a Roth 401k isn’t always the right choice. 

Honestly, I am a secretary and honestly do not see my income in my lifetime go above 100k, but I am young and who knows where I will end up. No employer 401k match, but I believe after I have been with the company 2 years I receive a contribution at a percentage of my salary. That said, between those two accounts I have currently contributed around $2800. 

I also have an HSA with $2200 in it as of now, and pledged $3600 to that account this year, with a $700 employer contribution. I have about $2600 in a savings account as an emergency fund. 

I know I should open a Roth IRA, but I am not really clear on how that works. My employer 401k is through Vanguard, can I just open the account there, or would it be wiser to open an entirely new account through Charles Schwab? Am I in bad shape currently, and if so, what changes need to be made?

1153,personalfinance,"Hello personalfinanciers! I have always enjoyed the advice and insights from this sub and find myself in a place where I’m finally able to take stock of where I’m at and think a bit more long term about the future. And could really use some advice. 

First, some high level details:

Gross monthly: $8900

Monthly expenses:
-Rent: $767 (live with my partner in a shared home with friends)
-Home savings account: $1,116 (20% of net monthly)
-Utilities: ~$100
-Pension contribution: $575
-Roth IRA: $542 (yearly maximum)
-Car payment: $558 (more on this later)
-Car insurance: $114
-Phone bill: $72
-Vacation savings: $200
-Credit card: $2000*

*I treat my credit card like a debit card. I never carry a balance and always pay off my charges monthly. I group all other monthly expenses onto my credit card spending (like groceries, nights out, gym, shopping, etc). It gives me some peace of mind and flexibility so i’m not being too fastidious on every category. 

Assets:
-Index fund total: ~$15k
-Roth IRA: ~$17k
-Emergency fund: $17k (this covers the  basics like rent, utilities, and car payment for 6 months m)
-Home savings account: $7k
-Vacation account: $4k

Some context: I was finishing a PhD for all of my 20s (before PhD worked a canvassing job that paid shit). During my PhD, I made ~$30k/year. I started to save what I could in my Roth IRA starting in 2017, and managed to pay off all my undergrad student debt (about $38k) over the course of my grad studies (pretty proud of that!) The only debt i now have is my car payment, which I share with my partner. Our total monthly car payment is $810/mo at 2.94% interest. We have an agreement where we both contribute 10% of net pay, or $600/month, whichever is lesser. The rest of those contributions/money get rolled over into a joint savings account to be used for car related expenses. We own an electric vehicle so car maintenance should be low. 

In March of last year, I accepted a job at a state agency in WA where my salary was $80k. In October, a truly dream job opened in local city government doing what I focused my PhD on, and came with a $30k raise and better benefits. So really a win-win-win. Lots of room for advancement and I should max out my current classification in 2 years, which is a 4.5% raise/year. 

I’ve realized that - in part growing up working class and having a pathologically frugal father, and in part being a low-income earning graduate student - I am still living in a kind of “poverty mentality” where I have psychologically caught up to my new salary and spending power. I feel guilty taking vacations or indulging in myself, or like even the simple things like buying cocktails instead of well drinks when i go out every now and then. 

I live in a HCOLA and I would like to buy a house. I think i’m on track to do that in the next 5 years. While my partner and i aren’t married, I imagine we might be in the next few years (I can’t imagine life without him at this point). We don’t plan to have kids. 

How should I be shuffling my budget around? What should I do with my yearly raises? Promotions (very likely)? What should be some of my medium and long term goals?

1154,personalfinance,"TLDR at the bottom. 

I opened a new credit card to take advantage of a balance transfer promotion last year. I did 2 separate balance transfers, 1 at 0% interest and another at 6% interest (which was way better than the 26% I had been paying). I have been paying over 1k per month on a $180 minimum payment to get this paid off by the end of the promotional period. The 0% interest period ends 3/23 and the 6% interest period ends 10/23. 

What I just found out is that my payment does not apply to the transfer with the first promotional end date. It applies to the higher interest first. There is no way that I can make a payment directly to a balance transfer and I do not have the total remaining at this time to pay off. It is only 8k but unfortunately I just don't have it right now and won't have it before March. 

I would really like to avoid paying the 26% interest that is going to hit on that balance. I have great credit and am considering taking a low interest personal loan to pay that off and avoid high interest but my husband does not think this is a good idea to open another line of credit for that debt. 

We just bought a house and won't need a new car for over a year so I am not incredibly concerned about this affecting future large purchases or overall credit score. 

So, what is the best option for me here, taking the interest hit or trying to pay out the total balance with a new line of credit and taking on a lower interest for the total amount? Any advice on what I should consider is appreciated. 

TLDR: I misunderstood how balance transfer payments were working and am about to get hit with 26% interest on 3k.

1178,personalfinance,"Hello everyone, happy new year.

I'm financial novice so I got myself into a messy situation with my ROTH IRA, that I started to contribute to in Vanguard in 2021. Some bullet points below on my situation for easier read

* 2021: Higher bonuses and low 401k contributions, resulted in a $140k AGI (my salary then was $123k) so only a partial contribution was available to me. I filed only recently (so very late) for the excess contribution so that's a hard pill to sallow for the 6% penalty but I'll be learning for that mistake
* 2022: New job with exactly $125k salary and maxed out 401k, so I'm hopefully anticipating my AGI would be lower that I could have contributed the full ROTH (question on this line of thinking below) but I will possibly have to recharacterize or withdraw
* 2023: Contributed a small chuck to my ROTH IRA already
* ROTH IRA Backdoor was not used in any of these situations

Hopefully the above points makes sense essentially, I am in the partial contribution range and will need to be more careful about how I contribute to my ROTH IRA. Some questions I have are:

* Am I thinking about my AGI correctly in that contributions to my 401k should help reduce my AGI so I could be eligible for the $6k ROTH IRA contribution (not counting the backdoor method)?
   * If so, should I wait for my W2 to start calculating my AGI?
* Lastly, with the portion I already contributed to my ROTH IRA for 2023, should I just go ahead and recharacterize that all to a Traditional IRA (I haven't purchased stocks) and go for a ROTH IRA backdoor from now on?

Any other thoughts on my situation are greatly appreciated. I'm pretty disappointed in myself for the negligence I had in managing my ROTH IRA account but am will to learn to my mistake and hopefully be better in the future.

1183,personalfinance,"I max out my Roth IRA (via Backdoor) and 401k (Traditional) every year. I used to work for a company where after-tax contributions were not allowed, so I stowed away some extra saved money in a regular taxable brokerage with Fidelity. I put in about $20,000, though with market conditions this account is now worth about $16,500.

My new employer does allow for after-tax 401k contributions and although I probably won't have a ton of extra money, I'd like to take advantage of any tax benefits I can. 

My thought is to sell my entire brokerage account, harvest the loss on taxes, then ""live off"" the $16,500 for the next few months while putting almost my entire paycheck into my 401k through traditional (as normal) and then after-tax with the in-plan conversion to Roth. I'd do this for a few months until I had about that $16-20K in the Roth portion.

Since I'm basically a long term set-and-forget investor, something feels bad about selling stock at a loss that I know would recover, but if I'm not taking it as cash and re-investing into similar holdings (total market index funds) I guess it's all the same.

* Is this a good plan? Any unexpected complications to be aware of? 
* Would wash sale rules apply? If I sold out the brokerage account would I need to wait to buy in through a different account with different rules? 

I also have a kiddo and a 529, I could just move the $16,500 directly into there. I wasn't planning on front-loading his college fund like this, but it would be a simpler way of making sure that currently taxable money ends up being non-taxable after growth, while still capturing some losses this year.

I had a small 30 day missed payment on an account about a year ago (death in the family at the time it was suppsoed to be paid/thought it was on autopay), and decided to just take a long shot and write a goodwill letter and just see if it could get removed. I know the odds of it being granted was low, but figured it doesn't hurt.

Apparently, I was wrong? I saw my score tanked about 25 points and when I looked at the updates, it had the note ""Consuner disputes this account Information - Account previously in dispute now resolved by data furnisher"". At first I thought this was a promising remark, but given the reflected change in credit score, and the fact that the missed payment is still there, I'm thinking it's not. 

It seems there was some kind of misunderstanding, since I wasn't trying to dispute (and from my understanding- goodwill letters aren't a formal dispute). I made it pretty clear in my letter I was accepting the balance as my own, and the reasoning for the missed payment. Is this normal? Should I contact the credit bureau/ creditor and explain it wasn't a formal dispute and just s good will letter? Or is this just part of the process with good will letters?

Two years ago I had some mental health issues and for whatever reason I signed up for untold amounts of subscription based services during this time and stopped monitoring my spending. I usually put everything on my credit cards and at some point my credit card was put on lockdown by the credit card company because apparently the auto payments I had setup were bouncing back. So many of the recurring bills weren't going through. I had no idea or at least I wasn't paying attention.

Anyways over the last six months I paid off those cards, and started noticing all these bills from a ton of companies hitting the card. I did my best to go through my credit card activity, identify, and cancel all the recurring transactions I didn't need, because all those recurring bills started to hit my card once it was unlocked. There was probably 15+ recurring subscriptions that were hitting my card. A few I have literally not been able to locate the sign in info for the accounts I used to purchase the subs and I have been having to call the companies and spend hours on the phone while they attempt to locate the account that's billing my card.

1205,personalfinance,"Hi all, I’m trying to decide how to allocate into tax advantaged accounts this year and could use some help.

My employer offers a SEP-IRA.
They contribute to it each pay check, but I cannot make any contributions to it. I wouldn’t say it’s insignificant, but I only get just over $100 contributed per month. There is a talk that they may change over to a 401k, but I don’t know when this will happen and if it will be this year.

I am over the income limit to contribute to a Roth IRA. And due  to the SEP-IRA, doing a backdoor Roth IRA conversion leaves me subject to the pro rata rule.

What would you do in this situation? Should I wait to see if a 401k will be offered and if it is, get rid of SEP and do a backdoor conversion then? Should I contribute to a traditional IRA and scrap the idea of a backdoor conversion this year? Or do I do a backdoor conversion now and risk being open to pro rata at the end of the year (does it ever make sense to do this?)? Are there other options I’m not considering?

1207,personalfinance,"TIA for the help:

The information: Purchased a home last fall. Purchase price: $120k with $12k down. I took out a $160k mortgage at 5.25% as the house is in need of renovations. Monthly payment is $795. After closing costs, etc., the bank gave me a $24k check earmarked for said renovations. I had a family member give me $10k, leaving me with $34k in a savings account specifically for home renovations. My regular savings account currently has $15k.

Normally, I’d fund my investments via that $15k account. However, I haven’t yet as I’m undecided between doing just that and potentially needing it for my home renos. 

I’ve done much of the renovation myself thus far. However, I’ll soon have to bring outside contractors in for a small bath renovation and a kitchen renovation, hang new doors, trim, and a few minor things. Still need to buy appliances, cabinets, doors. 

My renovations account is currently sitting at $25,750, after I’ve purchased electrical materials, paint, flooring, etc.

I’m 29m, my base salary is $66k, am expecting $5-10k in OT this year but don’t want to rely on it. My job is pretty secure. No other debts. Just backed my 401k off to 15% versus the 25% it was at. Its balance is currently $22k. My Roth is at $16.5k, HSA - $6.2k, Rollover - $11.2k.


Apologies for this being a mumbled, structureless mess. In a bit of a hurry and just looking for some advice from those smarter than I. Would you take out more on your mortgage to fund the remaining renovations - to ensure funding your Roth and HSA? Or would you hold off on funding and try to leave mortgage as-is? - at the risk of not funding those accounts?

i made around $2,500 from a w-2 job, which i will obviously get a form for later. but most of my income was from self-employment in which i made around $19,583 this year from. i do not think i will even get taxed additionally from my w-2 job because i did not make enough in that job. 

this is the current math:

* As of right now, 19,583.50x0.9235= 18,085.36 is self-employment taxable income (without deductions and expenses)
   * Self employment tax rate: 18,085x0.153= 2,767.06
* As of right now, I made a net of less than 2,500, so earned income is less than standard deduction (approximately 12,000)

First, thank you in advance for all the generous and thoughtful responses.

I am 25 years old and currently a student with no source of income. My school disallows students from working their first semester of school. Though, I can work starting this semester. 

I have  about $18k in credit card debt from four cards. All cards have interest rates around 20%. These cards were taken out in 2019 to assist family during an extremely distressing time. I have made every minimum payment excluding December 2022 where I ran out of money due to law school living expenses. 

Also, I have and will continue to incur student loan debt for law school expenses. I estimate to have around $180k in law school debt by the time I graduate in 2025. I have no undergraduate debt or car loan debt. 

I am currently a law student at a T-14 school where I am supporting myself through grants given by the law school and federal student loans. I comfortably took out the loans knowing that top law school graduates, with hard work and perseverance, can attain jobs at private law firms making around $200k their first year. My long term career plan is to 
work at a big law firm to pay off debt and then return to my home state to serve as a public defender. 

I would need to earn $1,000-$1,500 a month to meet the monthly payments and my immediate reaction is just to get a job but am wondering if …

Instead of working a part-time job in law school and losing time toward professor relationship development, independent research, and networking —should I declare bankruptcy now? 

If I work a part-time job, I won’t have time to join a journal, be involved in affinity groups, participate in moot court AND still make time to study diligently to get the best grades possible to maximize my employment outcomes.

I'm an 18 year old male and I have a lot of business ideas that I want to try, but I'm having trouble getting started. I need to earn the first few thousand dollars to get things off the ground, but I just can't seem to make it happen.

I've tried a few different things, but nothing seems to be working. I know I should get a job and go that route but I have proof of concept with my ideas and really struggle with the idea of getting a job.

I don't view myself as lazy or undisciplined. I get at least an hour of exercise a day, I eat well, and I love working on entrepreneurial things. I just cannot get the first few K's to get started with anything serious. This is slowly making my parents grow bitter as I am now 6 months into being 18 and still haven't got a job or gone to college.

How would you recommend I get started? Is there side hustles I can do to earn the $3-4k or should I force myself to get a job? What advice do you have for someone like me who is struggling to get started?

I was very lucky that the thieves were scared off by my neighbor and left the scene after breaking a window. I got a steering wheel lock to deter future thieves but I am still concerned about more break-ins and higher insurance premiums and lower resale value.

Right now I'm living paycheck to paycheck until I manage to get over the hump of late Rent payments once I'm steadily working. I had a job at Amazon from Aug up until Nov before I resigned. I had taken a 1.5 month LOA for Mental Health reasons which led to manic spending, constant buying of food/drinks via Postmates, and loss of payments from SDI because my Dr. Said they weren't in the system and we didn't have all the right records and paperwork since I had contacted her way too late into the LOA. So I lost around $2500 of income due to that. Once I came back to work I ended up feeling physically incapable and mentally incapable of continuing working there with all this money due here and there looming over me, losing money to Ubers to work since it was far away from me, and just not feeling the right support from coworkers saying I'm just trying to not work and all that despite all my issues, mental, physical, or otherwise. I was physically hurting myself everyday at work to the point of near incapacitation once home. It was just like stress overload.

So during all this I ended up forgoing any payments to credit accounts due to either being too broke or focusing solely on rent and borrowed money from friends/family. I had a chronic spending problem putting most of my credit towards my gaming PC and its upgrades, a gaming laptop, a new phone, another new phone, a new E-Bike i never used because in my area none of the apps support it for delivery purposes and because of that mental health problem and low physical health I never got around to using it for any reason (I'm now selling it), lots of foods, snacks, drinks, and just anything that kept me any form of entertainment. Everything piled up, late fees, interest, etc. Until it was too much for me.

I've thought of Bankruptcy but I'm not entirely sure how to go through that and what it entails. I'm in CA if that makes any difference. I'm now working at Walmart as mentioned making $17/hr and just recently on Dec 17 and on Dec 23 contracted COVID from work and had to take a COVID Leave which I'm just now getting off of and can return to work on the 6th according to my doctor. I got paid for 4 scheduled work days + 4 days of COVID which amounted to around $950 after taxes and some of that went to automatic payments towards my Moneylion Loan, MoneyLion Instacash Advance, and some other Advance Apps as well as a Dr Appointment, Uber rides, and some light groceries leaving me with around $600. And I currently owe $750 Rent for Dec + $100 Utilities, $75 Late Fee, $750 Rent for Jan, and upcoming receipt of my Utilities due on the 15th. 

Thankfully I worked with my landlord and can pay them when I get my next paycheck in 2 weeks which should hopefully be a lot bigger this time around since it will include some of my COVID Pay and more work days. However I've also looked at Rental Assistance in the off chance I can get assistance for coverage instead of deleting my entire paycheck in one go just to live here.

So what now? How do I go about repairing my situation and raising my score? I uses to have a 760-780 score back when I was /r/churning and didn't even have a job at the time and ended up with super high limit cards with Amex. Though they ended up lowering them severely when I put them under a payment plan and they never reverted it once I canceled the payment plan. If I had all 3 cards at full credit I could have basically put all my other debt combined into just those 3 cards and even my main Chase card before they cut that limit too.

However, the builder’s incentive was pretty good imo so we decided to pull the trigger. It’s a 2023 new built in a location that we like to be in. 30 yrs fixed @ 4.99%, they give us $13,000 to pay for closing cost (which should cover all of it);  appliances also included for free (approx. $5000 in value). With that said, our out-of-pocket is expected to only be the 5% down payment.

I estimated to have around $140k in equity in my current house (calculated by subtracting what I owe versus what Zillow estimates). My realtor said that we could get $2000/ month by renting it out, which would net us $600 cash flow monthly.

I also have an auto loan which is $380 a month. I live in one apartment, and rent out the other for $1000 a month. They're both 3 bedroom apartments. The house needs a ton of work but no bank will give me a home equity loan because I'm self employed (DoorDash) and my taxable income comes up as $0 even though I make around $2800 a month on average which is completely retarded because they were willing to give me an unsecured loan with that very same income. Right now I'm heavily focused on paying off the $5k credit card, but from there I'm not sure what to do next. Should I focus on paying off the personal loan or should I make the regular payments while trying to save cash to make repairs? One thing I was thinking of doing is paying off the loan then get another personal loan to make a few repairs, pay that off, get another one, etc. or is there a way around these retarded laws that make it almost impossible to get a mortgage/home equity loan if you're self employed.","Just bought a fixer upper, I don't even know where to start...",1672894878

As the title suggests, I screwed up big on my ROTH IRA contributions from 2021 as I revisited my 2021 filing and discovered my AGI was $140k so I was only eligible for a partial contribution. I understand now I am well past the deadline and would be subject to the 6% tax penalty which is per year so long the excess remains in the ROTH IRA. Some questions I was hoping to get guidance for:

* From Vanguard, do I  recharacterize the contribution or simply remove it?
* Is the 6% per year tax penalty based on when the excess contribution was made or at the start of the calendar year?
* Do I have to do the net income calculation for returned or recharacterized IRA contributions? I read on greenbushfinancial that I don't but I'm not sure how reputable that is since the calculation is cited across many excess contribution references.
   * greenbushfinanicial quote: ""If you remove the excess contribution AFTER the tax deadline, you do not have to pay taxes or penalties on the EARNINGS portion because you are not required to distribute the earnings, but you pay a flat 6% penalty per year based on the actual excess contribution amount.""

Our 2012 Subaru Forest unfortunately has blown a head gasket. This is the second used car in three years to need a new engine. This time around, the warranty/service contract was sooo close to covering the fix, but I would be responsible for the $2,000 engine tear down to even confirm that it is something covered under the warranty. If it ended up being covered- great but, that's still $2,000 more I'm in the hole as opposed to $3,000 to just get it fixed out of pocket.

So, we're looking at trading toward something else. I've never bought a new car before, and I'm pretty tired of being burned by used purchases.

Is it foolish for a financially struggling person to buy a new car? I've always felt like new car = luxury item, but having learned of the 100% warranty coverage I'm considering this option for the first time.

 I understand as long as you keep up with the service schedule, every single thing you could think of (except windshield damage, wrecks, and external factors) would be covered and paid for by the warranty for the first 5 years at which point it switches  to a 3rd party lifetime warranty.

 I cannot handle finding myself in this situation again in a year or two years.

The payment's looking like $400 more a month than I'm currently paying which, if I follow my budget, should result in still saving (but considerably less per month). I still owe about $6,000 on the Subaru, so couple that with the need of a new engine, and you can see how trading it in gets me peanuts for it.

Between my last two used car purchases, I've honestly spent enough on service and repairs for a pretty sizable down payment on something new.

And of course, if I go this route, expenses are going to have to cut waaaay back.

It's not really a question of **can I do it**, more so - is it a smart move in the long run?

I have a Rollover IRA from a previous employer, the account was initially setup as a Traditional 401k, it is not of significant value. I made my 6k contributions in 2022 bringing it to under 15k. My mistake being that I assumed an IRA was an IRA, when in fact I believe I should have put my 6k last year into a Roth IRA. This year I will be getting married and our combined income will be over the \~250k Roth contribution limit.

If I understand this correctly, I can continue to contribute to my Rollover IRA, but I am now not able to setup and contribute to a Roth IRA due to combined income?

I am aware of, but somewhat unclear on the backdoor option, and not sure if it’s something I should pursue? I could convert my Rollover to a Roth, but that will come at a significant tax cost given our combined income? Could I alternatively add the 6.5k to my Rollover and then covert that to a Roth IRA without a tax hit? Should I avoid all that and just keep submitting to my Rollover?

3. Am I better off just sticking with Progressive for the remainder of the term (6 months) and switching when it's closer to renewal?

1383,personalfinance,"I reported a debit card as lost recently, but an old subscription service that I used to use was still able to charge against that card even after I had reported the card as lost. I was pretty surprised by this, but apparently this happens to people fairly often.

I can understand why banks have this, and I understand that this may be seen as a benefit for some (maybe even most) people; but, I personally hate it. In fact, the reason that I reported the debit card as lost was solely because I didn't want that old subscription service to be able to charge me anymore. I don't use that subscription service anymore, and they won't let me delete my debit card information from my account without adding new credit/debit card information.

The debit card in this situation was issued by Chase, and I do all of my other banking through Chase. And I noticed that other people who had this issue were also Chase customers. Thus, I'm wondering:

Do other banks have this issue, or is this just Chase? Is there a bank that I can sign up with that will prevent merchants from charging against a cancelled debit or credit card?

If all other banks suffer from this issue, what options do we have for cutting off subscription services that are difficult to cancel?

Finally, I know that going to the merchant to cancel the subscription is supposed to always be an option; but some subscription services, like the New York Times for example, will only cancel your subscription if you call into customer service. Fuck that! I would much rather click a button on my bank account to have them send me a new card and have the old one cancelled. Better yet, I would love a button on my bank account that could just cut off a merchant without even needing to get a new card.

- spend my time grocery shopping, prepping meals and cleaning up.

1389,personalfinance,"Hello all,

I just turned 26 some months ago and have gone through roughly 3 years of irresponsible spending due to getting my first higher paying job, me being me, the COVID pandemic, and depression which I am now getting treated. 

This past 2022 was the 3rd, and I want it to be the final, year that I completely wipe out my bank account at the end of the year due to poor planning. I'm tired of it and really want to start buckling down. Even though I'm 26, I feel like I'm 22/23 financially if that makes sense lol.

My weekly take home pay is 868.37 which is 3475.48 monthly

I currently pay 700 in rent. I have a really awesome housemate who makes quite a bit more than me and decided to split the rent fairly as opposed to evenly, which I really appreciate. I do live in California, so rent is definitely on the high side, and I'm not banking on living with my housemate forever. We both gotta live our lives, even if it requires moving out, which is also a motivator for getting my shit together.

I try to save 500 monthly, and I was doing a pretty good job last year until depression really hit, and I just wrecked everything so I'm starting from nearly 0.

As far as payments go, I've been tackling CC debt which is around 7K and expect to have it paid off by the end of the year. I have 35.5K in student loans and while I qualify for Biden's forgiveness program, I'm absolutely not banking on that since it seems unlikely it will happen. I'm not focusing on putting money into that and instead I want to use the remainder of the payment pause to clear as many CCs as possible.

The rest of my monthly payments including utilities and subscriptions total around 400 - 500. I'm currently rounding up all subscriptions and closing any I don't need and switching the ones I can to yearly payments since they're cheaper and eliminate annoying monthly payments. 

My goal for this year is to pay off all my CC debt while figuring out how to save money and where to put it which is what I mainly need help with. I mostly have the CC repayment figured out. 

I have 4 CCs  with significantly lower balances, so I'm starting off with a snowball method and once those are done (I actually already have two paid off!) I will switch to avalanche for the rest, since they're pretty much maxed out or close to being maxed out. 

As far as saving money goes. My plan was to continue saving 500 per month during the snowball period, making weekly payments to the CC I choose to pay, with any remaining money at the end of the week going into said CC to pay it off faster. Once the avalanche period starts I plan on switching and putting 500 a month into the card I'm paying off as opposed to my savings with any remaining money at the end of the week going into my savings as to not neglect that. 

The issue with my savings is that I want to be able to put some of my them/ invest them into something meaningful that would actually benefit me in the long run even up to retirement age while also keeping part of my savings on deck like in a basic savings account in the event that I need to pay for a sudden large expense (like if my car breaks down). My employer does offer a 401K but the only issue is that I think at the moment I would prefer to get as much take home pay as possible to wrestle down my debt, and have more control over how much money goes where as opposed to having the money somewhere I can't necessarily touch it. If there are any alternatives, I would appreciate any advice. I'm not sure if my best bet would be to just keep putting my savings in a basic account with my bank while tackling my debt and finding a way to invest it once I have more breathing room.","Advice for 26yr old that is finally starting to buckle down financially?

A bank I am working with for a mortgage said my credit came back as 710, which is completely out of the blue. The difference in credit scores means a 0.25% higher interest rate on the loan.

Is it possible that my credit scores as provided by the above sources are all wildly inaccurate and my score is actually 60 points lower than it has been for years? 

Alternatively, is it possible the bank is feeding me a wrong number to bump up the interest rate? I highly doubt that, since this is a regional but still large and established bank, but the thought crossed my mind.

1424,personalfinance,"A few years ago I got scammed into a PACE loan for a home improvement project (energy efficient attic insulation thingy). I had just bought my house and was a first-time homeowner and didn't know any better. The guy who sold me on it did some very nice sleight-of-hand where he would point out the low 2.99% interest rate on the PACE loan and the fact that it would be paid off through my yearly property tax bill, while never mentioning that with all the fees and additional costs they charge, the *effective* interest rate was closer to 11%. When I recently went back through the paperwork and saw that I really kicked myself for going ahead with it. 

But apart from the actual loan amount that I owe (about $8500 left to pay) this loan has cost me probably tens of thousands of dollars indirectly. Back when interest rates were at their lowest, I wanted to refinance to save myself some money but had forgotten about this loan. Turns out I got several offers for a full 1.5% reduction in my fixed interest rate on my mortgage (dropping down from 3.99 to 2.49). But everyone told me they couldn't do it as soon as they discovered I had a PACE loan, which turns out counts as a lien on the property. That really whistled my pickle.

Another super annoying thing that happened: last year the dumbasses doing escrow review at my lender fucked up and did not calculate the amount for the loan that was in my property tax bill. So what happened *this* year? Right, a big escrow shortage resulting in a $400 per month increase in my mortgage for the rest of 2023 to make up for it. I know it'll settle down next year probably but that still pisses me off.


So I want to pay off this loan and saw that they take credit card payments (with no additional fee). I did some churning a while back so the question that immediately popped into my head was, ""Why can't I just apply for new card that has a 0% introductory APR for, say, 15 months (those are a dime a dozen) and pay it off with that? Heck, I'm seeing a lot of these cards have $200 to $400 welcome bonuses, no annual fees, and some of the better ones are 2x points on all purchases with no limit. I can just divide the balance by 15 and pay that amount monthly to pay off the loan interest free. I do not anticipate I'll have any issues making the payments.

While this seems like a no-brainer to me, my question is: is there anything that might prevent me from doing this? I'm thinking for example of something like there being limitations on what kind of credit card purchases qualify for a 0% APR on the new card. I've never heard of anything like that but I want to make sure my plan has no holes in it. I don't want to be opening a new card for no reason. Or might there be anything that I'm not considering that would make this a bad deal?",Pay off PACE loan with credit card?,1672869647
1425,personalfinance,"**Questions:**  

1) Do I need to setup an irrevocable living trust for myself or just have a power of attorney?

2) Given that I am already disabled, does it make sense to look at long-term care insurance?

  
**Background:** I (53m) have a complicated set of medical conditions and my physical capabilities are deteriorating quickly. I can no longer drive for more than 10-15 minutes, only get about 3-5 productive hours each day to accomplish everything needing to be done, have lost significant use of my fingers and feet, have limited balance, cannot stand for more than a couple of minutes, cannot lift significant weight, etc. It is likely the next significant flare of symptoms will be fatal or permanently debilitating. This could happen tonight or a year from now, but short of a miracle, I only have a few months left before I will need assistance with daily tasks (bathing, using the toilet, etc.).  


I have two teenagers (17, 15) living with me at home in the US, one with a learner's permit who will hopefully have a driver's license in the next couple of months and the other about to take their driver's test. The older teen does all the cooking after I dropped a bottle of oil next to a lit burner and burned my hand on the over within a 24-hour period.   


I have a cleaning service that does a full clean every other week and a local landscaping company care for the yard.   


My sources of income are disability insurance through my previous employer for 2/3 of previous gross pay and VA disability compensation for 70% under appeal to get me to 100%. The disability insurance company has made me file for social security disability. I am still paying for private medical insurance but the copays, annual out of pocket maximum, and prescription costs are eating up my budget.   


I rent a handicapped accessible home, have hit the break-even point on my auto loan, and have $24,000 in medical bills spread across three credit cards. I have $150,000 in a 401k and $3,000 in emergency savings. I have a term life insurance policy for $850,000.

I will be owed back compensation from the VA if I win my appeal.

Given how quickly my ability to care for myself is going downhill, I have started looking into in-home assistive care.   


I don't have enough assets to normally even think about a trust, but the trust seems like a good idea. The trust can pay for my care while I am alive and then have the kids inherit anything in the trust when I pass. When the VA pays the back pay, I can wipe out the debt and have the trust purchase a handicapped accessible house for me that the kids could sell once I pass.

1438,personalfinance,"Greetings!

I live in the US, and feel I am facing a dilemma. I know this is a question many have asked in some form or another, but basically I am worried my older car could break down/become prohibitively expensive sometime in the next few years. Here are the details:

I own a 2013 Chevy Equinox with just over 150,000 miles on it. I own the car in full, no loans on the vehicle. Besides regular maintenance (oil changes, tires, etc) the only major expense I have incurred so far was the alternator failing last year. So I am currently averaging about $700-800/year in vehicle upkeep, plus $1500-2000/year on gas.

Looking at used cars, I cannot find many Equinoxes with more mileage than mine. That has me worried that I am nearing the end-of-life stage of the vehicle. With that in mind, is it worth it to trade it in soon for a new car? 

I would be trying to get a Bolt EUV. If I can avoid dealer markups it would be a $30k car, $5k down payment, and I would guess $5k trade in based on the used pricing being $8-12k for cars similar to mine. The IRS says the 2023 EUV qualifies for the current EV tax credit of $7500, so by next tax season end I would get back my down payment + sales tax, and I would have a car I know will last at least 5-10 years reliably.

Summary of costs:

Current Equinox - $2800/year, could spike in price

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I am barely surviving. Everything I read says to put more towards retirement but I can't afford to do that. Where I live is incredibly hard to find a job. The only reason my rent is affordable is because I own a house with my fiance and he pays the mortgage while I pay the utilities. But we live in a terrible neighborhood and are desperate to get out before starting a family but that would mean increasing our bills. Our hope has also been once we start a family (3-4 year timeline) that I can leave my job to become a stay at home mother. Which also leads me to question how much I should be putting into retirement if the plan is to eventually leave my job. 

Where do I start? I have the money to invest. I continue to try to look for jobs but will hear nothing from them. I feel like I am failing.","Need help planning out my finances and retirement fund, young and working first real job",1672863378

1486,personalfinance,"Would you sell an investment at a loss to pay off high interest debt (16+%)?

I have an investment (not tax advantaged or a retirement account) that I bought before I had any debt, and I could liquidate it today (at a loss) and pay off the debt instantly. Or, I could keep the investment, and cash-flow the debt for a few years (having optimized for budget and spending already), but my calculations show that the interest expense to do so would be nearly identical to the realized loss I'd see by selling today. 

So while I'd get the ""immediate guaranteed return"" equal to the debt's interest rate, I'd also be realizing a loss, so does that in effect make it a wash? Not really sure how to frame that in my thinking, or if it's even relevant. I suppose I would get to write-off that loss on my taxes for the next couple years. 

Generally, this investment isn't something ""that fits my thesis"" anymore either (as the smart folks would say), that is to say, I wouldn't buy it today given what I know, though I believed in it when I did. It could of course go up, liquidating it could be a lost opportunity, or dumping it now could prevent me from realizing a total loss.  Without a crystal ball, I guess I have to decide that for myself. 

To close, I've avoided saying what the investment was since this is a ""personal finance"" subreddit and not ""cryptocurrency"" but this particular investment is Ethereum and while it may go back up, it could also tank once the SEC decides it's a security, plus I'm kinda disgusted by both the fraudulent scam ""alt coins"" that it's helped spawn as well as the direction it's headed having switched to proof of stake. but that's a conversation for a different sub.

Questions I’d love some insight on…

**Buying a house / What to do with our cash**

We were holding onto the cash in the hopes of buying a house soon, like asap. I even lowered my 401k contribution to get more cash in the last few months. However, any decent house in the area is 1.2m+ and the 110k cash we have saved is just not enough. Even with the housing prices coming down, due to the high interest rates, buying a house doesn’t seem like a possibility any time soon. 

So the question is, should we continue to hold onto our cash but put it into HYSA so we can guarantee usage in a year or two? Or give up on the idea of house and put most of it into the market considering the market is low now? I’m not necessarily trying to time the market, we’d likely end up DCAing it over a few weeks. I’ve reset my 401k contributions to max as of 1/1/2023.

The issues — it's very difficult to know what college will actually cost in 18-25 years, and that alone makes me unsure enough to not depend only on grandparent contributions.

My current company has a free Financial Advisor to help with anything 401k (only with John Hancock), so he looked into this all for me and he's estimating I'm likely paying about 2% yearly on my Fidelity balance, so about $240.  Whereas John Hancock would be just shy of 1% - which varies based on investment options.

Honestly, this all confuses me beyond belief and a financial advisor giving me this info only confused me more. 

The biggest benefit I see to rolling over my Fidelity 401k to John Hancock is that I would have access to this financial advisor to advice on investments, etc. based on my total balance.  However, I hear Fidelity is just a better option than John Hancock, which I why I lean towards leaving it there - but do I rollover to an IRA?  If so, I know nothing about IRAs - I'm assuming I'd need to do a lot of the investment decisions myself then, etc. 

Any input or advice is much appreciated!","401k Advice - Keep with Fidelity, rollover to Fidelity IRA, or rollover to John Hancock with new company?",1672858752

For reference I'm 24M and got married in 2022. This review covers my income and spending this year, along with my thoughts on what I did wrong and can improve on. It is excluding my wife who spends about the same as me but makes 20% more than me. This is a long post, in hindsight I'm not sure how popular it will be, but I enjoyed writing it and I think it helps me to see it written out and motivates me to be better. Hopefully it can help others as well.

Breakdown of the linked pic:

* Total income: $96k
* Total taxes: $11k (doesnt include any returns)
* Net income: $84k
* Total Spending: $62k
* Net Income - Spending: $22k

Note: the monthly income is high in mid summer as I started a new job but stayed with my old job for a couple months. I am thinking of going back part time this coming summer to increase my income again. 

This year was a big year for me, some purchases include:

* $15k for half my wedding/honeymoon
* $5k down payment on a new car
* $3k on office supplies for my wife and I's new WFH job
* $20k or $1700/month for half the mortgage, utilities, car payment and insurance

Note: This may explain my high spending, but I am worried about the other $20k on misc that I haven't tracked (mostly amazon, traveling, and food) is very high and may increase. Hopefully 2023 has less large purchases and can shift an additional $20k into savings/investments. Other than knowing my big purchases and investing 20% automatically I have no actual budget. 

&amp;#x200B;

||Year Starting|Year Ending|Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Savings (Cash)|$13,296|$12,295|$(1,002)|
|Retirement/Brokerage|$6,442|$30,420|$23,978|
|Debt (Student loan/Car)|$(19,689)|$(39,430)|$(19741)|
|Net worth|$49|$3284|$3235|

&amp;#x200B;

Note: This graph above shows a breakdown of my cash, retirement, and debt to gather my net worth. As my first year working full time I'm happy to increase my net worth, but given how much I made a total increase of $3235 or just 4% of my take home pay seems really low. On the flip side my cash/retirement increased almost $23k in one year. Which is more than 20% of my income, so I am happy with that.

Goals for 2023:

* Cut spending by 30% down to $42k (is this still too high for my age/income?)
* Increase Savings/Emergency fund to $20k
* 40% of my income into my retirement accounts
* Increase salary - Get promoted, could be difficult as I'm only 6 months in.
* 3 one week destination vacations

Notes: I feel like I'm setting tough goals for myself, but realistically achievable if I keep with it. I aspire to FIRE and want to be better. I believe if I push myself enough I can get promoted this year, but I only have 6 months of experience and no degree (I'm in finance), so this may be an unachievable goal. The last goal is a reminder that I don't want to be all work and no play. My vacations don't have to be expensive, but I want to set the goal and time to get out of the house and relax. 

Overall I'm new to having money, I always thought I was good at saving. But it turns out I'm really good at spending.

What do you all think? Is my spending insane? Should I set a real detailed budget, if so any recommendations on resources to help? Is dropping by 30% even enough? Let me know if you have any pointers, advice, or comments.","2022 Income and Spending Review, Am I spending too much?",1672857069

I accepted a job back in August that requires me to move to the greater Seattle area. They gave me plenty of time to move, and I'll be moving soon.

I currently enjoy MCOL-LCOL, and even here I have chosen to spend a little more to get a good social/walkable apartment location . ~$1800/mo 1 bed.


As for finances (the important part):

I'm 23, single, dog owner, no student loans, no debt (minus car payment)

My base salary is ~160k, bonus eligible (usually 10-20% per year) + yearly RSUs (~$30k/yr)
I should note that my compensation was decided on the fact that I will be moving to Seattle, so nothing will change. If I chose to stay it would have been less.

I'm currently maxing 401k, HSA, and my company's Stock Purchase Plan.


I use YNAB so my view into my spending/bills is pretty easy.

My monthly take home after taxes/contributions is ~$7k.

I pay $1100/mo for my car (including insurance/gas)
I have no credit card debt, student loan debt, or retail loan debt (i.e. phone financing etc)

I budget $500/mo for my dog (whatever is left over goes to a fund for potential medical expenses)

Utilities/Bills usually total around $400 (absolute max)

Admittedly I'm a bit of a spendy person when it comes to going out/eating out, but that's by choice and is entirely malleable and can be reduced at a whim.
Last month I spent $1000 on eating out/going out


Onto where I'm conflicted. Moving to a HCOL area obviously will cost more. 

I'm thinking I should pay $3k/mo for rent + parking, but I'm not sure if that's excessive (or i could be affording more?)

I'm curious what my options are? I've been reading about mortgage porting, allowing you to essentially keep your current terms and move into a new property, but I just got off the phone with my lender and she doesn't think that's possible with an FHA loan.

I put myself 27k in debt, I spent every paycheck I made on her, nails, expensive trips to the salon and sold everything I own trying to make it work including my vehicle.

1550,personalfinance,"Hi all!

I don't have a *ton* of debt. I've balance transferred debt from a few cards and kept paying it off, and my credit score is around 730 at the moment.

I have $5,000~ between two cards from balance transfer deals that have 0% APR until December this year.

I have $4,500 on a card that has 18%~ APR (AmEx). The thing is, I'm in the middle of moving in with my partner (saving money after the move also), so money is really tight. I have good habits - most of the debt was from medical bills that balance transfers helped me from accruing interest while paying it off (started with close to $18k~).

Is a loan from a place like Upstart worth paying off the 4.5k~ card that has APR on it? I went through the process and my loan for 5K would have 10% APR - which makes sense hypothetically to move forward with. In addition - with us moving in together, we have our security deposit + other moving fees to pay.

Is it dumb for me to apply for a $6K loan at 8-10%, use most of that for my 18% APR balance and pay it off, and the rest for moving costs? And then of course the focus becomes paying off the 0% APR balance transfer debt - but obviously the interest debt comes first.

Any thoughts here? I have a good 401K that I contribute my max too - don't want to take a loan from that.. but I have no clue if that's better...

I'm not understanding the situation very well and I'm asking for insights from people who have gone through this. This is for 2022, and I'm preparing my paperwork to do the taxes. 

In short:
1) In January 2022, I contributed $6,000 to my Roth IRA (on Vanguard).
2) By the end of the year, my annual income is way above the Roth IRA contribution limit. 
3) Called Vanguard and told them to remove the excess from my Roth IRA and transfer the funds to my Roth Traditional account (which I opened just now). I think this was called re-characterization. They moved the extra funds from my Roth IRA to my Roth Traditional account. Because this year was red, and I was in loss, they moved around $5,300 to Roth Traditional. This action has generated a form that I will present to my accountant when doing the taxes. 
4) Once the funds were settled in Roth Traditional acc, I asked Vanguard to do a conversion and transfer them to Roth IRA. They did and they told me that I must fill form 8606.

My questions:
1) When I fill this form, should I declare just $5,300?
2) Where am I submitting this form? (to the IRS website?!)
3) What should I bring to my accountant when doing the taxes?
4) Is this amount nondeductible or not (this is the part that confuses me most and I'm not sure how to proceed, the funds came from my net salary).

1562,personalfinance,"Hi, I hope I’m in the right place. I’m looking for advice/opinions on my current financial situation and curious if buying/building a home is the right decision for me given the current market. 

Context: 

I’m a 26 year old single adult in South-Midwest USA. I currently have the privilege to live in my parents house due to both personal and financial reasons. Since I don’t pay actual rent I have been able to save up a few thousand dollars and I’ve even dabbled a bit with investing the last year (nothing crazy, just some mutual funds and a 401k with my work). I have no immediate plans to move out nor are my parents planning to kick me out,  but obviously I don’t want to live with my parents forever. 


I have recently been offered the opportunity to buy some land off another relative for an extremely discounted price. (They’re asking $500 cash for 3 acres of land, kind of a steal)
Having my own property already would (presumably) make building a small home a more realistic option for me since I could use the land as collateral. I’m just not sure if this is a wise decision financially? 

I’ve been looking around for months on rent/mortgage prices in my area and I’ve been comparing them to the average cost of building a small home/building/trailer.  I’ve found that the price is basically the same either way, and that doesn’t even include the price of land. So I’m thinking if I’m paying the same amount either way + basically getting free land I’m kind of stupid not to take this opportunity, right?

I just worry I’m being too naive and not considering this from all possible angles. One of my biggest regrets in life was listening to all of the adults in my life telling me to go to college despite the huge financial consequences. I don’t want to make this decision as carelessly. I have never owned land or a home, my only experience is renting a few different apartments during my college years. Furthermore I haven’t borrowed this much money before. There are a lot of “what ifs” and I’m not sure if it’s wise to make a commitment like this. 

More context: 

- I’m very in debt. I owe about $80k in student debt. I haven’t started paying my federal loans back yet due to deferment but I have been making pretty aggressive monthly payments for the private loan I borrowed. I anticipate to have the private loan paid off by the end of this year. I also still owe on my car and will for another few years. These things alone I feel like are flat no-no’s to a lender, my debt to income ratio is kinda screwed right now. Even if I can secure a loan, I feel it will be absurdly high interest/monthly payment. 

- The land in question is very close to a popular liquor distillery that gets a lot of tourism. I don’t think I’d have much trouble selling the land/home later down the road should I decide to move, 
but that is a “what-if” that worries me a little. There’s no telling the future. 

I think that about covers it. If anyone has any input or advice it would greatly appreciated! Thanks",Is Buying a Home a good decision for me?,1672852658

I'm debating on what payment option to take for a coding BootCamp. They offer three options:

1. A 6-month program paid upfront at $20,000
2. A 6-month Program is deferred at no interest for $31,000, paid by 15% of your monthly salary once you do get a job.
3. A 12-month part-time program deferred at no interest for $33,000, paid by 15% of your monthly salary once you get a job

For all of them, you are given 12 months to find a job after you finish the program, but I'm assuming it will take me six months to land a job after each program.

Also, the expected salary for a new job, conservatively, is $80,000 for an entry-level. I want to keep this comparison simple, so I do not want to calculate any other possible wages.

In short, the company match won't be vested for the next 2 years. My income is low $100ks and I expect this to grow modestly through my career.

I do not expect to stay at this job for another 2 years for a slew of reasons. In fact, I had just gotten through a tough interview process before getting told ""we want to hire you but they just froze hiring"". They said they'll reach out to me mid-year when they expect the freeze to be over. Even if they don't call me back, I plan on leaving in the next year.

Up until now, I've been contributing 6% to fully leverage their match. Obviously, my own pre-tax contributions to the 401k are nice. The funds are OK and I ultimately will probably just roll over into my IRA that I manage.

Is it in my best interest to just continue contributing the full 6% or should I just take my full paycheck and contribute it to my IRA?

1615,personalfinance,"Hi All - I have two fairly specific, related collections questions I'd be grateful for some guidance on. The TL;DR is I got calls from collections agencies about two different bills, one which I never received the original of, and the second which I tried to pay but never received an answer from the company on how to access their system to make a payment. Trying to figure out how to resolve these without tanking my credit report, which I've tried very hard to keep pristine :)

I got a call from a collections agency saying a FedEx invoice I owed was in collections (value of $51.50). I was pretty surprised because I never received snail mail or email information about this bill/invoice; the first I heard of it was when collections called me. That being said, I made two big moves recently (one domestic within the US, and one international, I'm now based in the Middle East), so there's a chance it was never forwarded (I did set up mail forwarding to be safe). Now, this is a $50 bill, I just want to pay the damn thing. But I'm concerned about this showing up on my credit report. It's not currently on my report, but my understanding is if I pay the bill, it may still show up on later; at that point, do I have any recourse? Would showing them proof that I paid the bill be sufficient to get it removed from my report? Is it worth contacting the collections agency and asking for confirmation that this won't get reported before I pay? I've never dealt with collections, so not sure what a reasonable ask is here.

The second issue is with ConEd, the NYC electric company. I closed my account with them when I left NYC last summer and transferred everything to the new tenant. A few months later I got an email truing up the amount I owed after a meter reading (about $300), which I was ready to pay. Problem was their website wouldn't let me log on to the system to pay b/c my account was closed, so I emailed support asking for guidance on how to pay, but never heard back. I called them, they told me to email support.....So a few weeks ago I get a call from collections about the bill, which on a personal level I find frustrating given that ConEd sent me a bill with no way to pay it, but that is neither here nor there. I asked them to email me the invoice with payment instructions, but haven't heard from them. They even took down my email address, so not sure what the deal is. This one is also not on my credit report, but I'm not quite sure what to do. I stupidly didn't write down the name of the collections agency so don't know how to follow up. I *do* have a copy of my email to ConEd requesting guidance on making the payment, but as of now, that's the only proof I had that I tried to fix this debacle. Any ideas on what a reasonable next step should be? Am I just a sitting duck until they either contact me again, or this shows up on my credit report?

I've never had anything sent to collections before, and I'm not trying to shirk my financial responsibilities here, but I also know that navigating collections agency can be tricky and I just want to do the right thing while protecting myself/my credit history.

We have had a brokerage account with Morgan Stanley for over 15 years. I also keep a rolled over IRA with them. The performance of the investment hasn’t outpaced non fee based investments but I’ve stuck with them because they assist with financial planning and review our entire portfolio. They have also assisted with questions about real estate planning (purchased a second home for my mother to live in). However, the support has dropped in recent years to levels that make me want to try something different.

Most of our investments are with Fidelity now (401ks, early career Roths). I also just move our emergency fund to Fidelity because I can draw better interest rates than B of A these days (although I’m still trying to identify the best fund).

I met with someone at Fidelity to discuss the process and to be quite honest, I wasn’t overly impressed with the guy. Consolidating all of our accounts at Fidelity, we are in the ballpark of 2m so I was disappointed in the first interaction.

[M26, NYC] I’ve had a Chase debit/savings account for a long time, opened when I was back in high school.  For two years, I’ve had a Chase credit card.  I pay off 90% of my card every statement.

But I’m below water in terms of living expenses.  I have stuff in a Roth IRA and a Brokerage Account elsewhere, but I am not touching that except to add to it.

My Chase savings account has $15k, and while I am optimistic about a raise in the near future (and very likely a change in employment too), my current income does not support my basic living arrangements.

I need to basically liquidate my savings, put $5k-$7.5k into a checking account, and put the remaining half into the mentioned brokerage account.  My hope is that the $5k-7.5k can supplement me until the raise/transfer of job.

But Chase seems to mandate that I need to have a savings account in order to have the checking/credit accounts, and my cursory knowledge of modern banking practices leaves me thinking that I don’t need to keep my money there with them, doing nothing for me.

1630,personalfinance,"Hi all,

Me and my wife are planning on moving from NYC to South Florida (Pompano Beach area).


We are both engineers working in pharma. I have been sporadically applying for jobs in the last year to see my chances of employment.  I’ve received 2 job offers in the last 6 months, both for the 80-100k salary range (I make 93k in NYC right now). Obviously I rejected both as I was just feeling out my chances. I have only applied for those 2 jobs.

The reason me and my wife want to move to FL is that we are both passionate about water sports, and want to live somewhere with year-round access to warm water. We have already decided on Florida, and have taken 4 vacations here in the last year too feel out the area as much as possible.

I contribute 20% of my income to my 401k and we have no debt.  Our current combined salary is 170k.  We have around 35k saved right now and expect to have 50k saved up for our “moving” fund by May which is when my lease is up, and I’d like to move. We also have an emergency fund that would cover 6 months of expenses.

I recently decided to get into investing, starting out with some low-risk index funds such as those offered by Vanguard. I realised that a Roth IRA would be a great way to go about it for this year and next (up until I start working full-time and my potential income exceeds the Roth limit).

I was thinking of investing maxing out the combined contribution over this year and next to 13k. I wanted to check if my understanding was clear:

* I can withdraw any earnings tax-free after a 5 year period if I invest in the index fund through a Roth IRA (in the situation that I need to leave the US and use this money at home, for example) and any principal amount tax-free at any point?
* If my full-time income after next April exceeds the limit, I can still contribute this year and next year prior to April? \[Unsure about this point--*I'm confused about what is considered a yearly income by a Roth IRA*\]

My current contribution is 10%, but I can go if suggested. However, I max out my Roth IRA for myself and my wife each year, and I'm about halfway on my 401k max yearly contributions. I'm 30 and make around 110K annual salaries, before bonuses, etc.

I have tried searching for any type of grants, assistance, or additional loans to cover those costs. Honestly though, it all goes over my head and I feel so stupid and discouraged.

My car loan balance is 21k &amp; my note is $443 with 52 payments left ($23,036). Essentially it's costing. me 2k over 4 years for the loan. That makes it 500$ a year.

1703,personalfinance,"Hi team, seeking some forecasting strategies or advice for a year full of varying expenses MoM and past expenses that don't seem necessarily indicative of future spending habits. 

**Life situation:** 

* Been living with my fiance at her moms (rent free) for the past 6 months 
* Getting married end of March and will be spending about $25k on our wedding over the next 3 months
* Both with predictable salaries and get paid twice a month
* Would like to move into our own apartment soon (ideally before our wedding - budget permitting)
* Started tracking expenses in Mint since October, however, it has been hard to trust using those expense categories in a forecast for 2023 because we've been traveling / eating out more, spending much less on groceries and haven't been paying rent
* We have travel aspirations this year (Honeymoon &amp; plenty of weddings) that we want to budget well for to help us decide if we need to make some sacrifices this year, and or to help alleviate my financial stress
* I will also add that last year was a bit of a tough year for me where my salary was below my cost of living (Damn you Bay Area...) and I only recently was able to crawl back from CC debt thanks to the living situation with the future mother-in-law &lt;3

All this to say, I have been somewhat paralyzed trying to put together a 2023 plan for ourselves. My current thought process is: 

1. **Nail down a reliable estimate per general category / month** (Groceries/dining, Bills, Car, shopping, Health care, personal) - really difficult to nail down when I don't feel I can really trust the last 3 months of Mint charges (very high travel expenses, for example)  - *any advice on how to do this effectively?* 
2. **Adjust those expenses by month** (increase rent, grocery, utility costs when we plan to move out)
3. **Add in large ad hoc planned expenses** throughout the year to account for our potential plans (Honeymoon flight purchase in Feb, Paying wedding photographer in march, etc.)
4. **Nail down savings** \- Understand which months can we actually expect some savings. Unfortunately, given all of the increased expenses with wedding &amp; moving out it feels like we'll have to deprioritize monthly savings in the short term to be able to fund some of these big purchases (I'd like to not do this obviously, as we'd love to start saving up to buy a house)

So I'm seeing if anyone has any forecasting strategies or advice they might be able to help me out with to nail down our financial plans for this year full of expense changes. 

**Ultimately my goal is to understand:** can we afford ALL of those weddings we got invited to? Can we  afford a 2 bedroom Apartment in LA? Is it feasible for us to get a dog? And to generally get control, understand, ownership of our financial situation, to stop stressing about money and big purchase decisions. 

FYI I am trialing out YNAB, but realize that the tool is less for forecasting and more for getting some ownership over our finances (especially since we'll be combining most of our finances)

&amp;#x200B;

I was a victim of identity fraud last year as someone tried to file taxes using my SSN. My identity fraud case was finally complete last month and I received letter from IRS stating as such.

&amp;#x200B;

In their letter they said that they will be sending me an IP Pin via snail mail every single year but that this year they won't be able to mail me a pin since it is so close to tax season again.

Later on in the letter they said that it is also possible to obtain an IP pin on the IRS website if I choose to do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a difference in getting an IP Pin via snail mail  every year as the IRS said they would provide, or can I just make an account and generate my own pin? If I generate my own pin online does that mean the IRS won't send me a pin in the future years via snail mail?",IRS IP Pin for taxes,1672810008

Am I right to assume that while financing may not be as advantageous as earlier this year, if we pay cash, the land immediately cashflows, and the income will pass thru to LLC to me, where I will pay straight marginal rates. (40%+)
If we finance, the net income will be significantly lower.  Obviously, we're paying financing costs, but given 40% taxes, this is still significantly better.

**to note. I know of the avalanche/snowball method of dealing with debt etc, but I am concerned she doesn't make enough money to make any progress in paying any of these cards off**

Originally she was $9,000 in debt. So we devised a plan and started paying it off monthly and it would have been done by this month. When I asked her the progress she withdrew and showed me the truth.

The debt was not $9,000, but actually grew to $14,000 and was spread to over 6 credit cards. And he credit score was 550 according to equifax. **in short she didn't tell me the truth**

She can easily pay off 2-3 of the cards as they are only $300 each. But the last 3 start at $1,000 and go upwards from there.

To add to this she has very little income. I'm talking 800-1000 a month. And that's if I pay for all her living stuff so her whole check goes straight towards her debt. 

The problem being of course I have no idea if she is making so little that she is basically throwing her money in a bottomless pit and she's going to keep owing more and more?

So any advice will help. Does she pursue bankruptcy? She is 30. I just dont see how she can get out of this if she doesnt make enough money unless someone gave her the money which her parents nor i am willing to do. And letting this go for this long not doing anything about it.

It really makes sense for her to keep this reliable vehicle that's already partially paid off rather than give it up for a junker she doesn't have to finance that will nickel and dime her to death.

She's asked me how I feel about co-signing the auto loan.

FWIW, I'm in my mid-40s, 750+ credit score, 6 figure income, no debt other than my mortgage, which has $170k remaining, because I haven't had this house that long. It'll probably also be a long time before I need to purchase another vehicle, myself.

I don't have a ton in savings, though, outside of my 401k for retirement, because I paid off a lot of medical debt over the past 3 yrs, so as much as I'd like to help her avoid the loan, I can't just gift/lend her a large lump sum of money, because that would wipe out the remainder of my savings. With debt gone, I'm shifting focus this year to building my personal savings back up.

Step-mom has no problems making the payments, just can't get the loan. She's on a fixed income from my dad's pension/social security, and works part-time. I know she'll go to working full time if she needs to, but her earning potential is low.

One is as an adjunct professor at a small fine arts college and the other is in customer service at a grocery store. Neither job pays super well, but since I’ve been living at home with my mom and haven’t been paying rent I’ve managed to put a few thousand in a 401K as well as a few more in a checking/savings account. I currently live in a medium sized city in the Midwest, so things are relatively affordable. 

So as the title says, I’m just starting to get to the point where I’m making about enough to afford renting an apt and living on my own in the city. This is tempting as most of my friends who are my age are currently living downtown and doing the whole “city life” thing i.e. dating, being near bars/restaurants, having a bunch of people their age near by and since I’ve been living with my mom for the last couple of years I feel like I’m missing out a bit. 

But on the flip side of that, I’m looking at apartment rentals in my city and notice that I’d be paying the same monthly amount in some places as a mortgage. All I would have to do to buy a house is save up for a down payment. 

I don’t know. I guess I just want peoples insight/opinions. Is it crazy to stay with my mom till I’m potentially in my mid-late 30’s if I can eventually buy a house, or should I just bite the bullet and start renting now, knowing that’ll it be way more difficult to save for a down payment in the future?

I currently have $123,000 in my OPERS account that can be refunded. I’m also going back to the federal government where I’ll receive a pension (currently have 4 ½ years and plan on staying indefinitely.)

I currently have:

$25,000 in TSP
$13,000 in Deferred Comp
$6,300 in IRA
$11,000 in HSA
$11,000 in mutual funds

Debt:

$200,000 – Mortgage at 3.625%
$34,000 – Personal loan (Home improvement) – 6.34%
$12,000 – Car loan – 3.74%
$27,000 – Car loan – 2.5%
Cash/Emergency Fund - $15,000

If I rolled the entire amount over to an IRA, at 65 with a 7% annual ROI, it looks like it would be around $817,000. If my math is correct, I’d have to live 40 years after retirement to receive that much via my pension.

Two questions:

Should I leave my pension with OPERS or roll it over to an IRA? Although I’m generally an optimist, I don’t trust OPERS to remain solvent long-term, nor do I trust our fat cats in Columbus to keep their hands out of the cookie jar forever. I’d also like to roll it over while the market is down. 

Should I cash out enough to pay off the $34,000 personal loan since the interest rate is high? I believe, in additional to the taxes, there’s a 10% penalty for cashing out any of my pension early. I’m hesitant to do this, but the thought is appealing.

In April I got a double whammy -- I found out my job was being terminated in 30 days due to a merger, and I got diagnosed with Acute Leukemia. I had to stop everything and check-in for an undetermined amount of time to start immediate chemo treatments. My old boss found out that I was diagnosed on my last day at work, and felt terrible. They suggested (since I had to start treatment that same night) I jump on COBRA to extend my coverage, and my boss offered to pay for the next 6 months of COBRA while I was getting treatment. It was a really nice gesture. 

Since I had lost my job (and consequently, the job I was interviewing for to move over to) and was stuck in the hospital, I also qualified for Medicaid as a secondary insurance. Since I'd met my deductible on my primary, and had Medicaid as my secondary, I was assured by the oncology / hospital ""you shouldn't have to pay out of pocket for any more procedures."" 

Now, at the end of 2022, I've had several chemo treatments and a bone marrow transplant. I get a bill for $900 worth of services. I call the hospital. ""Your insurance denied it."" Both of them? ""Both of them."" Hmmm. I call the insurance company. ""Oh we didn't deny it, they coded the bill wrong. It's not a surgery, it's a cancer treatment. Different code, different billing departments."" Okay. Call hospital. Tell them they billed it wrong. ""Okay!"" A month goes by, I hear nothing.

I'm 26 and engaged. She's a couple of years older. Our financials: 


* I make ~100-110k a year salary, she makes $85k.  
* We save about $4k/month, primarily because we live in an utterly trash apartment.    
* Jointly, we have ~$200k saved for a house downpayment. We live in a HCOL area. This money is sitting in some mix of I bonds, short-term treasuries (4-5%), and HYSAs.  
* I currently am set to receive a substantial pension upon retirement, so I haven't been putting a ton in to 401k: I've saved ~40k, she's saved 0.    
* She has about 20k in student loans.   


Here's where things get complicated. 

* We had planned to get a house during the coming year, but we don't really like the city we live in and want to move back home  -- across the country.

* Franky, I don't know if I'll still feel that way in a couple of years. Hence uncertain goals. 


* I could probably make a lot more in a different job, but my employer has paid for a (very expensive) grad degree and I need to continue working for them probably through the middle of next year. 


* I also don't want to buy a house during the current market.


* We also want to have kids during the next couple of years because of her age. Kids are fucking expensive in the city we're in now.

1799,personalfinance,"My partner and I have racked up a large amount of debt on a credit card with a staggeringly high APR. I'm an authorized user on this card and I hadn't realized that the rate was so high until last month when I wanted to know for sure because we felt like we were getting nowhere with the payments.

Debt is ~9k and the interest rate is ~28%

Knowing that, I wanted to try and get our balance transferred to another card with a low rate (or none for a starting period) so we could have some room to breathe. To this end, we signed up for the Citi Simplicity card hoping it could help us. Got the card, limit is $2000, and we've called support to get it raised and were declined due to the newness of the account. We're not even going to touch this one if we can't use it the way we planned to.

The original card is paused and we haven't spent with it in months now. I've committed to paying it down $500 a month. Partner has agreed to that as well, but they can be inconsistent because of the nature of their job. So I see two timelines, one where we pay $1000/mo and one where we pay $500/mo.

With $1000/mo, if my numbers are correct, we'll have this thing paid off in about 10 months and incur ~$1000 in fees. If we trend closer to $500 each month, we'll pay it off in 2 years and incur ~$2300 in fees.

With our new card, the balance transfer method only seems to work if we can get a credit limit that can cover the bulk of the debt. Doing it $2000 at a time will incur 5% transfer fees, and the original debt is still accruing interest while we pay the other card off.

So now I'm not sure what to do...

1821,personalfinance,"Hi all,

I am a newer ""higher income"" earner and have always historically invested in both a traditional IRA and Roth IRA.  I was contributing to my Roth IRA for 2022 until August when I realized I was over the allowed AGI to contribute to a Roth.  

I had a pre-existing Traditional IRA (from a previous employer 401k rollvover) and contributed to it instead of the Roth IRA thinking it was a smart idea since my 401k was maxed and it was an option for additional investments as of August until current.  This was before I knew about backdoor Roths. 

So, for 2023, I'd like to do a backdoor Roth.  The issue is that I have this pre-existing Traditional IRA that has quite a bit of money in it.  My thought was to do a reverse rollover into my current employer 401k, but I made the mistake of contributing money into it that are no longer pre-tax as of August of this year (see above).

  
My questions are:

* Can I just withdraw the Roth IRA contributions as cash without penalty since I shouldn't have made them?
* Can I still do the reverse rollover from the traditional IRA to my employer 401k even though there are 4 months worth of contributions that are not 'pre-tax' so that I can begin doing clean backdoor roths as of 2023?  If I can't do the reverse rollover due to the post-tax IRA contributions that I've made in 2022, what are my options?

I am 25 y/o and looking to solidify my retirement plan. A little over 3 years ago I started contributing just enough to my 401(k) to take advantage of the full employer match (post-tax). As of 1/1/23 my employer started offering Roth 401(k) contributions. So today I decided to reallocate my investments, update my contributions to Roth, and convert my existing 401(k) balance to a Roth 401(k) account.

Now that I have my 401(k) set up the way I want, what do you guys suggest I do for additional savings? I have been going back and forth on whether I should open a Roth IRA and max that out or just increase my 401(k) contributions and put the extra money there.

The only thing I am skeptical about with the Roth IRA is that I read the income threshold to contribute is around $150k, and I anticipate I will surpass that sometime within the next 5 years.

I purchased a 2022 Ford Bronco this year and chose to take a partial loan ($30k) to boost my credit score. It worked, but I stupidly put the saved cash instead into my 401k/IRA/brokerage and it's plummeted, and I now want to sell the car.

I can currently sell it for \~$8k above what I paid for it. However, the bank I have the loan through will not issue the title to a new buyer.

$2.8k in Vanguard brokerage account

$30k in eTrade brokerage (stocks that were gifted to me from my grandmother over a decade ago, XOM and Msft, I would prefer not to touch these for sentimental reasons and the fact the market is so down... This might be stupid rationale and I will politely accept a roast)

- Take-home pay per month: $4k
- Total expenses per month (includes $200 allowance for fun money): $2k
- Emergency fund: $9,300 in a HYSA as of December 2022
- Federal student loans: $14,500 (2-4% APR, but no interest has accrued)
- Private student loans: $10,470 (5.79% fixed APR on a 5-year payment plan, where I have been paying $202.05/month since September 2022)
- No CC debt

I’m not worried (yet) about my federal student loans, but I am wondering if I should continue investing in this bear market or pay off my private student loans in full. Over 5 years, it will accumulate ~$1,650 in interest—$330/year.

My job doesn’t start matching a 403b until I have put in one year of service in July 2023, at which point they will match my 5% with 8% on their end (13% total). My take-home pay should roughly be the same after 5% pre-tax starts getting taken out on account that my taxes get lower as well. 

I plan to retire early at 45 yo in my native country (Philippines), where the cost of living is much lower; and so I don’t ever plan on maxing out my 403b—or 401k if and when I do switch to a private sector. I haven’t crunched the numbers, but I feel that maxing out my Roth IRA every year going forward is more than enough to cover my expenses from 60 yo onwards.

Now the question I have been pondering is the following:

1. Go all in into an SP500 fund through Charles Schwabb and continue investing my monthly savings and hope for the long term gains.
2. Buy a rental property (probably an apartment downtown in the capital), paying no less than 50% of the asking price and financing 50% or less. Pay the loan + all extra savings into the principal to try and pay off the property. The idea being into creating a cashflow stream in the medium term. Probably once I have 3-4 apartments start diversifying my savings into SP500+rental.

All help is appreciated as I am a bit lost on what to start focusing at this stage.

In my thinking, I cannot have the 401k pull on there as it would be past the max allowed for the 2022 year (which is when this pay period is from) and I shouldn't need to contribute additional SocSec taxes as for 2022 they were already completed and my last few stubs has a $0 value for those.

I am a project manager for an engineering company. I have had my position for around 5 years.
I do good work, consistently get good reviews and have normally received decent yearly raises.  

This past year was tough. Some things happened early this year with the company owner who had a lot to do with the day to day inner workings of the business, and he had to take a huge step back. This was followed almost immediately with the other project manager quitting.  I was handed about 50% of the workload, (on top of my usual work) but somehow managed to make it through. It was a hard year. My boss did give me a small bonus (first bonus ever, despite bonus/profit sharing being a talking point and dangling carrot for years! We never thought they would actually follow thru on it)
I honestly just felt like it was the least they could do considering how much more work and stress I was absorbing with the internal company changes. 

All in all, it wasn't a great year. Things still are not back to normal, and it seems the expectation moving forward is that my work load will not go back to how it was in 2021/early 22. 

I was curious what contract would look like this year.  I received it this week, and was disappointed to see that I was receiving a 2% raise. By far the lowest I've ever received.  My review was great, they were happy with me and my work. 
Considering cost of living has increased in my area by 7.5 %, and I know the company has priced new work accordingly, I wasn't thrilled and spoke to my manager, who said that they've decided to start doing a yearly bonus at the end of the year, (up to 8% of my current wage) if certain profit margins are met. So basically, I AM receiving a raise according to them, it's just in the form of a bonus. 


I really don't know how to feel. To me, a bonus is meant to be a bonus, and considering how long they've been talking about it and dangling the carrot, it feels a bit sneaky to finally initiate the bonus, but do it in lieu of a raise.

1854,personalfinance,"Hi all,
I understand property taxes increase every year and I expect it, I was just a bit surprised this year and have some questions. 

My husband and I bought a house in Massachusetts in June of 2021. The estimated taxes were 3,306.

In January of 2022 we saw our taxes were increased to 3,532. That was about a 220 dollar increase. We knew it would increase because it was the first year after buying a house. All is good and fine. It ended up being a 30 dollar increase per month with insurance also increasing. Not the end of the world 

This year though, we just received our taxes and they will be 4,004. That's an increase of about 470 dollars, which is about a 13% increase. I'm looking at a 70-100 increase in my monthly payment if my insurance increases the same way. 

Is this normal? Allowed? Do I expect it to continue every year because I don't know if I can continue to afford the monthly pay increase of $100. I thought the cap increase in mass was 2.5%",Property taxes continue to increase exponentially?,1672788371

1856,personalfinance,"With the new year here and being able to contribute to my wife and I IRAs for the year 2023, I realize that we might actually be over the contribution limits for 2022 and 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in March/April 2022, my wife and I opened IRAs on Vanguard and deposited $12,000 in each, $6,000 for 2021 and $6,000 for 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

For the year 2021, our AGI was \~$132k, and both my wife and I earned over $6k that year. All good.

For the year 2022 however, I believe our AGI will be \~$210k, so pretty close to the contribution limit for 2022 ($204k - $214k). I am not sure how to confirm that AGI before filing for 2022.

For the year 2023, I would expect our AGI to be \~$220k, once again very close to the contribution limit for 2023 ($218k - $228k). So at this point I believe we won't contribute to our Roth IRAs for 2023 and open traditional IRAs instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this situation I have a couple of questions:

 \- I'm still not sure how to calculate MAGI from AGI. Our tax situation is pretty simple (filing jointly, no mortgage, no student loan, standard W2 employment for both), so can I assume that AGI = MAGI?

 \- Should we deduct the amount of IRA contributions from AGI (so $12k for 2022 for example)? I see you can also deduct tuition and fees, what does that cover? Childcare expenses?

 \- If we contributed more than we should have for 2022, how do I correct our contribution? Should I just reach out to Vanguard directly?

 \- What would the penalty be? 6% of the over-contributed amount per year? So if we contributed $1000 over the limit and I do the correction before March/April 2023, I can expect a $60 penalty?

I moved back to CO on a huge whim and it actually turned out about as well as it could have. I am now making 76k with a raise to 78k this spring working a union job in Pueblo CO.

Houses are expensive here but it seems like after 2023 things may get more reasonable (330k for a new house for example). Company is about as good as you can get in my field, there's 1 other place 1-1.5 hours away where I could make a few dollars more but realistically this is it. I'm not sure I can fathom working this job for 30-40 more years but it is very cushy and legitimately may be the best job in the whole industry with everything accounted for, or at least among the top ones. I could make more but it'd be doing 3rd shift in a more expensive area which I have no desire to do.

We have some downtime at work so I started programming again and finished a big side project. Prior to that I did an internship at the end of my 2nd year in CS as a software engineer intern. It got me thinking about finishing my degree. Long story short the local and online options just don't seem good to me. So it seems like if I want to finish the degree I'd need to go back to SC for 2 years, which the university has approved with in-state residency as a readmit.

Recreational Spending (video games and computer parts mainly): \~$150 ($20-$120 most months, but when I upgrade my PC every couple of years it is like $4k-$6k. 

Total Spending: \~$4220

&amp;#x200B;

Savings: 55k ($21k of it is a 6 months emergency fund).

&amp;#x200B;

For the car, I am ideally looking to spend I would say no more than $15k. My current car has had no real issues until recently and it cost around $13k when I bough it 9 years ago.  Just curious if $15k is too much or two little for that much of an ask. I also dont put a lot of miles on vehicles I have since I work from home full time and do not commute. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also plan to buy in cash, and not with a loan, but when it comes to income I am also moving to a different field that makes more into the six-figures, but I dont count on that until it happens which will hopefully be within the next 6 months.

1908,personalfinance,"Bank rhymes with 'Villainy"". Fitting, LOL, since they're focused on high-interest lending.

TL;DR: Can I call Villainy Bank, ask them to reinstate the accounts and continue making payments? Is that a thing? 

Or do I just settle for 25-50% of the balances due, and accept I'm not doing business with VB for 7 years, if ever again? Will my credit report show that I settled, and for what percentage?


Trying to make long story short, life has sucked and I basically stopped paying bills for 6+ months. I moved, Villainy Bank's letters returned as undeliverable and I guess they assumed I flaked on them. One regular credit card ~$4K line and one ""promotional financing"" ~$1K line auto repair card. Both, of course, maxed out.

If Villainy Bank had said ""pay up by x date or it's going to collections"", I would've done it. They called about a billion times but never laid out a timeline by which account would be charged off. My other credit lines did, and those I paid up.  

The good news: the VB credit card never showed up on my report, for some reason. The auto repair card did, but neither are showing up now. 

I'm not some lowlife deadbeat. I spent the money, and I then spent more money instead of paying back the money I spent. So I want to pay back the bank if I can. But if I can't, they abandoned me by charging off my account, so screw them &amp; I'll settle it with the agency. 


I would estimate I paid back between 40-75% of the total spent on the accounts before they were charged off, excluding fees and crap.

Fast forward to today, and I get a million credit alerts at once, all telling me that my old account is with a new collections company. I am just now finding out that no matter the start date of the original debt, if it gets sent to a new company, the age essentially resets.

Shame on me for not knowing that, but I'm trying to do what I can to fix this ASAP, since my score plummeted overnight. Obviously, if a debt could in theory float around from company to company, and just keep resetting forever, my best option is to just pay it off, right? I could theoretically pay it all right now, but it would almost wipe my E-fund out (I guess that's what it's there for, right?) 

I also know companies are often open to some kind reduced settlement negotiation...is there some kind of guide on how to make that work?

We both work full time for the same employer, in non-patient care Healthcare field and have WFM flexibility. My wife has always seen working as a means to an end but is terrified of financial instability, due to circumstances growing up. However, with the cost of daycare we are looking at ways of making a transition for her to SAHM. She would prefer to raise them over working a less fulfilling job, if possible for the next 4-5 years. Daycare costs would go from 7k to 20k if we chose that route (would have to move daycares and go from part time to full time for first child).

Current combined income is $101k ($52k &amp; $48k) before taxes, and it is likely I will receive a promotion in the department in the next year as everyone in our department has received this promotion after reaching my experience level ($52k to $67k). If not, there is a competing employer hiring for my exact position that this is their salary floor. I plan on applying regardless but prefer to continue where I am.

Additionally, my BIL and his wife are expecting in April and have expressed interest in paying my wife to watch our niece. My wife would love to do this as well, charging a “fair” rate (slightly under market value, around $8-9k), but we also want to consider tax implications of this for them and us (report income vs. cash, deductions,  etc).

We are close and on very good terms but also want to consider contract/liability issues as I am sure that 99% of problems could easily be worked out but would want to be protected.

My situation is fairly straight forward but I've been getting conflicting advice on how to budget. 

I'll be making $80,000 pre tax, more with bonus but I don't want to count on that at all. It should be taxed at 22%, plus social security and stuff will bring it to about 30%? 

So, I'm left with about 55k give or take, or $4600/mo. From here, how do I break this down? I have no car payments or anything like that, my only overhead should be rent and food and gas.

1955,personalfinance,"Hi! Apologize now for the wall of text! I’m 27F and need some help making sure I am making the correct financial choices and determining how to better plan for my future! I feel I have decent financial skills, I have a budget and mostly follow it, I’m working on building up my credit score and I’m focusing on saving but I am concerned I could be making better informed decisions. Currently I make $85/hr which after time off thought the year ends up being around $170,00/yr USD and I don’t see much potential change in my income in the next 2-5 years. Here is a breakdown of where I currently stand:

For pretax contributions my health insurance is quite expensive, $170 a week. I also plan to fully max out my 401K this year. My 401K is the only account I have for retirement and with the market down its currently sitting at ~$27,300. I am concerned that I am not saving enough for retirement but not completely sure how far off target I am. My employer does match but its very bad, the match ends up being ~$1,000-$2,000/year.

I have $76,000 in Federal Student loans ($17,500 in my name &amp; $58,500 in parent plus that I am paying) Currently have $59,500 Saved, mostly from July 2022 Forwards, did not put in HYS as payments were expected to return EOY. Still saving an additional $300 a month, to cover remaining balance and planning to move this into a HYS account until federal payments start again.

I have $17,400 saved for a house, real estate is very bad in my area, I’m targeting to build/buy in 2024 so planning to save $1,000/mo until I buy. That would put ~30K as a down payment for first time home if I purchase in early 2024. I am planning to also move this to a HYS account.

I have $8,800 in an Emergency fund and continuing to save $200/mo. 

I spend about $1000/mo on my car. $200/mo for insurance which I could drop down to about $175/mo. And I have a ~$46,500, 65 month loan at 1.24% leaving me a monthly payment of $845. I also have $8,750 saved for car expenses, mostly tires &amp; registration (very expensive in my state) but could cover any other emergency repairs, I’m not currently adding any additional money to this savings.

I also save ~$400/mo for “fun” stuff, money to spend on concerts/travel/fun experiences etc. Currently this account has $5,600 in it.

Currently I live at my parents home and pay $0 for rent &amp; expenses. I am hoping to move out to an apartment sometime early 2023, I have $5,500 saved up for furniture, and all the one time costs at the start of the lease. I live in a HCOL area so a 1 bedroom will be ~$2,000 - $3,000 a month before utilities. I would prefer a 1br over a studio because I work from home full time and would like the extra space.

I also plan to spend around $225/week on groceries, household supplies and generic spending money once I move out.

I have 3 credit cards, one through my main credit union, one department store card (they were a previous employer and employee discount was easier with the CC), and an Amex gold. I do ~98% of my purchases on one of these 3 cards to get the points/perks and fully pay them off each month.

I have a few main questions and am looking for general advice on things I can do to improve my financial decisions.- Am I saving enough for retirement by just making out my 401K? What other options do I have as I believe my higher income would make me ineligible for some accounts?
- Regarding the $8,750 I have saved for my car, would it be better to keep this saved for car expenses/registration? Or should I put it towards the car loan or allocate that somewhere else?
- Will 30K be enough for a down payment on a home as a first time home buyer? I know this will depend heavily on the market/area but I’m not sure if 30K is reasonable in general or if I should target more.
- Realistically how much can/should I afford for an apartment when I move out? Is 2-3K a month feasible? I for sure want to stay below $3,000/mo for rent &amp; utilities as I know I could better spend that money earning equity, but is that even a realistic target for my income/expense level?
- Any other advice or ideas on things I should be doing differently to better prepare myself for my future?","27 and unsure if I am making the right financial decisions and budgeting correctly, looking for some help!",1672775721

1963,personalfinance,"TL;DR: Looking to buy a home in the Denver area and hopefully take advantage of the housing crash people are predicting this year. My primary objective is to build equity.

My finances are as follows: I'm 27M and work as a software developer making $86k annually. Monthly I take home $4600, of which $1200 goes to rent. After factoring in necessary expenditures (gas, groceries) but before impulse spending, I have $2300 per month (probably spending less than $300/mo recklessly so by a conservative estimate I'm still $2k in the green.) I have $57,000 in liquid assets. My credit score is 760. I have no outstanding loans or debts.

My lease is up in April, but I'm aware that 3-4 months is not enough time to find a house. Ideally I would renew for \~6 months and have something lined up by the time that expires late into the year.

As of right now, Zillow is showing very few listings below $400,000, and the Buy or Rent calculator says that at $400k, I would have to stay there for at least 8 years to break even.

My first question... Is this objective is realistic and worthwhile at this point in time? I figure this crash will be the cheapest property is going to be (especially in Denver) for a pretty long time, which is why I feel pressured to act soon. On the other hand, if I were career-focused enough, I'm sure I could get my career path to outpace inflation.

Some other general questions:

* I'm aware that market fluctuation is unpredictable, but it seems people are still able to make educated guesses about it. Is there a rough estimate on what would be an ideal time to buy?
* Aside from HOA fees, what other considerations are there regarding a condominium?
* Aside from hiring a home inspector, what should I be paying attention to when assessing the quality of a home? I'm capable of using my own eyes and ears, but tips on where to look would be helpful.
* I have no experience negotiating with a bank over things like interest rates. What should I keep an eye out for? If I get a lousy rate can I just walk away and ask a different bank? If I don't have a house lined up, can I just walk in and ask for an estimate for what kind of interest rates I would qualify for based on my income and credit?
* I plan on keeping a decent amount of money in my bank account even after my down payment, as I intend to be prepared for maintenance-related incidents that require immediate attention.

Now, I work part-time starbucks while full time back at school, and doordash as additional income. I've always had a buttload of debt, which is no different now, however now that my income has been cut short, I will no longer be making sufficient money to cover all my debts. For minimum monthly payments for car, rent, and loan/credit cards (so, this does not include the cost of food, gas, phone, etc) then I pay $2,800 each month. That means for work at my average pay 15/hour, I'll have to work around 200 hours each month to meet bills, and that's on top of school. Considering I'll likely only get 80-100 at sbux, that means I'll have to do 100 hours of doordash each month. That's my current outlook, and it's really grim. 

I have had little help from people in my life in decades past (I'm 34 now), and due to medical issues and other life circumstances it's been incredibly difficult to get on top of finances. I paid off almost all of my student loans previously, but have been paycheck to paycheck for a while. 

in credit cards/loans, i have about 63k in debt.  i also got a new car (my first one ever!) and i owe 36.6 total still, only had it for a year. Rent is maybe the only thing that might be flexible, although i have already worked out a deal with my gf for somewhat lower rates so that's not really an area i can do much more saving. 

for expenses, I've pretty much limited all expenditures. even for food, I take as much of the expiring food from work as they will let me, to keep costs down. I'm really at a loss. I may have tax return money, and I may have student loan money coming back to me for next semester's classes, but at best these can maybe push me out a month or two. I'm already spent through any of my savings, and right now I'm about in tears every night because I feel so utterly hopeless with my situation.

I know nothing about bankruptcy or anything like that, I'm scared they'd take my car as it's the only asset I have, and I love it, and it's quite reliable. I'd still need a vehicle to get to/from work and school, and not having a car would put a serious dent in my ability to make income to pay debt. I'm working on re-doing my budget, AGAIN, but it just seems there's no amount of hard work and bootstraps that can get me out of this mess. 50 hours a week on top of class seems like so much, and that's provided I get scheduled at sbux and there's doordash availability. 

What should I do? Should I look into bankruptcy options? If i do that, what is the liklihood they'll let me keep the car I have, or will they repossess it? that's my biggest concern. Should I j ust do what i can to work as many hours as i can and prolong all of this? I'll ask my parents for cash, but I expect them to say no / have no funds available.

1988,personalfinance,"So I have a question and I will admit it is a fortunate position to be in. And I tend to think I am splitting hairs here. But is maxing out a 401k/thrift always a good idea?

Here is my situation: Hubs and I are the same age (late 30s) and make decent money, although we are in a high COL city so we aren’t wealthy but we are well off. We both max out our retirement and have been since we started our careers around 27 (school before). Because of our higher salaries and with match, we have each been putting 17% away in tax deferred retirement accounts. We own a home and our mortgage is 2.85% so it is cheaper than rent in our city. Have about $15k in stocks, $20k cash, and $20k ibonds that mature this year. So while our retirement is rather healthy (even with the downturn and starting in our late 20s) I would like to have more accessible funds. 

One of the reasons we didn’t save more outside of retirement is because we both had hefty student loans (mine paid off last year hubs done in 18 months). 

The question is this: should I cap our retirement savings at 15% so I can invest/save more in non-retirement accounts? Or should I just keep matching because at this point I’m just splitting hairs and that extra 2% will mean so much more when I retire in 25 years? Like increasing from the $20,500 to $22,500 for 2023 is going to cost less than $100 from my paycheck which I probably won’t notice with my COLA adjustment kicking in.

If I am not able to max out my Roth IRA every year is it still worth it to open one and put in as much as I can even if it is not $6500 Are there any downsides to this I should be aware of? Can I just leave my money in the Roth IRA untouched or would it be best to make investments? I just don’t want to feel like I am losing any money I am very frugal and don’t know enough aside from what I’ve read. It’s why I’ve never done any of this sooner. 

I have emergency funds in cash as well over 5k, zero loans, car paid off, money in my checking and of course I plan to keep more money in my savings. The only big future purchase I plan to make is to get a place of my own. Once I land a good paying job which will take awhile. Right now I live with my parents to save on my cost of living.

1992,personalfinance,"Hi all, 

I am 24 years old and am not very fluent when it comes to retirement savings or investing and would like to try to maximize my retirement/savings yield. Below is my current situation:  


* 24 years old, making $75,000 in US
* Live in a city, but don't plan to live here for more than a few years, so I don't think buying a house makes sense at the moment, but I would like to own property sometime sooner than later
* No car, only expenses are rent, groceries, and other basic day-to-day things
* Each month I put away around $1000-$1500 into my high yield savings account which is currently at 3.3% APY
* I currently have around $75,000 in my savings account which netted me almost $200 in interest last month
* I have a little under $30,000 in gov student loans, no interest has accrued and the payments are frozen, and I am waiting to pay this until we find out whether the $10,000 relief comes through/when the payments unfreeze
* I switched to a new job last month, so I have two Fidelity 401k pretax accounts
   * The one from my old job has about $20,000 in it (similar salary to the new job, and this was after 2 years)  and is no longer getting any money put into it
   * The new account is set to 8% contribution with a max of $2,000 match from my employer
* My takehome pay is about $2,000 semi-monthly (from around $3,000 gross after taxes, insurance, 401k, etc.)
* My rent is only $800 as a friend bought a house and split the mortgage between himself, me, and our other friend/roommate. However, my rent will probably go up to around $1000-$1300 next year if I move in with my girlfriend as I may be doing

My main concerns are, should I be putting the liquid cash I put in my savings account into some other form of investment like a Vanguard account or something similar? If so, what is the best way to maximize the free money? Should I be putting more into my 401k? 

In general, what are the best ways to invest/plan with my money?

Also, when it comes time to pay the student loans, does it make sense to pay it in full, as I did the math and the current interest rate nets me more in my savings than the interest I accrue on the loans. However, this would only make sense if I leave the money in the savings account instead of investing or moving into another account, and the APY remains high.

2005,personalfinance,"I am hoping to get some good advice and not sure things could get any worse than they are already. I’ll try to be concise while also adding pertinent detail. 

A couple of years ago I (stupidly) co-signed for an apartment for my brother and then a couple of months ago I got notified that I got a negative mark on my credit report. It turned out to be for the apartment for a little over $10K. 

I had started receiving harassing calls from a collection agency a couple of months prior to the negative mark but I never answered. They rarely left voicemails and when they did, they were looking for my brother specifically. I didn’t really piece it together that it was for that apartment. Eventually I blocked the number. A couple of weeks after, I received calls from a different number and they left a voicemail and this was the first time my name was being mentioned.

I ended up answering and they explained what the debt was for. Up to this point, I was under the impression that I was relieved from any co-signing responsibilities. This was due to the fact that I had spoken to the apartment manager 2 months prior to the end of the original 15 month lease contract to ensure that once the contract ended, I did not approve or consent to any extensions or renewals. I was told that my brother had already submitted the notice to move out by the end of that contract.

Fast forward to the day after I received the derogatory mark notification, which is when I left work early to speak to the apartment manager. Of course, the apartment was under new management so this wasn’t the lady I had spoken on the phone to the prior year. Thankfully she was really nice and tried to help me understand as much as possible. She told me that my brothers contract “rolled over” into a month to month plan which meant that I was still responsible as a co-signer. On top of that, she could not provide me a copy of the lease contract for some reason but she had it pulled up on her computer and showed it to me. She pointed out that my name nor signature/initials were nowhere to be found on the contract. 

By this point, I go home to review all my documentation. I found a pre-leasing agreement that I filled out and signed but the form specifically says that it’s not a guarantor binding document and was strictly to see if I qualify for co-signing plus it showed it was for unit X but the actual lease agreement I was shown was for unit Y.

I’ve sent a cease and desist letter to the collection agency along with a copy of the lease agreement and pre-leasing form claiming that this was under dispute. So far the only “proof” they have provided is a copy of that pre-lease form as well as an itemized statement from the apartment (which does not show my name on). I’ve also filed a dispute with Experian which was finalized just this past Friday and the results show “verified and updated”.

So I just now got off the phone with Experian and they claim that they have confirmed that I am responsible but that they cannot provide me with the proof directly. They direct me back to the collection agency for that but as I mentioned their “proof” does not seem valid.

Do you guys feel the uber benefits, saks fifth avenue, dining credit, walmart+, and equinox are all pointless? Like I feel as though I am spending more money on these things mainly because:

1. Uber Credit: I have a car. I do not need uber. I rarely use it. Plus, for uber eats, what does $10 a month from GOLD or $15 a month from Platinum really get you? You still have to pay delivery fees, service charge fees and tip. All these add up still making you pay more than just driving to a place and picking it up.
2. Saks Fifth Avenue:  I don't regularly shop at Saks Fifth Avenue. I think $50 every 6 months doesn't get you much so maybe for me this credit is pointless?
3. Dining Credit: Same issues as Uber Credit. Gotta pay that delivery and service and tip. Also, going to a restuarant for this credit just seems save you money on the tip or dessert. Not even that great. It just seems like a small benefit that incentivizes a person to go there on purpose to save a meager $10, which is just tip or dessert or appetizier money.
4. Walmart+: Just go to walmart and pick up what you need. End of story. Don't be that lazy
5. Equinox: Yeah, give us some credit for a gym that costs $200 a month. Give me a break. This is a joke. I would rather they give us free monthly membership for LA Fitness or a local gym that everyone uses.
6. Another thing: AMEX Gold gives you 3x points on flights, and AMEX Platinum gives you 5x points on flights. I would rather use the Gold card and save on AF. 

Maybe I am not the target customer. But lately, I switched from the AMEX Trifecta back to my student credit card: Discover IT. I have noticed I spend way less. My spending habits are way better because I am not purposely trying to squeeze every benefit out from these AMEX cards. Maybe the real question is why are these AMEX points so valuable and people will spend more than usual just for points?

I'm happy enough with my investments as they are, but I've been doing a bit of forward looking planning in terms of how I could access this money eventually.

So basically, for New Year’s Eve my friends and I got a hotel room. Everything was cool and fun. I put the room on my card because it was my idea. After I checked out I got emailed a bill for 169 dollars. That’s fine that’s the price I was told when I booked. Then when I check my account at home it says my card has a pending charge for 190 dollars.

I called up there to see if there was some explanation for the extra money, and the worker seemed confused and was looking at my reservation from over 6 months ago for prom, where I got snacks and stuff from the lounge and charged the room, however, when I got the bill when I checked out, they never charged me for the snacks. Then he realized his mistake and went to the correct reservation from the night before and said that 169 dollars was the correct price and that it was “probably” just an incidental fee that will go away

So it’s either an incidental fee or they might be trying to charge me for the snacks from 6 months ago I’m not sure since the worker seemed unsure too.

Basically my question is can they charge me for the snacks from last time? If they didn’t put it on the bill last time, and I didn’t get any snacks this time therefore it wasn’t on this bill either, can they charge me for them since it’s not technically on any bill?

Right now the charge is pending, but in the case it doesn’t change to 169 dollars am I allowed to dispute the charge? Or would that be wrong?

Hello, this my first time in this community post and I am sort of in a pickle. To start off, my mom wants to use my credit score to purchase a property in NJ to rent out to people as an investment property. However, I refused because I am saving up for a home for myself down the road.

My mom is remarried and my stepdad does not have credit because he does not have papers. They were talking about purchasing a home among themselves to rent out to others, and my mom asked me to co sign with her for the home. I refused because I want to use my credit down the road to get a loan for myself. Afterwards, my mom got upset with me and said ""I don't help her with anything"". I was confused because whenever she needed something I was always there and I never ask her for anything. Then I asked her ""you had 10 years to figure out your credit so why are you trying to hurt mines""?

Today, they both tried to convince me but I still refused. They said that once my stepdad got his papers he would use both my mom and his credit score to refinance the house under both of there names, and I would lose nothing. TBH, that sounded to good to be true and that made me even more skeptical of there plan. They also stated that I would get something out of it but this seems like something that we will fight over and I am not interested in investing in property right now.

I'm being made redundant (being laid off) from my job. This will happen on Monday of next week. I have significant share options vested with the company.

This means I will end up paying a little over 200k total after the income tax hits. I don't have anywhere near that money, but if I don't exercise my options then I will lose them in 12 months.

I set both of the risk profiles to relatively high, with the understanding that I'm young and I have plenty of time to build my retirement nest egg, and that any potential growth would outweigh short term losses, however with the market as it is right now I'm starting to rethink this strategy.

I also have a Roth IRA with Fidelity that I contribute a little here and there into FZROX, FZILX, and FXNAX. 

I’m also confused on how to add more to my Roth to utilize the tax advantages. My paycheck gets deducted for my 401k, but how do I get automatic transfer from my paycheck to my Roth so I can save on taxes and utilize my Roth more instead of my 401k? 

Any advice on all this, if I’m doing things right, how to change things and if my allocations makes sense.

I know an elderly married couple for my entire life. They are now in their 70. and are thinking about their future and their health. Both are not the healthiest anymore, some hip problems, spine problems and health issues. The husband is in better shape than his wife and is still doing all the chores. I recently visited them and he said that he thinks that he soon won’t be able to do the chores anymore and that she won’t be able to cook anymore.. I would help them if I would live in the same country because I would feel I owe it to them as a friend, but I can’t as I’m far away.
Then he said he would gift his apartment to a person that takes care of them when it’s time, but he does not know anyone who he can trust and is afraid that this person would maybe poison them to just get rid of them to get the apartment. 

I went home pretty sad because of their situation, and then I thought I could hire a person, give them a monthly salary and he could give me the apartment because he trusts me. So the whole dilemma about being poisoned is not there anymore, the hired person would not be interested to get rid of someone when they get monthly paid.. but my husband said that we would need a contract to take care of them for life and that we can’t know what medical care they will maybe need in 10 or 15 years and it could be a financial disaster at the end.

Thankfully, this high figure is based on wrong assumptions^(1), and I re-did her taxes properly and it's down to $2,800 and $200 interest.

The instructions on the notice said if we agree, to send a check. If we disagree, to respond in writing. I have the response, along with all new forms and schedules.  

My question is -- now that the [interest is 7%](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/interest-rates-increase-for-the-first-quarter-of-2023) (4% Federal Short Term + 3% fixed), is it wise to send a check for what we believe to be the correct amount + interest? The idea is to stop the interest from accruing even if the IRS wants to counter with other corrections (if any). Or do we just sit and wait... under my assumption interest keeps accruing.

For context, I'm familiar with taxes (IRS VITA volunteer) and am reasonably confident in my new figures for her return. If there is any disagreement with the IRS, it would be small, or they might ask for proof. But it took them 1½ years to send out this notice, I don't want interest on $2,800 (the amount really owed) to be running for another year and a half!

And backup question: should I submit proof, like her 1099-B showing the basis figures? And her medical expenses showing HSA distributions were qualified? I know this isn't an audit, but it shouldn't hurt right?

My fiancee's income is below the Roth limit, so she has been making direct Roth contributions for years.  But where we differ is that she also has money in a traditional IRA.  When we get married, our combined income will be above the Roth limit if we file jointly.

1) Can I still make backdoor contributions and avoid her traditional IRA triggering the pro-rata rule for me/us?  From some quick googling it looks like I can, but I would really like to see the IRS guidance or some kind of proof that I will be safe doing this, if anyone can provide it. I have never filed jointly before and really don't want to trigger any kind of penalty.

2) Because our joint income will be above the threshold, my understanding is that she will not be able to make direct Roth contributions anymore if we file jointly. My instinct is that if her traditional IRA amount is relatively small (like a few thousand), it probably makes sense to roll it over and pay the taxes considering the years of backdoor contributions that might be ahead.  Is there anything else I need to think about here? What other factors are there that I should be aware of?  Does the timing of when we roll it over matter?

My Wife has an HSA from her previous employer in 2021 that we would like to move to a brokerage HSA that's not yet open (Vanguard/Fidelity/etc).

We do not want to roll the 2021 HSA into her 2022 HSA, and instead transfer it to a brokerage HSA (consider it a central HSA for all future job changes versus rolling into new job's HSA). I don't expect her HSA eligibility to come back around until 2024 or 2025 as we need the best HC coverage until then.

Can we even open the brokerage HSA now, on Jan 3rd 2023, based on the fact that she is no longer under HDHP plan that ended on 12/31/22 and now under PPO plan?

As you might have guessed, I’ve recently become a freelancer. Many of you might think that switching to freelance right now might be stupid. But I couldn’t stay in my office any longer. My boss was an asshole.

I’m an interior and landscape designer. I used to work for a small company with a couple of idiots. I used to take some side orders to make some extra cash since my boss didn’t want to give me a raise. He believed that I was not talented enough.

But, after a couple of months of freelancing, I made more money than at that stupid job I had before. I was so into my job and was inspired to create something new that I completely forgot about filing taxes (in a couple of months).

&amp;#x200B;

I faced this pay stub issue when I began looking for a new place to rent. I wanted to live by myself for a while since I needed a peaceful and quiet environment to work in. At my current place, it’s almost impossible. When I started looking for properties, landlords kept asking me to provide a pay stub. Then, I realized that the only good thing about having a job is receiving all the papers required from your employer.

There you fill in all the required info and get a ready-made paystub. You get everything except for a signature from your boss. So, should I sign everything myself if I’m my own boss?

For the past 4 or so years I've had a 2014 Ford Fusion, I took the vehicle from 60k miles to 140k. Now with it being close to being paid off (about 2k away) I'm wondering if I should start looking into trading it in for another vehicle with lower miles. 
I want 2 things out of a newer vehicle: carplay and lower miles
I found a 2008 Honda CR-V with 62k miles for 11k at a dealership. These vehicles are known to last for 200k miles easily so I could pay it off and not have to worry about another vehicle for 4-6 years. 

11k asking price minus 8-6k for my trade in. 

Would it be a good idea to pay off my loan, trade in my current vehicle and buy the CR-V? (I'm going to install an aftermarket radio with carplay) or should I wait on this and drive my Ford into the ground?",Trade in high mileage vehicle that's almost paid off for low mileage vehicle?,1672744985

TL;DR: Do I need to do anything when I noticed I made a purchase that puts me over my credit card's spending limit?

\------------

Yesterday, I finally decided to upgrade my very old phone and ended up ordering an iPhone 14 Pro directly from the apple website. While it's perfectly in budget, and the payment seemed to go through without issue.

Issue: Just realize the card used for the payment has a limit of 1250 euros (yeah it's not a US credit card), and this purchase alone is a little over that!?

How is it possible that the order was accepted but I'm already over my CC spending limit? Do need to do something like (1) call my bank, (2) pre-emptively cancel the order and then change payment method (2) nothing..... wait to see what the consequences are? :)",Going over Credit Card Limit?,1672742672

Long story short, a seller I'm familiar with and I've bought from before changed the price of an item I buy frequently and made the price about twice what it used to be. I contacted them about it and they agreed to reduce the price for me, they said if I made an unpaid order they'd edit the price then I could order. 

I went on r/aliexpress and searched on Google and I did every single thing I was ""supposed"" to do to make an unpaid order but the order for some reason still went through. 

I put in my card number correctly, but the CCV and expiration date completely wrong, which according to literally everything I've read, should put your order in the ""unpaid"" category (and my card shouldn't be charged until I manually edit it back to the correct info.) 

But now the order has gone through, it's in the ""paid"" tab not the ""unpaid"" tab, my card was charged, even though my card info was all wrong and I can't afford to pay for the order at that price. 

I'm freaking out right now because I'm low on money to begin with and I can't at all afford to pay the price of the items when they're twice what they used to be. But now the order went through even though it shouldn't.

I've contacted the seller and they all they can do now is refund me once I receive the order. But shipping is very slow from this site and I don't want to wait over a month to ever see that money again. 

I canceled the order, but now I'm worried I'll never see that money again. It's extremely sketchy that it went through in the first place and since some of the info was wrong I'm afraid they'll say the refund was ""unable to be completed"" or something.

2167,personalfinance,"Hello everyone,
I sold my first house back in September of 2021 and was able to reap 3x profits without paying any taxes on capital gains. This has raised my liquid asset close to $500K. 
I've been living in Europe close to 10 years and took interest in purchasing a property from a dear friend in Germany. Proactively, I converted $200k into euros when the dollar and euro where 1:1. Unfortunately, things didn't work out as plan and I will no longer be purchasing any property in Europe.
Wanting to put the rest of my money to work, I created my first investment porfolio with $170K. I intend to hold it for the long run to profit from its dividends payouts.
Lastly, I dumped $30K on 'I Bonds' (three family members, $10K each account) when the government was offering 9.62% for six months. I plan to hold these for a maximum of five years.
The remaining balance (Approx. $80K) is sitting in my savings account.

Here's my plan for your evaluation:
The €200K I have will be re-converted to dollars upon my return to the States. That could be as early as this year or in the next six years. As the euro slowly recuperates, this will generate a good return. Of course uncle Sam will want his share. My plan is to transfer the principal amount  I converted and the remaining balance, transfer it in increments under $10k to avoid triggering the IRS.

The investment account was created based on performing dividend aristocrat and king stocks. Is this a good option to produce passive income?

How effectively am I managing my money? Is there a better way to produce better results?
My goal is to build a wealth of $1M dollars within the next 10 years.

I am still in college, my parents are going through a very messy divorce and they have multiple properties (mortgages on some) as well as some liquid capital and some other investments (but primarily the properties). Because they could not reach a reasonable settlement, and neither want the other to have it, they want to give anything with joint ownership over to me.

Now I don’t want to take their money, they’re clearly both very unhappy and I want to do the best for them, and make sure they both have a comfortable lifestyle in retirement. Preserving what they have built and not losing too much to this hyperinflation is my goal. I am still a student, and after looking up some basics, it seems like I would have to pretty much immediately liquidate the properties just to pay the taxes, I don’t want to do that. Is there a way to avoid this? My best hope is for some kind of passive income stream. I don’t want to sell them either because it seems like the rent is paying for the mortgage and then some.

I’m really lost as to what to do, I’d like to think I’m good with money but this is a sum of capital entirely out of my pay grade and I'm kinda fried in the brain, both with this news and the divorce.

I had a small amount of debt during that time but managed to pull myself out of it and now able to save actual money for the first time since I turned 18 thanks to some family help (My mom is letting me live rent free for now). I'm at 3k in the bank but I have no investments into any stocks or anything else besides my 401k that was offered by the company I'm in now which I contribute 5% of each paycheck. I'm making $20 an hour currently, with a $0.25 increase every 3 months. My car is paid off and I don't pay for anything currently besides car insurance ($1800 a year), phone bill ($1200 a year), gas ($125-150 a month depending on prices), and helping out with groceries ($200-500 a month). I go out with a friend every other week ($20-40 each time I go out). I don't own a pet or have kids.

I'm trying hard right now to save as much as I can and being smart with my money. My goal is to do a big downpayment on a house (50%) so I don't have to pay as much for mortgage (Houses here are about 200-300k range for a 2-3bedroom 2 bathroom house), but I wasn't sure if I should just do a minimum of 20% downpayment and invest my money elsewhere when I get to that point. My mom is okay with me staying with her for as long as I want to, but I do just want to be on my own, just when I am at that point I want to make sure I'll be ok in case of a layoff cause there is a potential of being laid off where I'm currently at, but there are other places for me to work (just not as good pay about $14-$17 an hour is what I can expect from places like retail/Amazon). So I was thinking of living with her for at least 3 years while I saved hard, 5 years max. Ideally I want to save $125-150k before I move out and then get a place costing in the range of $200k - $250k, $300k max. How realistic/unrealistic am I being?

Background: I'm a student officer for a personal finance club at university, and we're trying to do more speaker events for our members. Someone suggested that we invite a personal finance influencer to come speak. Some suggestions include Graham Stephan, Erika Kullbergh, and Vivian your rich BFF.

I'm somewhat conflicted here. On one hand, I know getting someone who's tiktok famous or YouTube famous to come speak to us will definitely spark and attract interest. On the other hand, I'm skeptical about influencers, especially finance ones, as a whole because of issues surrounding transparency, conflict of interest, and diffusion of responsibility in giving out broad and general financial advice to people who might not fully understand the asterisks before implementing it. I also know Graham Stephan got in hot water for supporting FTX before it blew up on him.

So what do you all think? Is inviting an influencer as a guest speaker to our club a good idea? What should I consider before doing this kind of thing?

2200,personalfinance,"My company recently started offering the option to contribute to after-tax non-Roth as well as in-plan Roth 401k rollovers aka Mega-Backdoor. Super happy about this but also realizing I don't have a way to properly calculate how much to contribute. Here's why:

- 2023 Standard employee 401k contribution limit - $22,500
- 2023 Total 401k contribution limit - $66,000
- Employer matches 4% of Total Compensation
- Total Compensation consists of Base+Bonus pay
- Total compensation is unknown until Jan of following year
- Employer match is paid in Jan of following year

Since I don't know what my total compensation will be in 2023 I don't believe I can calculate how much I can contribute exactly. I run the risk of either under or over contributing.

As an example consider:
Base Pay: $100,000
Bonus Pay: $0 - $100,000
Total Compensation: $100,000 - $200,000
Company Match: $4,000 - $8,000

How much should I contribute in 2023? 
66,000 - 22,500 - x = y
x = employer match (unknown in 2023)
y = my after-tax contribution

If I contribute too much, my employer will not be legally allowed to contribute the full match amount and I lose out on money, right? 

PS. My employer has until March 2024 to submit their employer match for taxes occuring in 2023. Since they are paying out the 2023 contribution in 2024 does that technically mean that specific match will count towards the max limit in 2024 instead of 2023? If so, that solves the equation, but since they're submitting it for tax year 2023, it makes me think this is not the case. 

Thanks for reading this book and for any knowledge bombs you're able to drop. Truth be told, I may not be able to contribute the max but it got me thinking and I want to be prepared. Much appreciated.",How to calculate Mega-Backdoor contributions?,1672717039

2203,personalfinance,"So my SO brought up the idea of moving into a better apartment even though we want to eventually buy a house in the future. his argument is that he wants to live somewhere comfortable, with your own assigned parking, bigger place, better environment and possibly one with a pool/gym.

I don't agree because right now we have the cheapest rent in the city, our rent is $1k with one bedroom and you don't find rents that cheap in the city unless you move to the country side but the country side is about 1-2hrs away from our jobs. you can find rents slightly cheaper but it is always a studio or just one with no parking. We live in New England so having parking is essential! especially during the winter months.

I told him that i much rather stay here until we have enough money for a house. We don't have too complaints where we live except that living in the city has been eating up our cars because of how bad the roads are, is a smaller place, we managed to get an extra parking spot only because our neighbor only has one car but if he were to get a second car then there's a chance we might have to give up one of our spots.

His argument about saving for a house is that because of how expensive houses are here, it would take us years before we are able to have enough for a house. so he figures why not spend that money at a better apartment. We thought of maybe moving to the south since houses are much cheaper but at the same time we don't want to.

2206,personalfinance,"Early in 2022, my wife asked for a deferral that would give her the max $20,500 contribution to her 401k. This was working fine initially but we unfortunately just noticed that in July they stopped making the deferral. (Our mistake for noticing so late…). Apparently their payroll system incorrectly flagged that she had reached the maximum after $10,260. They’ve admitted to the mistake and say it’ll be fixed going forward but that doesn’t make us whole for their mistake.

The missed deferral brings our MAGI up to where we have to reduce our Roth IRA contributions, so this has implications beyond just the missed pre tax contributions this year.

I’m not very happy to accept “oops our bad but nothing to do.” But I’m unclear what we can ask for them to do. Can they make corrections on the last few paychecks with near 100% deferral (and we send them the money)? It seems like if they can’t fix it they might owe us QNEC money but I’m not clear on that and honestly I’d rather a fixed deduction due to the tax implications. We’ve made it difficult on ourselves given we didn’t discover until the end of the year and so no more 2022 paychecks to fix it with.

2227,personalfinance,"TL;DR: Parents are paying $700+/month for car insurance, thanks to two brand new drivers and a recent accident. Is this the rate we should expect?

I'm a 21-year-old driver living with my parents (late 40s) and my brother (18). My parents own a 2020 Expedition, 2014 Edge, 2006 F-150 (paid off), and a 2001 Ranger (paid off). My parents currently pay over $700 a month for car insurance through USAA. I believe it's the full amount of coverage offered. My brother and I only became licensed three months ago, and two months ago I totaled a previous car we had in a collision that was my fault.

Obviously, all of this would naturally add up to a pretty high rate. It's a lot of vehicles, with two brand new drivers and a recent collision on record. With that in mind, is $700+ a ""reasonable"" monthly premium, or is it still absurdly high given the circumstances? I want to suggest to my parents that they at least get a smaller level of coverage, but the full coverage really saved our asses in replacing the car I crashed. Supposedly my mother has shopped around a bit and was not able to get any lower quotes, but I don't know how in-depth her search was. She says she can't find better rates, and doesn't think anyone would be willing to insure us anyway so soon after an accident.

The situation worries me a lot. With the insurance and two car loans combined, our cars are eating so much of my parents' income that I'm afraid it might be untenable. What can we do to mitigate the costs? Do we need to shop around more, reduce our coverage, or just ride it out until my brother and I have longer driving records and/or move out of the house?

Side note: Personally, I think the biggest culprit is probably the 2020 Expedition, but it's been an extremely hard sell getting my parents to consider swapping it for a cheaper car.

2236,personalfinance,"So, i (24f) got myself out of debt last year after going through periods of impulsive spending. I was so proud of myself for paying it off, saw my credit score increase and moved into my own apartment. 

I’ve now stupidly got myself back into it, my bank offered me an overdraft and I took out 2 credit cards which are both near enough maxed. I’m now over my assigned overdraft after bills have come out  and have a few months to pay these credit cards off before my interest free period ends.  

I can’t ask family or my partner for advice because I’m so ashamed and embarrassed to have gotten myself back into this situation. I also can’t face the lectures and feel like my partner would be so angry (and so they should, i would be if roles were reversed) 

I don’t know what to do - I’ve got £5k plus to pay and my salary will just about pay my overdraft and as soon as bills come out I’ll be back in it.

2237,personalfinance,"Throwaway account for privacy. I spent all morning downloading all my credit card 2022 transactions and categorizing to finally look at my financial picture.

I live in NYC/SF. 35 yrs old. Married. No kids (but I want to). My wife makes minimum wage doing art/creative work. This is my current picture:

Accounts:

* $100k emergency fund in HYSA (probably too much, would like to move to stocks but valuations scare me a little bit)
* $100k in taxable investments (all equities)
* $50k in crypto (it used to be more...)
* $120k in retirement accounts (80/20 equities/bonds)

Inflows and outflows:

* $200k annual gross base salary with 15% bonus that I've hit for two years
* $5.6k monthly expenses excl. rent (based on all my credit card activity)
* $4k monthly rent for 1bd apt

My wife covers our pet expenses and a few dinners here and there but we operate under the assumption that her money is just for her given she makes way less than me.

I maxed my pre-tax 401k (20.5k) and my mega backdoor roth 401k last year and I noticed my cash month to month from payroll was just enough or even less than my rent + discretionary expenses after all the deductions (incl. health insurance for 2) so had to take money from the HYSA to pay bills. 

So my question is basically if it's smart to continue doing the same? Doesn't feel like I'm ever going to be able to buy a house in my current city or even move to a larger place, let's not even talk about having a kid. 

Am I saving too much in retirement accounts?

2239,personalfinance,"I am a tradesman in my early 20s looking for the right budget app. I mention I am a tradesman because my hours can be inconsistent, especially in the winter. The app that would best suit me deals in percentages. Here is what I am thinking...

I want to set spending allowance based on percentage of hours I input. For example, lets say I add up all my necessities (rent, bills, loan payment, ect.) and it is $1000 (For easy math). Based on my average spending of less specific expenditures like groceries, water, electric, ect. that most likely can't be determined to the exact dollar amount I can create an ""allowance"" for everything else besides those necessities. Then I want 10% to go to savings, 15% into retirement, 10% in to investments ... ect. So if I work 8 hours a day, when I log those hours I want the money to be dispersed by the amount of time I have to be able to afford that expense. So if I buy groceries once a week (I get paid weekly) then immediately, my grocery allowance will be ""filled"" based on my average spending to eat for the next week.Things like rent, that are monthly, can then be split between, lets call it 4 weeks of pay, equally after my immediate things are paid for.

The math would look like this... 

8 hours of work a day - insurance and taxes = Income

Income - ($1000 / 4) = Share given to necessities divided by time

Income x .10 = Share to savings

Income x .15 = Share to investments

Income x .20 = Share to intangibles

(This is just an example so i don't care to allocate the full 100% after necessities)

Now the main goal i want out of this is to divide up the part of each share NOT USED. If I work more than normal, lets say 50 hours, so I have excess then, because I am using percentages, I will have more than I need or want to spend in any given category which I can then move elsewhere or put into savings.

Vice Versa I want to know on weeks I work less than 40 hours how much I have to pull out of reserve or aware from investments ect. It would be better even if the app intentionally drew out of investments to fulfill necessities when necessary. 

It would be great if I can link my accounts as well.

* **Private** \- $5,700 - 11.24% \[$140/mo\]
* **Private** \- $10,500 - 10.63% \[$280/mo\]
* Federal - $4,500 - 5.05% 
* Federal - $2,100 - 5.05%
* Federal - $500 - 5% \[$60/mo\]
* Federal - $5,500 - 4.53%
* Federal - $2,000 - 4.53%
* Federal - $4,400 - 4.45%
* Federal - $2,200 - 4.45%
* Federal - $3,500 - 4.45%
* Federal - $5,500 - 2.75%
* Federal - $2,000 - 2.75%

**Total: \~ $48k**

**Monthly (Net): $4150 - $420 - $60 - ($120 + $120 + $150) = $3,280 -&gt; $3,250**

I give a rough breakdown above, but the only monthly expenses include the gym, gas, and food which sit under $400 total each month. The only major purchases I've made since getting this new job have totaled $2,000 for a new set of tires and some much-needed preventative/maintenance work on the vehicle.

My plan is to pay off the highest interest-rate loan ($5,700 @ 11.24) and one of my federal ($500 @ 5) in the coming week, setting me back $6,200. It would open up $200 from minimum payments which could be stacked elsewhere, along with these bulk payments I've been planning. Is this a fair method or am I looking at this wrong? Is there a certain interest rate (say 5+ percent) that screams pay it off now outside of my two private loans? I've done plenty of research on snowball v. avalanche but I feel like I'd rather have a mix between the two once I move from my private to federal loans in roughly five to six months. The varying values of principle across 2.75-4.53% are my main question mark because I am aware that at a certain point you'd rather save/invest alongside the market rather than aggressively pay off lower-interest loans.

2283,personalfinance,"Hi /PersonalFinance, I'm a long time lurker but made a throwaway for privacy concerns.

I am looking for advice for my situation and would appreciate any guidance outside my immediate support group who are adamant that this is a great idea. I am mid twenties, single, and employed at current role for 2+ years with 2 promotions in last 1.5 years. Moved to CA during the pandemic, after living overseas 7+ years, and now living with family to save. Not sure if I want to stay here for 'forever' (for marriage, raising kids, etc....this is just a place I live that happens to be the option suited most to my interests currently).

&amp;#x200B;

I am in the stages of signing my purchase agreement for a 2b2b condo in a new development, ETA close date is late spring 2023. I am not sure I should continue with the purchase because it will be incredibly tight for monthly finances, and I am absolutely terrified of having no savings just to have a equity in a long term asset, that I cannot turn to if a recession hits, if I lose my job, or have an emergency. Renting out the second bedroom is fine, but it is on the smaller side (10\*8 ft ish ETA). Some furnishing to move but likely not a huge expense as friends/family would help. I will be getting an additional job to save more (currently work 50ish hours weekly salaried).

&amp;#x200B;

Should I go through with purchasing, or should I rent for a time?

Does this seem like a reasonable amount to live on in Southern California? I worry that in an attempt to purchase young to grow equity with a great mortgage rate, that I put myself at risk by liquidating my cash assets so I'll have no safety net, and will exclude myself from other things in my life (friends' weddings, travel, safety net.) to get this. My family is recommending that I opt out of contributing to 401k after the purchase to have additional $ but that looks like I'd have increased taxable wages and would throw out any ER match.

I've been sober for almost 5 years and over this time I've been trying to repair the damage caused by my addiction.

2289,personalfinance,"Long time lurker here and I have some questions I will try to be brief with...but there's a lot of info so I'm sorry...

&amp;#x200B;

Little backstory, I finished grad school about 6 months ago and moved to another place where I took a job in my medical field. This job pays me very well and is honestly the first job in my life that I ever made good money. I'm 41 years old, single, have a mountain of student loan debt and have a bit of car loan debt...I currently make about 160k per year with my job as my starting salary.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought the car I have a payment on right after graduating. When I moved here to Portland OR, my car was stolen the first night I was here, and I honestly needed some transportation living in a new city, and found what I thought to be a good deal on a car. I didn't' have a bunch of cash on hand since I had just graduated, so I put down 5k on a 25k used car, and my payments are now $462/mo as I also bought a warranty which I normally would not have done. My interest rate is 7 or 7.9%, I can't remember which, main reason it's high is because the car I bought is a 2011 model year and banks don't like to give good rates for older cars I guess...

&amp;#x200B;

I have no life which is good for me financially, but of course terrible for my mental health. I rent an apartment for about $1700/mo, my power bill is about $30-$70/mo, internet is $80/mo, and I spend about $1700/mo or so on food, fuel, car insurance, and other incidentals of living.

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to save a decent chunk of money after my insurance claim paid me out for my stolen car, plus just banking my pay that I don't spend to live each month. I currently have about 38k in my checking account, and about 2.5k in my savings account. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would have even more, but I've been spending a TON of money on my mother who had a bad stroke at the end of September. Spent some money to fly out and see her when it happened, and then I've spent even more money to take care of her and take care of things for her since she makes very little money from disability retirement as well as death benefit annuity. I'd say I've spent about 5k on her in the past three months, and 4k of that was just in December because I need to now pay for her long term care since she still can't be alone and take care of herself...I will continue to pay at least 3k/mo for her assisted living facility.

&amp;#x200B;

First question, should I pay off my car with the money I have sitting? I've been apprehensive given my new financial situation with my mom, plus I know it's good to have money on hand for an emergency fund etc. If I did pay off my car in one lump sum, I would most likely sell it once I get the title just to be rid of that debt. It has kind of become clear to me that perhaps I don't deserve any nice or fun things right now, and I drove back to Portland after seeing my mom with my free and clear car that I had gifted her after I graduated because I wanted her to have a nicer car because I love my mom of course.

&amp;#x200B;

Second question, if I don't pay off the car right now, what should I do with my money?

&amp;#x200B;

Third question, which is more detailed than the last, should I consult with a financial planner or an accountant to go over my situation and get advice on how to invest to make my money grow for later in life, especially given my late start to the game?

&amp;#x200B;

Further backstory, before I decided to go to school, I worked in law enforcement for six years for the state of AZ and have all my contributions along with the state's contributions to my pension, still with the state of AZ. I decided to leave those funds alone after I left in 2012 because there is still a good death benefit for my mom if something happens to me, the money still makes some interest (although I don't know how much), and when I reach retirement age, it will still pay me several hundred dollars per month if I leave it alone...

My boyfriend of 3 years recently purchased a house, originally thinking he  would rent it out but has realized he needs to live in it for at least 1 year for it to be considered his primary residence. He’s moving there in March, and has asked me if I would like to live with him.

If I said yes, we would live there for at least 1 year while I save up money to buy my own house. Then, once I bought my own house we would repeat the same setup and live in mine for at least a year. That way we would each have an asset in our own names before eventually getting married and buying a home together. 

We have talked before about moving in together later this year, so this is an earlier timeline than expected. We are also both very young, 23 and 22. We’re quite serious and marriage has been discussed, but we want to wait until we’re at least 25. 

My main hesitation is that the $1500/mo rent he is requesting is more than I wanted to spend on housing. (I live with my parents currently so I pay $0, but I planned to move out in June to a 2-bedroom with a friend and pay $1300 or less.) However, it’s 28% of my take-home pay so still within general guidelines for rent. On the flip side, I’m paying extra for a lot more square footage and I get to live with the person I love. 

The other main advantage is I don’t love the location. It’s a little over an hour away from my family and friends and I’m afraid of feeling isolated. But I could do it for a year or two.

I live in HCOL area and I currently live in a condo worth about $400k ($75k equity, $325k mortgage @ 3.5% interest). This condo is only about 500 sq ft and I bought it a few years ago. At that time, 500 sq ft was plenty of space but a lot of has changed since then and I feel like I have outgrown the space. For example, I have since gotten a dog and had to build a home office in my bedroom after my work transitioned to WFH (something that I had not anticipated when buying pre-covid)

In order to move up in house, something in the neighborhood of $800k-$1.25M would fit my needs well without having to move excessively far out of the city. Anything cheaper than $800k just isn’t feasible in my area. Problems with under $800k would be things like small size, very expensive HOA fees, bad neighborhoods, excessively far from city, or just old/bad quality.

The biggest cons I’m seeing are that I would be losing my current 3.5% interest rate and would be tying up almost all of my net worth in the house. The rest of my net worth is tied up in my 401k so I would have virtually no savings outside of those vehicles, such as in a taxable brokerage, other than my emergency fund.

My main question is what a reasonable rent value is. I see on here that 30% of gross monthly income is recommended, which is $1250. I otherwise see online that 30% of your gross income is recommended which is more like $1875. 

I think an ideal based on the above would be $1600-ish (0.3\*(75000/12)) - 300 for parking. Or look at something closer to $1250. Once you start factoring in utilities and parking, a lot of the ""rent"" that places post seems very variable - any advice on the search would be great.",What should I be allocating for rent?,1672689828

Hi all,

I am 24, originally from Ukraine, now I live in the US and have a green card.

I run an online teaching/consulting business that I have been growing for the last 7 years. Last year I made $175K, in 2021 it was $160K, in 2020 $120K. I think if i try hard, I could grow it to $250-300K, but probably it cannot scale beyond that. 

A part is active earned income (about $120 of last year’s 175K) and a part is income from my intellectual copyright property. That part is more or less guaranteed for the next 7-10 years.

Of this $175K, my tax bill is $45000, my spending is $40-45K, and I save the rest ($90 000). 

Here is the problem. I love Europe so much more. I traveled many countries, especially Eastern European ones, and love living there a lot better. And, I have a lot of friends all over Europe, including digital nomads.

Life in the US kind of sucks. It’s okay on a daily level, but the only walkable cities are expensive ones, and I want to stay frugal. Food is worse, entertainment is worse. To enjoy US as much I would enjoy Croatia or Spain, I need to spend exactly 5 times more or so.

My standard of living was higher even in Ukraine 5 years ago with $800 a month. Sure now I can buy a big house or car, but that doesn’t fix entertainment, food or weather. 

So, a part of me wants to move to Europe and surrender my green card. Especially if I could lower my taxes, not only would I save more by spending less, but also by wasting less in taxes! For example if my spending is cut by half with the same or better lifestyle and so is my tax bill (say, Bulgaria with a 10% flat tax), I will be saving $140 000 a year.

But, there are two problems with doing that.

1)Living in Ukraine, I had tremendous financial instrument problems. For example my clients couldn’t pay me cause PayPal wasn’t available, I couldn’t keep money in the bank because they go bankrupt and aren’t insured, I had no access to stock market or mortgages. 

So moving to a country like Montenegro with low taxes won’t solve this, while places like Lithuania, Portugal, or anything EU except a few exceptions are high tax. 

2)Citizenship. I could get a freelancer visa or even a Golden Visa soon, but I would prefer to work on citizenship, because the Ukrainian one is not safe and good enough.


But the biggest problem is my ambition. I am aware I am fortunate to have built this business. It’s amazing that at just 24 years old I could retire in most of the world! 

But, I want much more. I know people here in the US who make $5-10M a year, anywhere from finance to real estate. 

So, if I were to stay, I could start buying real estate. In 5 years, I could build a $3-5M portfolio cash flowing $100-200K a year extra and appreciating.

I think the US is not going to the right place, but it still offers the best protection and money creation tools unless you only build remotely. No other country offers fixed mortgages, you know your money will be safe, there will be no wealth tax, it’s easy to evict tenants. I know the American tax code, rules, laws and mentality and moving to Portugal, Bulgaria, Malta and whatnot will undermine these plans. It will take time to learn the local laws, locals have less money, it’s harder to work with the banks, etc. 

If I had a US citizenship, I would leave the country now, travel and leave in Europe, saving money with Foreign Earned Income Exemption, and would be building my real estate portfolio in the US. I would be coming to oversee the deals, and delegate the management.

So what should I do? The logical thing would be to surrender the green card now, and enjoy my best life. But the ambitious part of me would be very disappointed. I don’t have to be worth $50M in 15 years, but I know I have to be able to tell myself I did my best. 

Maybe start buying real estate and in 3.5 years take the citizenship and leave? If my earned income goes up so much that the US taxes become a problem, I would then renounce the citizenship and pay an exit tax.",Help choose the direction,1672684733

2401,personalfinance,"Hello everyone. 

So a little background, I am 20 years old, I work in commission sales and make a bit over $100k/year. My monthly expenses total out to at or below $4k (typically closer to $3500). I have zero debt so no car payment and credit cards are paid in full every month. I am maxing out my Roth IRA and always have money left over even on bad sales months when I may only make $5-6k. My emergency fund is fully funded, if not a bit over funded. I like to have an extra cushion in my finances since I’m on commission. I’m sitting on about $35k in cash and about $10k in investments (and growing) so far. 

Now my question is this:
 
The gym has been a passion of mine for a long time. I have set some fairly massive income goals for this year and want to keep myself on track. I went with one of the older gentlemen I work with to the incredibly fancy gym he goes to and absolutely loved the experience. It has *everything* there from a massive area to lift weights, to a sauna, cold plunge, rooftop lap pool, cafe, massage room, etc etc.

I was using an online calculator yesterday and saw an ad for High Yield Savings accounts (Ally, Capital One, etc.) I noticed that most of the rates were between 3% and 4%. I know that Capital One has variable rates, but have neglected to keep tabs on the interest rate, so I thought that it was good that they're keeping pace with other banks (I joined ING, and when Capital One Acquired them, they weren't as good about keeping interest rates competitive.)

When I checked my Savings accounts, they were only paying a 0.3% interest. I checked them all, and reached out to a friend to confirm that I was reading it right - he had the same rate. When he contacted their support today, they said that the only way to get the 3.3% new rate is to open a new account and close the old one. (It appears that they ""Changed"" the account from ""360 Savings"" to ""360 Performance Savings"" - although that may be unrelated.)

I would recommend that people who are current Capital One customers investigate their situation and let the company know that not adjusting the existing customer's rates to match their advertised offerings is poor customer service and puts business at risk.

So I recently had to return my car and the dealership explained that buying it would be my best option for lowest payments. I thought OK let's do this because I need a car anyway. Car was leased under my mom's name because she had better credit at the time. So the salesman tells me it has to be bought under her name to qualify for the 0 down buying option. I figure no big deal, I'll have her come sign the papers. He tells me the final number is looking like 590 a month! I ask why and he says her credit is too low and she was financed at 18%. I'm panicking but I need a car, and the lease options are higher than that so I say OK.. thinking I can sell the car in a few months and see what to do then. I'm an idiot I know, but I've also got my 2 kids with me, one of which is a baby and I'm juggling all of this so my brain is just telling me to finish this up. 

My mom comes and I need to get the baby changed so I tell her I haven't read the itemized pricing yet so don't sign that. She says OK she'll do that last. Well she signed anyway. Apparently the salesman just got her to sign all the papers quickly since the price was agreed upon. At this point there is no turning back. My lease end price was 17k and somehow between the mileage charge and dealership fee and other shit it ended up at 25k! How the fuck? 

So I'm stuck financing a 25k car at 18% interest. I WANT TO CRY. I don't know what to do because the contract clearly states there is no cooling off period, meaning once it's signed, it's binding. Am I going to have to sell this shit and take the hit of the difference? Like if I sell it for 20k I'm only on the hook for the other 5k? Or is the interest also due at once?

It has come to the point where I am a bit confused and in the middle of deciding whether to continue to invest in a Roth 401k (which I have been doing since graduating), and a Traditional 401k, which I believe I should start taking advantage of.

As of the end of 2022, here’s where I am:
- Age: 25
- Living: IL (4.95% state income)
- $153k Salary
- $130k NW: $30k HYSA (big purchases soon), $20k brokerage, $60k Roth’s, $10k Traditionals, $10k other (crypto, bonds, HSA, etc)

Future plans:
- Will likely marry in next 3 years, new combined income will be $225k+
- Expecting personal salary increase in 2023 to $165k+

I plan on maxing out 401k contributions in 2023. 

Based on everything I’ve read, I believe I am very close to being better suited for a traditional account because of my low(er) state income, high(er) tax bracket, and a large enough safety net of Roth when needed for larger distributions in retirement. However, some posts here have recommended that the 28%+ tax brackets are where traditionals help, and I’m also at a loss of trying to understand since I am so heavily invested how much my distributions will need to be in retirement. 

With this - I am leaning towards a 60/40 Roth/Traditional split, but am not super confident in this decision. I do believe a split of some sort is going to be right.

Now, I'd like to continue to sell off some more losses across VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBILX, but had some questions:

Unfortunately I didn't know the previous 30 days also impacted wash sale rules, and had auto re-invest on these funds, which mean some small amounts of shares came reinvested in December. I also have these same funds in my Roth and Rollover IRA accounts in vanguard.

What's the best way to handle this? 

1. Just sell anyway and let vanguard deal the wash sale shares on the tax form? (not sure how much this would complicate my taxes using TaxAct). I'd also need to make sure I understand how to carry forward the correct amount in the future that weren't qualified. (I'm not a tax expert and do my own taxes with TaxAct so this can get overwhelming for me)

2. Using specID in vanguard, I could not sell any of those shares from the last 30 days and wait to do that later?

3. Either way I guess I have to also turn off auto-reinvest in my retirement accounts as well for now?

My salary is $85,000 and I’ve been taking home roughly $5,100 monthly after taxes. I started working in September 2022.


Monthly expenses with new 2023 budget and a few explanations after:


|Category|2022|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rent|$400|$400|
|Car|$540|$540|
|Car Insurance|$100|$100|

|401K|N/A|$212|
|Roth IRA|N/A|$540|
|Total|$3160|$2792|


**Rent:** I live at home, but pay my family $400 monthly for my bedroom. 


**Car:** The car I’m driving now is technically not mine. It’s in my family’s name and the understanding is that it’s “mine” as long as I pay the monthly payments and eventually give them more for the “equity” I’m getting in it. 


It’s a 2015 4Runner with 95k miles. It’s completely decked out and worth $23-25k. My family has a 2.3% loan on it with $5,100 left. They want an additional $7,500 for them to officially sell it to me. 


I love the car and think it’ll be a great vehicle for me to drive until the wheels fall off. I’m not sure what the best strategy is in terms of financing it in my name (interest rates are quite high rn), so for the time being I’ve been paying their monthly payments and at some point will need to take out a loan. Any input here is appreciated!


**Food:** The $380 on eating out is partially me eating out a few times a week. It’s also a mix of me paying weekly to take my siblings out to eat and I’ve also had a few expensive meals. I took my dad to a nice dinner for his birthday ($200) and paid for my entire family on my grandmother’s birthday ($300). I enjoy taking my siblings out and want to continue, but limit to once a month or so this upcoming year. 


**Clothes:** I have gone overboard here. I work in a somewhat formal setting and didn’t have a decent wardrobe. I got several expensive silk blouses, wool pants, expensive shoes, backpack, and suitcase. This definitely was just an upfront cost thing and I don’t plan to be spending this much monthly here on out. 


**Other Comments:** I pulled all of my credit card transactions to make this monthly breakdown. It doesn’t completely add up to what I’ve taken home. I’ve combined a few things here and there, I have around $7,000 in my savings account right now. My company matches 25% of the first 6% for 401k. I also don't currently have a Roth IRA but plan to open one soon.


**Student Loans:** I have $27,000 in federal student loans and my family has a $12,500 parent plus loan I'll pay. These are all on deferment until August 2023.


||Amount|Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Personal Federal|$5,640|5.05%|

|Personal Federal|$7,500|2.75%|
|Personal Federal|$7,500|3.73%|
|Parent Plus|$12,500|6.28%|

I would love to take my family on a trip somewhere, start saving heavily for a down payment on a small house/condo.

2432,personalfinance,"Considering replacing my high mileage, 2006 Honda with a new vehicle this year. 

Either a Honda CRV Hybrid Sport 2WD or Toyota RAV4 Hybrid AWD (all Rav4 hybrid are all wheel drive, but I don't particularly need AWD). 

I have located a Honda dealer willing to sell an inbound CRV at MSRP 33695 + 995 dealer fee + tax/tags/etc. 

I have located a Toyota dealer willing to order from allocation a RAV4 at MSRP from their pipeline; unsure if any have factory accessories or packages, but the RAV4 without anything is 33570. This dealer has no fees, no markups, etc. Sticker + tax/tags/etc.  

Neither dealer can quote rates because it will depend what is offered at the time the vehicle actually arrives.  Rates are a little stupid now in general, but I should qualify for whatever the lowest offered is.  hoping to be somewhere around 5-6% on a 60 month loan. 

I would put 0 down, am not trading in my 2006 Honda. 

With taxes, fees, license, registration, it seems like I would be financing 36K and with an interest rate of 6% be paying right around $700 per month for total of payments after 5 years coming to approx 42K.  

Household income (myself and wife): $134,000 base up to 164,000 (part of my pay is variable commission plan).

Other income: **$1300 month dividends** but currently set to DRIP instead of using as income

I also am **reimbursed 62.5 cents per mile that I drive for work**. My current vehicle averages 20 mpg, the new hybrids are both approx 35 mpg, so my cost to operate them drops .  I can drive anywhere from 100 - 400 miles per week for work, but let's use 200 as an average. 800 miles per month is $500 reimbursed.  Fuel cost for 800 miles at 35 MPG and $3.50 per gallon is $80. My net reimbursement to cover car cost/depreciation/maintenance would therefore be about $420 per month. 

Cash accounts: $205K

Debt / Obligations

* Mortgage 245K at 2.625%. Insurance is insane on the house. PITI is **$2000** month. 
* Wifes car; 2020 Toyota financed at 2.99%.  Owe $12.5k on it, car has a fair market value of 20-22k, so no rush to pay faster.  Payment is **$410** per month currently
* Other expenses: Household bills (lawn care, electric, water company, pest control, cable, etc) **$400**
* FL Prepaid university/UTMA investing/529 savings contribution - **$300** 
* Groceries - **$500** 
* Car Insurance (paid 2x per year); 3 cars = **$500** per month combined.  

So that's a **little over $4000 per month in obligations**; maybe can save a bit on groceries, or step down the UTMA and 529 contributions (not likely to do so) but overall, not much we can do to alter our monthly ""nut"".

2440,personalfinance,"Looking for guidance on whether and when to file IRS Form 709 (U.S. Gift Tax Form) for a $10k I-Bond gift purchase for a non-spouse family member. As I understand the IRS rules, each person has an annual gift tax exclusion amount for “present interest” gifts to each non-spouse recipient (16,000 in 2022 and $17,000 in 2023).  However, there is a $0 limit on “future interest” gifts to non-spouse recipients, and you must file a gift tax return when you give “future interest” gifts to anyone except your spouse. 

It’s not clear to me whether I-Bonds you purchase as a gift for a non-spouse individual (using their SSN and TD account #) in 2022 but hold for delivery to that individual in 2023 count as a “present interest” gift in 2022 or a “future interest” gift in 2023.  In this case, a $10k “present interest” gift appears to not require Form 709 be filed, but a $10k “future interest” gift would require Form 709 (and in tax year 2022 or 2023?).

2441,personalfinance,"Hello,

I would love some advice on a savings conundrum…

I currently earn £70k per year but this is due to increase to £80k in February. I have £10k outstanding on my student loan, currently paying off around  £380 via salary repayments per month which is due to rise to just under £450 with my pay rise. The interest rate on student loans has just risen to 3.25% in-line with inflation. So will take me about another 2 years to pay off if I continue just salary repayments. I have never made any direct payments to my student loan.

I am also 16 weeks pregnant. I have been saving £500 per month for the past 5 months for our baby in a 5% interest savings account (currently have £2.5k). The original goal being to save up £10k between my partner and I to go towards nursery fees/ baby expenses by the time the baby is born.  I will have 6 months paid maternity leave from work so don’t need to worry too much about maternity leave, and most baby stuff we’ll be getting second hand/ getting some money from relatives so don’t need too much extra ££ for that as we can probably cover with our salaries.

However now that I have a sizeable chunk saved I’ve been looking at my student loan repayments and thinking…imagine having that extra £450 per month. I would really feel that - it would really cushion the blow with future nursery fees AND if I had it by the time I go on maternity leave I could potentially stretch my pay out for 9 months rather than 6.

So now I’m thinking, what’s the point of saving for the future when I could be overpaying student loan now and increase my salary by 10%?

So should I pay the £2.5k saved directly into my student loan and continue to divert £500/month to that instead, with a view to pay it off by the time I go on maternity leave in July? Leaving me with an extra £450pm from then onwards?

Other option is to continue saving £500pm in my 5% interest account until I reach the 5k limit.",Save £500pm in 5% interest savings account or pay off student loan (UK),1672678396

2457,personalfinance,"Hey all,

I made a bit of an error 3 days ago (12/30) when paying my Amex credit card bill online for a card I seldom use. When I was using the Amex app to make the payment ($30), I had noticed my saved checking account wasn't showing up. No biggie, I'll just enter it again. This is where I messed up by accidentally omitting one digit of my account number. The routing number was fine, since it showed the correct bank associated with my account. I had only noticed the error after I submitted the payment. At this point, I figured it'd probably just bounce since it's likely not a valid account. However, the Amex online system now shows the payment as ""paid"" (no funds were taken by amex from my account). So I call Amex to see if I can get the payment reversed and refunded since I'd assumed it was a real account that was debited. However, the support rep processes the refund to my actual account, and not to the ""fake/mistake"" account number that I erroneously inputted. I'm now being told that I have to wait a few business days before processing another credit refund. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that phone call I figure I might as well call my bank and see if they can help. My bank has an automated phone system that requests your account number when calling. Turns out, if you enter an account number that's invalid/not associated with an account, the automated system says ""it could not find an account with that number"" or something along those lines. When you enter a valid account number, it instead prompts you to enter your pin to access account information. Out of curiosity, I enter the number I had erroneously entered for payment to see what my bank's system would say, and it says it couldn't find an account with that number. So assuming the number I entered into the phone system was the ""fake/mistake"" number I made payment with, why would Amex mark it as ""paid"" when the payment was made with an invalid account.

2474,personalfinance,"This is a long read. So I apologize in advance but I want to get as much info in here as possible…  I  bought a used 2018 Wrangler JKU back in 2021… I love Wranglers (I know that many do not for one reason or 50 but I digress) 

Basically, I want to trade my 18JKU in for a 2023 JLU, this particular JLU has every bell and whistle my JKU doesn’t… it only has 25 miles on it, it is completely updated and up-fit with a factory Mopar kit (lift, wheels, shocks, tires etc) all the stuff I would normally do myself. Done and covered under factory warranty. It’s beautiful and mint and again…  brand spanking new.

I’ll get to the meat and potato’s already … I am considering a balloon loan - it’s the only thing holding me back from pulling the trigger. Why a balloon loan? The monthly on a regular finance would have me looking at very high monthly payments which doesn’t fit into my budget. Right now I finance my used car at $447 a month (just for comparison sake)  I put a small hold on the car on NYE and now I’ve just been thinking and thinking. I have nearly an 800 credit score as of today. While I sat at the dealership spitballing and sharing stories, I was informed that I was approved for a monthly payment through a CU for $431 dollars a month, which is less than what I pay now, the interest rate is %6.99 (I know that’s high but was expecting higher considering the state of the world) at the end of the balloon I would owe a little over 24k since the car comes out to 52k after all is said and done with the positive equity of my current vehicle trade value etc.

My thing is I tend to think on the catastrophic scale like, what if I lose my job and can’t find another? What if I fall into ill health, what if I can’t meet that 24k balloon in 5 years? My girlfriend understands my hesitation, at the same time she tells me “the positive is it’s a brand new car, yours already has had issues, and if everyone lived worrying about the future they’d never do anything in the now… also, we know the Wrangler would sell given their reputation, resale value and fan base.”

I know before the balloon comes within five years of saving (if I don’t get fired or something bad happens) that I’d have the money to pay it off if I continue the path I am on… but again - what if something happens. The salesman gave me his shtick of how his girlfriend balloons every 2-3 years with her Wrangler. Sure. But even if I have the 24k all saved up nice and warm what if I don’t want to dump that hard saved money into the final balloon payment?? I could refinance - yes… I could potentially sell the car, yes… but all these questions. Plainly put, is this balloon loan a dumb a** idea? Am I  going to ruin my finances? Is it going to destroy my credit that I work so diligently to maintain and protect? Should I just walk away? I know at the end of the day the final choice is mine… but man, I need advice. My cousin in law who is a good 20+ years older than me and has bought and sold and financed and has more experience with this said “it’s not really beneficial but whatever you choose to do I support you.” So I don’t have much going except the voice in my head saying “do it! It’s a new car, gone are the issues of the old one” vs “well new cars still have issues too and this a totally different type of loan”

I, 47m and my wife, 44, have been aggressively paying off our debt after a lifetime of financial irresponsibility (Credit Card Debt). Our household income is $180,000, and we each have about $100,000 in our 401ks. My 401k is maxing out due to being a teacher, and my wife is currently contributing up to the employer match, which is 6%.

We have stayed consistent over the last 2 years and have paid off approximately $60,000 in debt, with an additional boost of $100,000 due to my PSLF going through.

We are looking to finish paying off debt while investing in our future/retirement. This is what I have planned at the moment, and I’m curious if there is anything that would be better:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Finish paying $10,000 personal loan (Exp. Completion 3/23)

2. Pay off wife’s $36,000 student loan (Exp. Completion 1/24)

This leaves us with a $1300 a month house payment for 13 years

3. Build 3 months savings in HYSA (Exp. Completion 5/24)

4. Open and Max Contribute to Roth IRA for each of us (Starting May/24)

5. Start saving monthly (HYSA) for max lump payment for following year's Roth IRA contributions

6. Max out my wife’s 401k over the employer match (I think up to 12%)

7. Open a (60%-20%-20%) three-fund portfolio with VTSAX ($9000), VBTLX ($3000), and VTIAX ($3000) (Exp. Completion 5/25)

8. Pay $1000 a month into three fund portfolio at $600-$200-$200 (Starting 8/25)

At this point I would be 49 years old.

9. Start paying off house (at this point I would owe approximately $118,000 at 2.99%)

2523,personalfinance,"What is cash-out refinancing?

If you have equity in your home and need cash, you may be able to refinance your mortgage and get cash out. This is called a “cash-out” refinance.  


To be eligible for a cash-out refinance, you’ll need to have good credit and enough equity in your home. The amount of equity you have is the difference between the balance of your mortgage loan and the appraised value of your home.  


The new mortgage loan you’ll get from a cash-out refinance will be larger than your current mortgage loan. You’ll use the extra money to pay off other debts, make home improvements, or invest in something else.  


Before you decide to do a cash-out refinance, make sure you understand all the costs involved and weigh the pros and cons carefully.

## Pros and cons of cash-out refinancing

If you’re a homeowner with equity in your property, cash-out refinancing allows you to tap into that equity and receive cash in hand. It’s one way to use your home equity, but it’s not always the best option.  


There are some pros to cash-out refinancing, including the potential to:  


• Get a lower interest rate: If rates have gone down since you first took out your mortgage, you could save money by refinancing at a lower rate.  


• Reduce your monthly payments: If you’re struggling to make ends meet each month, lowering your payments can give you some breathing room.  


• Pay off high-interest debt: If you have credit card debt or other loans with high interest rates, you can potentially save money by using the cash from your refinance to pay off those debts.  


However, there are also some cons to consider before taking out a cash-out refinance, including:  


• You could end up owing more than your home is worth: If housing prices go down after you take out a cash-out refinance, you could find yourself “underwater” on your mortgage – owing more than your home is worth. This can make it difficult to sell or refinance if you need to do so in the future.  


• There are closing costs involved: As with any type of loan, there are closing costs associated with a cash-out refinance. These can add up

[https://mortgagedrill.com/cash-out-refinancing-is-one-way-to-turn-your-home-equity-into-cash-but-not-everyone-qualifies/](https://mortgagedrill.com/cash-out-refinancing-is-one-way-to-turn-your-home-equity-into-cash-but-not-everyone-qualifies/)

## How to qualify for cash-out refinancing

To qualify for a cash-out refinance, you’ll generally need to get your home appraised. The appraisal is an important part of the equation because it determines the maximum value of your home and, as a result, how much equity you have.  


In addition to needing equity, you’ll need to prove that you can make the monthly payments on your loan. Lenders will want to see proof of income, employment history, and credit score. They’ll also want to know what your current debts are and your debt-to-income ratio.  


If everything looks good and you’re able to meet all the requirements, you should be able to qualify for a cash-out refinance.

## Alternatives to cash-out refinancing

If you’re looking to access your home equity but don’t qualify for a cash-out refinance, there are a few other options available to you.  


Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) provide flexible access to funds, allowing you to borrow only what you need and making interest-only payments on the amount borrowed. However, HELOCs typically come with variable interest rates, so your monthly payments could increase or decrease over time.  


Another option is a home equity loan, which is a lump sum of cash that’s repaid over a fixed period of time at a fixed interest rate. Home equity loans can be used for one-time expenses like home renovations or debt consolidation.  


Finally, if you have good credit and enough equity in your home, you may be able to get a cash-out refinance with a private lender. Private lenders usually offer higher interest rates than banks or credit unions, but they may be more flexible with their eligibility requirements.","Cash-out refinancing is one way to turn your home equity into cash, but not everyone qualifies",1672654785

2541,personalfinance,"I was recently introduced to the Texas County District and Retirement System. This is a retirement savings plan offered to Texas government employees at all levels across the state. 

As far as I can tell, it seems to be essentially a fixed annuity. But I’m not clear beyond that. A few of my questions are: 

- Am I correct in characterizing this as an annuity?
- Assuming it is a fixed annuity, is it offered through insurance companies (like a typical annuity), or backed by the Texas government itself? 
- When is employer matching applied? At vesting, or at retirement? 
- When electing to “begin retirement”, if I chose not to take the regular payments and instead rolled a lump-sum disbursement of the account into an IRA, would that sum include the employer match? 

Right now, I am imagining the following: if I am fully vested, my employer match is 225%, I currently have $100,000 in my account, and I elect to begin my retirement benefits, then at that time my (now previous) employer adds an additional $225,000 to my account.

22 years old
Just graduated college
Zero debt
Savings of ~$50k (Full access to additional several hundred thousand dollars from parents)
I am an only child who will likely inherit $5-8 million
Career - Making $230k this year scaling up to around $400k in year 4 and $1m+ by year 8. The caveat is that while I am guaranteed a job for the first 4 years, it becomes harder to climb the pyramid as the levels progress. I am a top performer among the peers my age, however I have only been working for a few months so this is meaningless. The downside scenario in my career path is burning out into a different industry and making low-mid-six-figures (300-600k).

Future Goals:

We have no current desire to FIRE or retire early. I want to work as long as possible and build generational wealth, or simply make as much money as possible. Ideally, We’d like to retire with ~$60-80mm, counting the inheritances. I understand that I am only 22 and very naive. However, the industry I work in is pretty rigorous (80-100 hour work weeks) and it is said that most people figure out if they like it or not within the first few months on the job. I love it. And the hours only get better as you climb up the ladder. She is a 3rd year in med school and very confident in her career path.

My question to the people on here is how to approach this. I see a lot of posts on this subreddit about people in difficult financial situations and very few about building wealth. In terms of savings, We’re just going to pour it all in index funds. I do not have the time or willpower to manage real estate, and the benefits of real estate only become significant for very high earners and UHNW individuals. Is there any other advice people who have taken a similar approach to their finances (building generational wealth) can provide? When I do the math in excel, with my and my future spouses incomes, my goal seems extremely feasible , perhaps even too easy. However, obviously, very few people retire with 60-80 million so I’m curious what I’m missing. On the kids front, we do want kids and I understand that kids are extremely expensive.

Monthly expenses with a few explanations after:

|Category|2022|2023|

|Total|$3160|$2792|

**Rent:** I live at home, but pay my family $400 monthly for my bedroom. 

**Car:** The car I’m driving now is technically not mine. It’s in my family’s name and the understanding is that it’s “mine” as long as I pay the monthly payments and eventually give them more for the “equity” I’m getting in it. 

It’s a 2015 4Runner with 95k miles. It’s completely decked out and worth $23-25k. My family has a 2.3% loan on it with $5,100 left. They want an additional $7,500 for them to officially sell it to me. 

I love the car and think it’ll be a great vehicle for me to drive until the wheels fall off. I’m not sure what the best strategy is in terms of financing it in my name (interest rates are quite high rn), so for the time being I’ve been paying their monthly payments and at some point will need to take out a loan. Any input here is appreciated!

**Food:** The $380 on eating out is partially me eating out a few times a week. It’s also a mix of me paying weekly to take my siblings out to eat and I’ve also had a few expensive meals. I took my dad to a nice dinner for his birthday ($200) and paid for my entire family on my grandmother’s birthday ($300). I enjoy taking my siblings out and want to continue, but limit to once a month or so this upcoming year. 

**Clothes:** I have gone overboard here. I work in a somewhat formal setting and didn’t have a decent wardrobe. I got several expensive silk blouses, wool pants, expensive shoes, backpack, and suitcase. This definitely was just an upfront cost thing and I don’t plan to be spending this much monthly here on out. 

**Other Comments:** I pulled all of my credit card transactions to make this monthly breakdown. It doesn’t completely add up to what I’ve taken home. I’ve combined a few things here and there, I have around $7,000 in my savings account right now. My company matches 25% of the first 6% for 401k. I also don't currently have a Roth IRA but plan to open one soon. 

**Student Loans:** I have $27,000 in federal student loans and my family has a $12,500 parent plus loan I'll pay. These are all on deferment until August 2023. 

||Amount|Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|

|Personal Federal|$7,500|2.75%|

|Parent Plus|$12,5000|6.28%|

I would love to take my family on a trip somewhere, start saving heavily for a down payment on a small house/condo. I am not sure how long I will plan to live at home, but think if I play my cards right it can help set me up for success down the road.

Age 42; married; wife does not earn income; older kids from wife's first marriage (she's 12 years older than me) but they are out of the house and require no support.

Salary: $220k base with bonus between $8k-10k; 3% 401k match; employee plus spouse gold healthcare plan paid 100%.

Mortgage: $366k mortgage (FMV $515k) at 2.75% (1 year into 30-year refinance we did last year to get that rate); $2,154 monthly payment with $622 of that going to escrow.

Student loans: $107k at 6%; $10k at 7%; $18k at 4.45%.

Savings: $35k in traditional savings account.

Retirement: $6k in 401k; $6k in Acorns account (aggressive); $1k in Fidelity traditional IRA (spread among a few Vanguard funds).

Current savings plan is:

\- maxing out 401k ($22,500) to get employer match ($6,600);

\- maxing out traditional IRA ($6,500) and backdooring to Roth at the end of every year;

\- putting $2,600/month into Acorns account.

Please assume that the above is the maximum my current budget will allow.  The student loan payments are paused so it's easy to not bother with those at the moment, but when the resume, obviously it makes sense to start paying those down as aggressively as possible, shifting the entire $2600/month from Acorns into those payments.

Goal: to retire between 60-65 with $2M or more.  The ""or more"" is flexible based on the retirement year since the earlier I go the longer I'll have to float before I draw social security.  My preliminary plan is to wait until 70 to get the max.

My questions:

\- Would it be better to pay the mortgage down or to continue buying as the market falls with the expectation that we'll see the upswing as we did following 2008?

\- Shifting the $35k I have in savings into an online high interest savings account is a no-brainer, right?

\- How would you game out a retirement savings plan based on the above numbers?

The goal seems achievable, but I'm very much a novice as to all saving and investing options, so I want to see if I'm missing anything obvious (or not so obvious).

My company offers a great 401k match: 50% of every dollar I contribute, up to the annual contribution limit ($22,500 for 2023). For example, if I contributed $22,500, they’d put in $11,250. I am 100% vested immediately. I am 25 turning 26 and am pretty early into my career so I’m not currently in a place where I can max out the 401k yet. That said, it’s still super important to me to optimize my investing strategy!

My company will contribute $1000 per year to the HSA, spread across 24 pay periods. While I’m working on determining how much I want to contribute here, I want to mention that I have a healthy emergency fund that could cover my deductibles without stress.

Alright so with all that context, I’m wondering what advice you would give when it comes to sorting out how much to contribute to both the 401k and HSA. Ideally, I’d like to contribute 17% of my gross income into a Roth 401k to get an additional 8.5% pre-tax company match. 

On top of this, I’d be able to manage about a $50 per paycheck HSA contribution (totaling $1200 annually).

Happy New Year!
       I'm posting this here because I frankly think this topic deserves some sort of place within both financial goals and student loan debt considerations.I am currently 44 y.o., single, with no kids and need to return to school for a bachelor's. Though I'm just now starting taxes and final figures haven't come yet, between two jobs, l earned a bit more than 75K last year. My current FT  is a 5 yr contract gig with 3 yrs left on it. I never expected to earn this, but while I'm making it, I wanted my empolyers' matches (both employers match retirement funds in pre-tax money).  What I am just now realizing is what a mess this might leave me in with regard to my REPAYE plan. I first attempted school in the late 90's, but didn't finish due to borrowing limits. At the time, I was faxed with the choice of either borrowing privately or repaying the debt. Ever since, I've been on a roller coaster of repayment woes, but during this payment pause, I've paid ~21K on my one time high of 69K of srudent loan debt. The Dept of Ed says they're expecting recertification in June? Sept?, and I'm now concerned that I won't qualify. 

Since I recently decided to return to school, I've been trying to reshape my finances to suit a FAFSA.  Needless to say, my EFC needs work. But the school I've chosen is an in-state public one, so it's fairly affordable at ~ 2K per semester and I can basically afford to pay cash for a while. If there is one lesson I learned from the first time around , it's following the advice that school shouldn't cost more than I'm able to earn in 3-5 yrs.

I'm STEM, so my old classes are too old to receive credit for. I'm basically starting over, and I kind of need to make quick work of things, as my FT contract will end and put me back into the job market in 3 yrs. With that said, I've been in healthcare and am hopefully prepping for nursing school, so the transition will be brutal, but hopefully relatively brief.

I need these results to be FAFSA friendly. I may have elderly parents living with me at spme point, but I am a self supporting non traditional student.

Here's what I'm working with currently:

401K and 403B- about 50/50 Roth/before tax ~78K
Roth IRA -5K
529- new
Savings of various kinds ~ 15K 
Taxable brokerage (liquidating to move into 529)-9K


All the reading I've done recently about making a transition like this says that I basically need to spend down the cash, which includes an emergency fund, a new car fund and the like, which I'm basically not ready to do yet. I don't want to delay starting school for aforementioned reasons, but I need to ensure that as I cut back gradually from work, my income is moving in the right downward direction down and/or more ""Roth-like"" to avoid non qualified FAFSA income while my bills stay paid.

I also slowed down on student loan repayment now that at least I've paid almost all the capitalized interest I've accrued to date. Whenever interest restarts, hopefully I will have struck a decent balance between saving for a return to school in my 529 and dropping my amt owed to a decent level that I can pay while in school.

Was pre-approved for a loan with my wife. After a year of being out-offered on houses (about 15 offers on houses), we finally got an offer accepted. It seems like a blessing in disguise as it’s the area where we wanted to live in because the schooling is great for our daughter when she’s older.

Because it’s been so long finding a house, I slacked big time on preparing my bank statements for months…after reading on Reddit and google and what not, it seems lenders will deny me instantly for my bank statement alone because it’ll seem I spend way too much. But I hope they know it’s because we live at my parents and aren’t paying rent, so I’ve had extra money to spend (and also spent money on gambling that I shouldn’t have). But I figured as long as I pay my CC every month, it wouldn’t matter cause I’ll make back whatever I lose. (I’ve also deleted the gambling app the second I was approved) it was moreso my form of entertainment rather going to bars.

My DTI is 9%. My CC debt is like 300$ (which I can essentially pay off right now) and my car payment is like 300$ a month. I also pay 350$ on storage fees for our belongings (obviously that’ll end once we get into a home). I also have enough money for the down deposit, closing costs and a few months of mortgage payments in my savings.

I guess I’m just really worried about my bank statements with the spending this year living at my parents (November I gambled a bit too much, probably 2000$) and wondering if my DTI will save me, along with being on the loan with my wife? Or will they instantly deny me because of how many times I’ve gambled?

This pulls in a living salary, that covers all my food rent and expenses, but leaves maybe £100 a month for savings - which I do religiously. 

It also comes with an amazing pension, but I’m in my early 20s so a while before I will reap the benefits of this 

I understand the sacrifice I have made with this, and getting to do something I love is worth it, however it is hard to see how I will ever achieve financial independence with this little in savings and an eventual wage cap with how much I can earn in this sector (not a lot higher than it is currently) 

Additionally, whilst the salary is enough to live on, it’s not really enough to do anything fun, such as trips and nights out etc. 

My main questions are: how do I save the most from my salary, where is best to put it (it’s all my left over income so it is emergency funds) 

How do I make some additional money, potentially using my degrees, in my spare time or as a form of passive income? I know there are no get rich schemes really, but get financially independent and secure in the medium run would be great",How to save and earn extra income?,1672615731

The airline asked me to go to the airport in my city and pick it up between 11am and 12pm today, 1/1. Basically the flight came in at 11am with my bag and they had no other flights that day, so staff was leaving at 12pm. I had to cancel new years day plans to meet this 11am-12pm window. I found my bag at the baggage claim today. I never saw an employee, otherwise I would've probably complained. I tried to see someone at the front desk, to no avail. Their phone number for the airport doesn't even work. 

I've talked to corporate customer service over a messenger app, as that is the only means of communication with this airline. They had me complete a form with receipts about items I bought because of the lost bag, as well as items in the bag. I haven't heard back in almost 1 week.

As far as they know, my bag could still be missing and/or stolen. I'm usually someone who plays by the rules, and my original plan was to only ask for reimbursement for the items I had to purchase for the 2 weeks my bag was missing, then just move on.

However, I'm tempted to use their bad customer service/bag tracking abilities against them. I'm just not sure how. What should I do? Insist that my bag is missing still? Maybe they will offer a greater refund. Being without my bag for 2 weeks and receiving near radio silence from the airline was very unsettling. That bag had food I made for my family in it (which is disgusting now). It had developed family photographs from 2008 I thought were gone for good. It had christmas gifts I had to replace.

Hey all,

I am a travel nurse and I am currently working for a travel agency that isn't ""based"" in the US. I say ""based"" because they have an office here, but it looks to be in some run down building based on google maps. All of the employees are indian and my recruiter seems to be based out of india based on the times she calls/texts me.

When signing up with the agency, under their benefits page it asked me how much I wanted to contribute to my 401k and I put in 15% of each check. Thought everything was done.

I checked my first check and saw 15% of my pay went to my 401k (there's a line item that says 401k plan - $_ _ _. _ _). I thought great. I don't tend to check my 401k and especially didn't want to this year d/t the volatility of it.

I logged into my account today and saw the total and was shocked at how it was. It was less than the last time I looked at the beginning of the year. I know, my fault for not checking.

But then I looked back at my checks and it seems that despite it saying money was placed in a 401k, it looks like it never went anywhere. My checks are the same size as if there was no 401k line item.

My boyfriend was not afforded the same education in finances as I was. It seems like he can’t stand to have $1 in his pocket. He has made big steps forward throughout our relationship and I commend him for that. 

Here’s my dilemma. A few years before we met, he burned his foot badly. I think he was around 22/23 yrs old. Badly enough to where he had to be taken to the nearest burn unit in SA, TX on an army base. (He is not in the armed forces, but that’s where it was). From what I’m told they had to sign a bunch of paperwork for him to be seen and he was in such pain that they just signed whatever so he could be seen. Come to find out he wasn’t on any sort of insurance. 

Now he has $25,000 of medical debt owed to the department of defense. 

He has called to talk with them about a plan and well they aren’t really accommodating to say the least. Our options were to pay in full, have a payment plan of $700/month (which we can’t afford), or (in his words) send them a check and hope it’s enough to settle. 

My first question is: would they really just tell us to send them a check in hopes it’ll be enough? Or did he misunderstand them? Bc it’s been a sore spot for a bit. 

Secondly: what are our options? I’ve tried looking into it but I can only get so far since we aren’t married.

2715,personalfinance,"A few years ago I bought a $7,500 Subaru Outback as a broke college student with plans for it to last 5 years and then buy a Tacoma. Unfortunately, it's on its last legs 2 years earlier than planned.  I'm looking to get a car in the next couple months and would like some advice.

For background, I work as a remote software engineer in the mountains.  I don't drive the car much on a day to day basis other than groceries, going to the gym, etc.  However, I very frequently drive on rough roads for mountain biking, backcountry skiing, camping, desert climbing trips, etc.

Monthly budget:

* Monthly take home pay after max 401k for company match, taxes, etc:  $5800
* Rent + utilities + wifi: $1800
* Food: $300
* Gym + subscriptions: $100
* Random things that come up: $300-$400
* Everything else gets thrown in a HYSA while I build up emergency fund and savings for car

Financials:

* Credit score: 800
* \~4 month emergency fund
* $16,000 saved for a car down payment sitting in a HYSA

The problem is, I have \~$40,000 of student loans. $20k private at 4.2% and $20k federal at 4.4%. Since graduating a year ago, I've only paid \~$300 a month towards the private loans while building up an emergency fund and a little bit of savings. I haven't paid anything on the federal loans because they're all deferred and not accruing interest for now anyways.

My question is, what type of car should I get? The dream is a new Tacoma because it would allow me to do all the hobbies I like, they last forever, and they retain their value super well.  I'd have no problem keeping the car for the next 250,000+ miles. This would be roughly \~$40,000.  I thought about used ones, but they hold their value so well that used Tacomas are insanely expensive.

Another alternative is a new Subaru Outback for \~$32,0000. This would get me most of the way with my hobbies, but I know I would eventually want to upgrade for more off-roading capabilities and truck stuff. I'm not sure how much money I would be losing in the long term if I know that I'm going to want to upgrade in the relatively near future anyways.

3rd alternative would be buying a used beater Outback or something similar with all cash. My concern with this is that while it is getting better, the used car market is still ridiculous.  I'm still scarred from dumping money on maintenance into my current car only for it to die in a couple years while also not letting me go all the places I want to go.  Plus, there are huge maintenance costs that tend to pop up around 100k miles (head gaskets, etc).

So far, the options I have seen are HYSA, CDs, and T-Bills. Since I have a few months, I was eyeing the 13 week T-Bills as a safe investment that have a decent yield currently (Vanguard lists the APY as 4.4%). My thought process being I put in maybe $35k of the $46k I have saved into the bills for that 13-week period and get whatever return I can while still keeping my investment very safe. My question basically is am I thinking over this enough? I was keeping around $10k related to this student loans savings in case something bad were to happen. Is that really possible or should I still feel comfortable putting that entire amount in T-Bills? Or should I be using a different investment vehicle entirely?

2747,personalfinance,"Hey all,  


I'm 26 and I'm seeking to retire as soon as possible in a relatively safe way.  


I'm making $56,000 a year, but if you factor my employer contributions for retirement, I make $61,160. My employer puts 10% of my salary towards my retirement plan and I put an additional 5% out of my base $56,000 a year towards my retirement. As of last month, I have nearly 8k in my retirement account, but it constantly loses value, it's a target date 2060 fund ( FDKLX).   


Outside of the 15% contribution of my salary, I've started putting roughly 1k out of my 3080 net home pay per month (I only get 12 paychecks a year), towards an index fund that tracks the S &amp; P 500 (SWPPX) and I've been able to do this 2 months in a row, to about 2k.   


I've got a home valued at $123,000 (yes, that's the actual taxed value) with a $41,300 mortgage on it with a payoff in 2039. I've got a $13,100 personal loan that is paid off in 2028. I've also got 4k in credit card debt. No student loans or car loans. The minimums for all debt is about 850 a month.  


the 13,100 personal loan was for home repairs (new roof, foundation fixing, new HVAC system, replacing extensive water damage in bathroom and utility room resulting in a complete gutting). It was used in combination with my credit card and personal savings.   


I still need to replace the sewer line (roughly 6k), replace the garage roof (unknown estimate at this time), and get electrical up to code (roughly 5k) in the next 5-7 years.   


I am relatively healthy and I do my own car work and I drive a 21 year old car (almost 22), taxes are dirt cheap (like 20 bucks a year cheap), and insurance is also cheap for it. When this car fails, I will buy another older car and work on it. I've been using this car for about 4 years and put in about 3k to get it working/street legal to drive.  


I have a long term partner who lives with me and earns about 31k a year. They contribute about $350 a month towards utilities and pitch in sometimes for food. They spend much more than me on debt compared to income/assets:  
4k in medical debt, roughly 11k in student loan debt.  


The average income per capita in my area is only about 35k and household is around 50k average and my household earns about $87,000 with a total household debt of about $73,400.  


1: I have a bachelor's degree and have completed 4/10 classes for my master's. My bachelor's was in social sciences and my master's is going to be in cybersecurity. I currently work in I.T. involving project management, database admin, and dev work in higher education. I take about 1-2 classes a year, then a break. This is to avoid student debt.   


Should I rush this more? I can tackle the subject very well (I have a 4.0), but each class is about 2.5k.  


2: My target date retirement fund is always losing money. I try not to look at day to day performance of an fund, but I am getting antsy with this. I know the idea is that riskier investments earlier in the fund pay off later towards 2060, but I don't know to gauge the performance.  


3: Roughly 1/3rd of my net income goes to investing, 1/3rd to paying debt, the remainder is split between cost of living (food, gas, bills) and savings (usually to put into the house).   


Is this acceptable? So far it it has worked with me. There was a period of time (2020 to mid 2022) where I was putting nearly all my income towards the house. Thankfully it's safer now.  


4: I'd like to retire in my 50s, does this seem possible?  


5: I'd like to possible get a 2nd stream of income, but I don't want to make my life miserable. I've been looking into doing work for a cyber tech startup, but it's a demanding field. A lot of higher paying jobs want me to have certificates that I struggle or earn, or more experience (I've only got a year of exp in this field).

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

Which path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?

Forgive me as I may have forgotten some detail, but the story went something like this: girlfriend put $10k to cover the down payment/closing costs of the home. The two of them agreed to split that evenly down the road (at the time, the boyfriend did not have enough to cover his half). As time goes, the boyfriend made purchases towards major appliances for the home, totaling $X. His initial thought was that his $5k portion he owed his girlfriend for the down payment would be reduced by $X. I initially thought the same, but there were people on here that said he would still owe his girlfriend $5k…the problem is I can’t remember the logic behind it and I am randomly now trying to remember this story and the logic as I wake up on New Years Day 😂.

New person to Reddit here after some help…

27(M) with a child living in England in a 2 bed house at current. 

After spending my earlier years not understand or caring to understand money, racking up lots of credit card &amp; loan debts and some remortgaged. I’ve got myself into a much better financial situation. Heading into 2023 with a clean slate with no debt apart from mortgage &amp; sub accounts although some of that was debt. 

Reading ‘how to own the world’ by Andrew Craig was a great insight and awakening for how little I knew how about the game of money. 

So….

SET UP - 

Income after tax/NI  - £2500
Average income with overtime after tax/NI- £2800

Bills - 
£1250-1500 (depending on 4/5week month)

Sub account 2 - £14,357.85 @ 2.44%
Sub account 3 - £14,625.92 @ 2.44%
Sub account 4 - £17,284.69 @ 2.69 % 

Planned to overpay mortgage by £100pm starting off with sub account 4. I did think about putting this into a savings account with higher interest but with the interest calculated daily I assume it’s better off to pay it direct?

2786,personalfinance,"Before people  say 6 months worth of emergency expenses, because I understand that is the general rule, I'm asking as a way to maximize my savings and am looking for another viewpoint or perspective as I'm not always right. Below is my background. This is going to be long and if you do read to the end, I appreciate that. I'm a 26 year old whose parents were excellent at budgeting and saving but not so much at making their money work for them, which is something I am trying to learn more about.  I am also married but my husband and I keep our finances separate as we have different views and emotions regarding money. 

I currently making $4,400 take home from the Navy and just got a part time job that will pay anywhere from $500-800/month take home. I have zero intention of spending the extra money from the part time job and it will all go to a HYSA. 

I currently have $12,000 in my savings account that accrues about $9/month. Not a lot of money but it's something. I am expecting to get a payment of $17,00 this year in July which plays into factor for some of my options. The $17,000 is not a re-enlistment bonus, it's funds from college fund that will be paid to me once I finish my Bachelor's degree so I don't think I will be taxed on it, but I could be wrong. 

I think it's also worth noting that I have a car payment of 500/month; I pay an extra $200/month on it to pay down the principal(4.49% interest). 35% of my loan is paid off, I currently owe $19,000 and I am hoping to get it under $10,000  by the end of this year. My monthly expenses for the mortgage, utilizes, and pet care totals $1,200 a month as well. I save $300/month but that number should go up with the new side job. 

I leave myself about $1,600-$1,800/month for gas, groceries, gifts, pets, normal daily expenses.

I also keep a sinking funds, right now I am at $1,000 and my goal is to have $2,500 in it before July. Lastly, because I'm trying to cover bases on where my money goes, I put $200 into the stock market every month and $150 into my TSP, which I never see but I added it so people don't think I'm choosing to overlook retirement in its entirety.

I am looking into opening a CD with Navy Fed as it earns 4.30% APY. The only downside is the money will be locked in for a year. I am also considering opening a HYSA with American Express(3.30% APY). I currently have two credit cards with them and think they have great customer service. I have made a pay chart with showing my options in terms of amount for each based on what I put into it, as well as the interest accrued within a year. Also, if I did the calculations wrong feel free to correct them in the comments. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for advice on a lot of things, I will summarize them because I know this was long. If you read this far, I really appreciate it. I know a lot of you have more knowledge and experience in this. I can't ask my parents, their strength lies in their budgeting skills and I have gotten a lot of help on budgeting from them. 

1. How much money should I actually keep on hand? I get paid regardless of what happens to me so the six month rule does not seem the best ""fit"" for me right now. 
2. Should I put more money in my CD? I am pretty risk averse and feel comfortable putting $5,000-$7,000 in a certificate. However, I feel a little more comfortable with the money I'll be getting this year between my college fund and side job funds. 
3. Not a question but if anyone has any HYSA's they'd like to recommend, I am open to it and feel free to leave them in the comments
4. Am I spending too much a month? I know that is a lot for people but I enjoy eating out and buying things for my pets. It makes me happy and I don't feel I'm going broke because of it. 
5. If you feel comfortable answering, what would you do in this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

If you got to the end and read everything, thank you! I appreciate the help and perspective!!! Happy New Years!

I really need your help. 

I took out a loan back in 2019 and paid it off by the scheduled time in 2020. I never missed a payment and received a letter saying my balance for the loan was at £0 meaning I had nothing left to pay off. 

COVID completely destroyed my family. My dad was incredibly vulnerable due to a whole list of health problems and legally needed 24 hour care so we we went into our own personal bubble from March 2020 until 2022. Unfortunately he had to be hospitalised in April 2022 and whilst in the hospital caught COVID, which killed him. 

Me and my mum were his full time carers over the 2 years of COVID so as you can imagine things have been pretty rough. I had no need to check my credit score until late 2022 where I found out that I’d apparently not paid off the loan and had an outstanding amount which was unpaid for TWO YEARS. 

My credit score is ruined. It was really good before this as I’d taken out loans to build it up and always paid them off. I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to finances and I haven’t found the courage to ring them yet.  

Is this something they can fix? I looked back on my bank statements and there was one month where the payment was reversed due to my bank account not having the funds, but I knew that at the time so immediately put the funds into the account and then it was taken afterwards.

The biggest thing for me is I received the letter confirming it was paid off, and have had no correspondence to say otherwise since.

I know I need to ring them but I’d love to hear what you think the outcome is going to be, so I don’t walk into that phone call with my hopes up and get crushed. I’m going to university this year and I’m worried I won’t be able to get accommodation with how bad my credit score is now, if any landlords require a credit check.

2801,personalfinance,"Hi, I have a few questions regarding marital assets and spouses estate. 

First off, many sources discussing Massachusetts suggest that ‘Marital property refers to all property, rights, and assets acquired during the course of the marriage, regardless of which spouse actually acquired them. ‘

However, Massachusetts, also is a common law state. I read that ‘Under a common-law property system, each spouse is considered a separate individual entitled to their own property. That means any income earned and property acquired is owned by whichever spouse’s name is on the check or property title.’

I am confused by these two things. I’m not sure what we should consider as marital property/assets. Can someone clarify and help me understand what marital assets (vs separate property) are in MA????


The second part of my question is, if my spouse were to pass before me, will marital assets be distributed to his estate, or will his estate consist of only separate property?",Help understanding marital assets vs separate property in common law state (MA) and estates,1672575840

Debts:

* Car she walked away from (Mercedes E Class 2016) that is financed in my name - **Owe $32K**, 4 appraisals at $21-$23K - **$10K negative equity.** $560/mo at 6% interest. I have no intention of keeping this car
* My daily driver car (Honda Accord 2018) - **Owe $17K**, $400/mo at 4.9% interest. 37 months remain.
* Amex: **Owe $20K** across 4 cards. I closed the accounts once the divorce was finalized. 
* Capital One Credit Card: **Owe $2.5K** 
* PenFed Personal Loan (Home Improvement): **Owe $24K**  $400/mo at 11.9% interest. 
* Student Loans: **Owe $17K**, $260/mo at 10.9%
* Home we shared: **Owe $270K**, $2010/mo at 5.5%. My new job will take me out of the area (from Houston to Dallas/Fort Worth), so I planned on renting this out at a break even. Purchased in late 2021, virtually no equity at the moment.

I started to apply this past week to jobs out of state. I currently live in that research triangle and to move out west a bit. Mostly applying to Denver and Colorado springs. 

I just had my company cut most of their contracts. But just after a week of applying I already have 3 places interested enough for phone screening. That during that holiday so I can only imagine it's going to pick up even more into the new year. 

My goal is to not move unless I get a offer for 60-65k. I don't see a reason to stay at $55k. I personally think my current company owes me a raise but I for sure know they don't want to. 

My concern is the economy. My recent hires are often first to go. If I move states away and a recession hits I could be without a job in a new city. This same scenario happened to me due to COVID after college. My first job last 2months before the company cut every contract. Then during lockdowns I couldn't find a job for 3 months.

2852,personalfinance,"So my wife has a couple of jobs (the woman works way too hard, but nobody can talk her out of it), and in one job she maxed out her 401k contributions this year. 

In her other job, she hasn’t been checking her paystubs in a while (between 2 jobs and us starting our own business she just never got around to it) and yesterday looked at one.

What she found was that, without her knowledge, she was signed up for the companies 401k program, and they’ve been taking money for it for several months.

Her employer doesn’t have an explanation, other than that she should have been receiving emails about it. We searched, but found no emails regarding the 401k.

She is a little over $3000 over the yearly limit because of this, and the employer says it will cost us $195 to get the money back.

My opinion is that as she never signed up for it (the employer thinks the person entering her information when she started accidentally entered it) that she should be able to get the money back without paying anything.

To be clear, the employer has admitted that she never signed up for it. They feel she should have noticed it earlier, and I’m guessing that this is why they want her to pay the $195. However, that’s a standard amount, regardless of how much was contributed, so the $195 would be the same charge even if she noticed it the first time.

Am I right in thinking that this is a problem for the employer to solve (and handle any charges if necessary)?",Wife signed up for 401k without her knowledge,1672538794

I have been looking for this answer, but can't seem to find it, so I hope someone is able to help...

If I have a 13-week treasury bill (held at treasurydirect.gov) that is maturing on 4/6/2023 and I want to convert that bill to a 26-week treasury bill after maturity, how do I go about doing this on treasurydirect.gov?

Is it possible to place a buy/bid on the 4/3/2023 auction date and then depend on the cash being available from the matured t-bill on the 6/4/2023 settlement/maturity date?

If not, does that mean the cash from the matured t-bill has to sit for a week before I can use it to buy the new 26-week t-bill at the following weeks auction?

If it is possible to buy the new 26-week t-bill in the same week as the old 13-week t-bill matures, do I have to make sure that the ""Maturity Payment Destination"" is ""Zero-Percent C of I"" and not a bank account?  Would I then also have to make sure the order for the 26-week t-bill has ""Zero-Percent C of I"" as the ""Source of funds""?  Any other thing I have to do to make sure it works?

Perhaps I am going about this the wrong way and there is, perhaps, some other way to do this more gracefully?

For the C1 card I use YNAB to track my regular spending and pay off whatever I’ve currently spent in the month which is typically more than what they’ve calculated as the minimum payment due.

When I make the payment on current spending it gives me the option to cancel the upcoming auto pay for the minimum due. I typically choose to cancel the auto pay if my payment will exceed the minimum due. Is that the correct way to treat the minimum payment or should I be making payments for current spending + accrued interest + minimum payment amount? Or do I cancel the minimum payment auto pay, and apply that amount to the other card balance I’m trying to pay off first?

Currently they do not bring in a lot of income and since I have a stable one, I have decided to take over their mortgage to help them out. However, there are a lot of moving parts and I saw some ""disturbing"" things with their mortgage. 

They owe about \~200k in principal, but so far this year, only \~4k of that balance is paid off and instead 7.3k on interest and 8.5k on taxes. So it seems like they are barely touching their balance. In fact, they took out a loan of 216k back in 2006 and their current principal is still 200k. I'm wondering if this is even worth paying off or we should just sell the house and move into a smaller home where the finance is much more reasonable, manageable, and doable.

They (now I) pay 1.6k/month and the breakdown is, they pay 300 in principal, 550 on interest and 750 on escrow. Did they get screwed over on this loan?

2896,personalfinance,"Hi all! I want to start this off by saying I'm a huge dumb idiot and this is a ridiculous situation I've gotten myself into. Haha 🥲

Anyway, I have a bunch credit card debt that's slowly been racking up over the years. Last year I wanted to get serious about paying it off so I applied for a Happy Money consolidation loan. I'm a big stupid moron so I only put about half of my debt (the cards with the highest interest rate) on it to ""try it"", not realizing that you can't add to this loan later. I love Happy Money and I wish I'd just put all of my debt on that at once. Boo.

Now I basically have this massive Happy Money account and then 3 other smaller credit cards, all totaling about $27k. About two months ago I learned about Accredited  Debt Relief and I was like ""oh that sounds cool"". I did a bit of research and they have good reviews, so I thought why not. All of my credit cards and the Happy Money loan qualified, so I thought this would be a good option.

The first thing they tell you to do is stop paying your credit card/loan bills, so I've done that. This is where I'm kinda getting cold feet. I really hate not paying my bills and watching my credit score drop. I've been getting calls and letters and it stresses me out. I've heard that the best thing to do is just trust the program but I'm still nervous.

I've also recently received a letter from Best Egg in the main for a pre-approved personal loan at 8.99% APR that would cover up to $50k. So...should I abandon ship with Accredited Debt Relief, get this other loan, and pay off all my stuff with this?!?! Or at least pull out 3/4 of the qualifying cards/loans from A.D.R. (one of the loans looks like it might reach a settlement soon). Previously I was having trouble getting approved for another debt consolidation loan because I'd applied for the Happy Money one too recently...I'm just nervous and in over my head and I feel like I'm making a bad situation worse lol.

So I opened an account with Betterment, since I saw good reviews for them. I was going to use them to save up for a trip to see my bf in December, save some money to help my parents when they're older, and then one for general investing in the future. Like for a house, new car, etc. I've looked at their IRA's for retirement and I have no idea what I'm looking at even though it's been explained to me 20 times. My employer doesn't have a 401k plan (that I've been told of, I'll ask her tomorrow), so I heard it's best in that case to open an IRA account. Is that true? And if so, my bank (Regions) has investing options as well, could I use my bank? Is it better to use my bank or something like Betterment?

Now, I don't bring a lot of money in monthly. Most of it goes to bills, and paying my car monthly, and helping my family out, so I didn't want to put in a lot but just little by little to get me started. For Betterment I was thinking of putting $5 in to each account bi-weekly. Would that be a good start?

Mrs. Someone gave us a check as a Christmas gift, but that check is not from her personal bank account, it's from her LLC's bank account.

Since Mrs. Someone's LLC isn't my husband's employer, but my husband's employer's employer, is that check considered a gift (and therefore not taxable income, at least not for the recipient) or a bonus (and thus considered taxable income)?

This is especially important to us as we've received the APTC subsidy for our monthly health insurance premiums this year and this check would put us above our estimated income for 2022, therefore requiring us to make repayments.

From what I've gleaned from internet research, gift tax is payed by the gift giver unless the gift recipient agrees to pay it instead, and neither party have to pay it unless it equals or exceeds the amount of the annual gift tax exclusion ($16000 in 2022), which in this case it does not.

Am I right in concluding that this counts as a gift, not income, despite being given by a business?

Does  the capital gains tax rate work like income tax - you pay a given rate  for all income within each rate threshold - OR is it the case that as  soon as your income crosses the earning threshold, you pay capital gains  taxes on *all* of your capital gains (even those below the income threshold for that rate)?

Here's an example to clarify:

In  2022, the capital gains tax rate is 0% until a single filer earns  $41,676 at which point is shifts to a 15% capital gains tax rate. Let's  say I earn $40,000, and I have capital gains of $2,000. Would I have to  pay the 15% capital gains tax on *all $2000*  of my capital gains, or would I pay 0% on $1,676 of my capital gains,  and only pay 15% on the $324 in capital gains that pushes me over the  $41676 income threshold?

I have  searched for ages to find an answer to this but am stumped. Online  calculators differ in how they calculate it and I can't find any solid  guidance. Thanks!","Does Capital Gains Tax apply to all gains, or only those over the income threshold for that rate?",1672517211

I have a little money left to spend, and an FSA card that Amazon recognizes for those kinds of expenses. There are specific items I want, that I think they should be listed as FSA/HSA eligible (filters for a CPAP machine, for example) but they are not. 

Similarly, I’d like a blood pressure monitor, but there are some models listed as eligible, and some that aren’t; the one I want isn’t eligible and the card rejects the purchase. Weird. 

1) is Amazon the true decider of what is eligible vs what isn’t? A personal bp monitor is a personal bp monitor, regardless of manufacturer, right? 

2) Assuming I make the purchase with a personal account and then request reimbursement, what happens if the item(s) exceed the remaining balance - will I get at least reimbursed to the balance, or only to the items that stay under?

2943,personalfinance,"I'm curious how folks here process saving for college and balancing out giving children options/risks of over-saving/valuing private colleges.  My partner and I are fortunate to have a good, steady income and are currently maxing out our tax-protected retirement accounts.  Both of us were also lucky enough to graduate college without any significant debt (one of us did four years at a private college, the other did 2 years private/2 years public) thanks to parental support.  On one hand, we want to give our children the same opportunities but on the other hand, looking at projected costs it's hard to fathom that a private school is providing adequate value for the cost difference.

I've put together a projection in excel to help us plan for our 529.  If our kids follow the standard timeline (i.e. no gap years), they'd be entering school in Fall of '29 and Fall of '31.  

By my projections the future value for four years of private school would be around $440K (1st child) and $465K (2nd child) while public school would be around $160K/$170K.  If we were to fully fund each child's 529 to plan for private school and they attended public school instead, each of the 529s would be left with over $325K after graduation.

Obviously there are options for that leftover money including graduate school, rolling it over into their own children's (or other relative's) 529s, and now rolling it into Roth's, but on the other hand, $650K is a significant chunk of change to wrap up in an account where non-qualified withdrawals are penalized.

2947,personalfinance,"I have been managing my elderly mother-in-law’s finances for a year now, after her husband passed away. He did the majority of the bill paying so I took over the job to help her out. They had no savings and were both reliant on social security as their sole income. With his passing, she now only makes about $950 from social security each month.

She drains her bank account to zero whenever the social security payment hits each month and barely squeaks by. For Christmas, she decided to buy us and several family members gifts from the Montgomery Ward catalog using their credit. My mother in law is a very nice woman, but I guarantee she was lured in with a “Buy Now, Pay Later” scheme without thinking through the details of interest rates, etc.

Since we manage her finances, we asked to see the bill so we could get it paid for her and balance her monthly budget. She charged nearly 500 dollars to this credit account. She also did not hand over the info until we asked and she already missed this month’s payment due date. Apparently they want her to pay 25 a month plus 25.99% interest for the next 17 months or so. Honestly, her budget is down to zero each month- she cannot even afford the 25 a month. 

I would imagine the bill goes to collections eventually if she doesn’t pay. (I am pretty clueless with this as I have never carried a balance on a card or anything like that) Can a collection agency garnish her social security?

She claims she did not provide her bank account/debit card info when applying for the credit but not sure what to believe- she will fib to us sometimes.

* Mid 20s, single w/ no dependents

* 120k salary (technically also have 12k bonus and 100k in RSUs vesting over next 4 years, but I haven't been at this company long enough to know how consistently this bonus will pay out in full, and the stock has historically not been a very strong performer so it could be next to nothing by the time it actually vests. Thus I'm not comfortable counting them when budgeting).

* I take home 2.5k biweekly after maxing 401k and HSA contributions.

* No major debts except monthly CC statement, which is generally somewhere between $1k-1.5k each month.

* Current rent is $2k and that's pretty comfortable I feel. I think I could realistically pay more like 2.5k for housing. Maaaaybe 3k? (but that might involve cutting down savings being put into markets, let me know if this is a terrible idea)

* Currently have about 100k in index funds, adding 1k biweekly so hoping it will be larger than that when it comes time to buy.

Last year I was employed in two remote roles, one was super chill so I picked up the second job. The second contract just ended so Ill be employed in one role to start the year and will probably pick up another in the next few months.

My current role pays 45/hour, W2 no benefits. I am planning on maxing an IRA at $6,500.  Won’t have any 401k match and I think I don’t even have access to contribute to a 401k because my employer doesn’t offer one.  I will live on this salary and when I pick up a second job I’ll bank all of that.

Worth noting that I am a us military vet with 100% disability, so I don’t pay anything for healthcare and I get a check every month from the VA for $3,600.

My question is more about what to do with the next job’s wages. I’ll probably pick up another 6-12 month contract this year and want to bank all of that (except taxes of course).

2971,personalfinance,"I'm new to investing, I've been doing so for roughly half a year. My goal is to invest in stocks that pay dividends and continuously re-invest those dividends back into more shares over the roughly 30 stocks I have shares in. I've created a strategy which I believe will let me increase my dividends slightly faster but I'd like to share here and confirm.

Every 2 weeks, I make my investments, combining a fixed amount from my paycheck with whatever dividends I've received in the previous 2 weeks. My strategy is to heavily favor buying shares in stocks where the ex-date will occur within the next 2 weeks. My reasoning is that I will see a slight return from that investment pretty soon in the form of dividends paid out by that stock within the next month or so. As I keep doing this, I'll be compounding dividends faster.

I believe this is valid because of this thought experiment: let's say I have 4 stocks which pay once per year. Each stock pays dividends in a different quarter: stock A for Q1 up to stock D for Q4. Each pays 4% dividend. I'll have $100 each quarter to invest.

* If I invest $100 in each quarter all into stock D, I'll have $400 in stock D and have a total value of $416.
* If I invest $100 in each stock at each quarter, I'll have:
   * $100 in A, which yields $4
   * $104 in B, which yields $4.16
   * $108.16 in C, which yields $4.3264 (I'm not sure how the rounding would actually work but here I'll use fractional cents)
   * $112.4864 in D, which yields $4.499456
   * At the end, I'll have a total value of $100 + $104 + $108.16 + $112.4864 + $4.499456 = $429.15

I will now be providing part-time/short-term speech services to public schools as a W9 employee - covering maternity leaves and LOAs, covering caseloads until they find a permanent SLP, etc.  The demand for this type of niche service is pretty big and I'm not too worried about getting gigs, except possibly during the summer - I guess we'll see how that pans out.  

(For reference, when I decided this was what I wanted to do i sent a mail merge to all the special ed directors in two counties.  I sent the email at 12:53 pm and by 1:10 pm was booked Monday through Thursday at two different school districts through the end of the school year.  I have a third district who might be interested in Fridays, but I was kind of hoping to keep Fridays free.)

Anyway, I've never done anything like ths before, and I'm afraid I'll screw up my finances.  I'd appreciate help/advice in making sure I have all my bases covered. 

I already have health coverage from my pension, so I don't need to worry about that. I also have professional liability insurance.

To start, my rates are $85/hour and so far both jobs are 7 hour days - so that's $595 per day, $2380 per week.  I think I need to save about 30% for taxes, right?  So that's saving about $715 and banking about $1665 per week?

For taxes, I think I have to pay estimated taxes, but I'm not sure exactly what/how to do that. When I used the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator, it asked if I have a ""job that regularly withholds federal income taxes from your paychecks.""  I said no because nothing is withheld from my check when I get paid, and the tool said that I can't use it.  :-(  It seems like it's only for W4 jobs?

When I do my tax returns, I can claim business expenses now, right?  For instance, I bought my own evaluation kits for $2100, so I can claim those on my tax return?  Can I claimm the laptop I bought this year if I am using it for work? (In the fall I contracted just one day per week at a school district and bought the laptop to use there.)

Finally, for taxes, is it based on when you did the work, or when you got the money?  Example:  I worked in December for $3600, but won't get paid for that until January.  That still goes on this year's taxes, right?

I also now have to consider that I only get paid on days that I work, so holidays and sick days will affect my paycheck.  I feel like I should set up my own PTO fund so that I don't panic if there's a snow day or if I'm sick.  How do I determine what is an appropriate amount - based off my last job it seems like $550/month is reasonable?

Should I open separate checking/savings accounts to deposit my paychecks in and buy materials/supplies from and then basically pay myself from those accounts, or is it fine to just use my existing personal accounts for everything?

I feel like there are probably tons of things I haven't thought of, or that I'm doing wrong.  Any advice is apprciated!

2984,personalfinance,"So I’m currently 17 years old, and I was recently accepted into a university early decision. I looked onto my college’s website, and I found out that my tuition will be about $80k a year (including housing + meals), and I assume my family will spend money to bring me home when school is out. I had several conversations with my mother about how exactly I will pay for school, and she said that the majority of my tuition will be payed through a trust fund that my father left me before he passed away.
For most of my life, I chose not to ask my mother about the trust because I always heard her complain about how the long court battle she had trying to uphold the clause of her divorce agreement saying that if either she or my dad were to pass away before I was 18, they would leave all their money to me, but my father instead tried to leave *some* money to his friends and establish his lawyer friend as my trustee. Apparently, the fight got pretty nasty, and even though my mother was named a trustee by a judge later on, my dad’s lawyer friend used money from my trust fund to pay for his defense in the lawsuit. My mom also objected to paying someone to manage my stocks and bonds while we have family who are very successful hedge fund workers.
After sitting down with my mom, I discovered that my trust fund is currently worth about $1.4 million in various stocks and bonds. The fund was set up about 3-4 years ago at around $1.1 million, and it has paid my $40-45k tuition at private school since then, and I guess it makes sense that its still gaining money if the annual return for this year was about 5.3% or $72k. I did see that the fund was worth about $1.8 million a year ago, but my hedge fund friend explained that some stocks have gone down in the past year, and they will for a bit in the future. The fund, however, is still where it was 2 years ago, and that’s after my mom took out $150-$200k to pay for expenses.
My real question is what should I expect the next “changes” to my trust to look like, because even though my mother told me it will dissolve and ownership will be mine at around age 23, the trust was set up entirely for EDUCATION. Based on the way my mom talked about it, she didn’t expect me to have much of anything left by the time I finish college (and possibly grad school) since my trust has fluctuated a bit. I still thought that if I can generate $72k a year from the trust, and combine it with the $30-40k from my Mom’s 529, I wouldn’t see much of a change compared to now, and I could have $1 million by the time I’m 23.

2995,personalfinance,"I have an long forgotten SERPS pension that I can access at 55. It's my only pension plan. It's currently worth 120K. I'd like to withdraw 25% tax free at 55 and then leave the rest invested to use when really needed. The pension provider says it a bad idea to do it at 55 even when they offer me the option to do it? I'm not sure if I trust them tbh.

I have an appointment with a financial advisor in the new year but I'm curious to run it by this sub. What do you think?",Withdrawing from a pension at 55,1672503931

So I guess I’m wondering what happens? As far as I understand there’s no way for me to cancel or turn in the bond.  Is there any option for me to recoup my money?  Thanks","I Bond in gift box, recipient deceased",1672503926
2997,personalfinance,"From what I've read, making a lump sum contribution to a Roth IRA is the slightly preferred method for hitting the yearly contribution limits. I can understand the reasoning behind this. The part that I don't get is where is that lump sum coming from? If it's money that has been collecting in a savings account throughout the year, why not just contribute it throughout the year? Aren't you missing some growth while you accrue enough funds?",lump sum roth ira payment,1672503841
2998,personalfinance,"Hello, I'm looking for a loan calculator with input variables of loan amount, monthly or biweekly payments, and interest rate. With the solved values being time it will take to pay off the loan and the amount of interest that will be paid. My goal is to see how changing my repayment amount impacts the long term amount of interest paid. Can anyone suggest a calculator, or perhaps provide an excel formula top do what I'm looking for? Any help is appreciated!

Thank you!","Looking for a specific loan calculator, would love suggestions!!",1672503786
2999,personalfinance,"I am trying to set up a system of spreadsheets to track our financial picture. The programs like Quicken that I've used in the past are overly complicated and require lots of maintenance. 

One thing that I can't find is a good template to track post-retirement spending which is set up for a family of two who are not in the same age bracket (my wife is almost a decade younger). 

Basically, I want to be able to plug our respective current ages, retirement ages, forecasted net worth / social security &amp; pension (and the years they kick in, which is not necessarily the same as retirement year)/ desired yearly income / projected inflation / projected investment performance, and  see what the different scenarios look like (e.g. ""what do we need to set aside to live into our 90s without drawing down the principal ?"")

Most of the templates I found are for a single person. I did find one that matches the scenario above but it's in British pounds and extremely complicated. 

I am using Numbers, but Excel will do as well.","Retirement planning template for dual earners, different ages ?",1672503704
