With the cost of living here (house, car payments, food, ...) - $150k before taxes a year is sadly not enough to pay our monthly bills.

My question: How do I ""tap"" the annual stock grant (once a year) and keep it available throughout the year? I'm not happy with putting that much money into a savings account (we already have a rainy day fund so a large sum is already not invested).

Do I simply put more into my savings and forget about missed opportunities on the stock market? (I'm a strong believer in ""time in the market beats timing the market"").

Are there better ways to place this additional money that we need access to? Would it be okay to tap the rainy day fund, keep the annual stocks in the stock market (index funds) and then refresh the rainy day fund each time the annual stock vests? 

I'm afraid if I'd be let go a day before the vest, my rainy day fund would be too low and I wouldn't be able to refresh it then.

25,personalfinance,"With the ability to automate so many processes and payments, it's easy to get lulled into comfort. The reality of it is that if there is a glitch in the system, you're both responsible for the fallout as well as be your own first responder. Hopefully you have the funds to deal with the fallout, and hopefully you get someone who cares about you when you call the agencies you're involved with.

For example, the app on which I pay my mortgage only allows me to enter an exact amount for monthly payment. But when escrow had gone up and increased my payment due, my payment was considered ""insufficient"" and thus voided altogether. I've just been abroad for several months and wouldn't have been easy to contact. What would have happened if this silliness happened while I've been gone?

Another example, I just got pulled over and was alarmed when the officer informed me that my insurance had been expired since last May. I call my insurance company and they don't know why my policy ended, and I see no email from them about expiration. I can't even log into the account since my policy had expired. Now I'm facing a hefty bill, my car almost got towed, and seems my license will be revoked when I go to court, after which I need to deal with getting my license back.

Married (27) with 2 young kids. We have maxed my 401k (with a 9% match) and both of our Roth IRAs for the last 3 years. Maxed Roth accounts, but no 401k the year before that. We currently have $115,000 in retirement savings and another $50,000 in a taxable account. We currently invest $3,500 a month into retirement accounts, including my company match. We still save an additional $1,500+ a month into taxable accounts on top of this. 

I was running numbers on a compound interest calculator today, and as it stands, if we continue investing $3500 a month into retirement accounts until 35 (8 years) we will have $726,000 in 401k and Roth accounts. This is assuming a 10% return non inflation adjusted. We are invested 100% in S&amp;P 500 ETFs, which have averaged 13% non inflation adjusted the last 10 years. 

We live in a low cost of living part of the country. We grew up here, have decent jobs and don’t plan to move. My thought is - would it be a viable financial plan to knock down contributions to just my company match at 35 and max Roth IRA, so we can allocate the rest of that money towards taxable investments, rental properties etc.? Contributing to company match and maxing Roth accounts alone still puts us at over $2,000 per month going to retirement accounts. 

If we assume the same 10% rate of return referenced above and the 726,000 figure is accurate, we could not put another dime in retirement and at 55 it would be compounded to almost 5 million.

39,personalfinance,"I've had sort of an interesting few years, and don't really have anyone I can look to in my life to ask advice, so thought I'd log back on here and try to crowdsource some myself.

So long story short, after coming out of college at 21, I was planning on joining a regular tech type of job being a BDR or maybe some sort of consulting/banking job. I graduated during covid and the job market seemed a bit weird, then there was this opportunity to help a friend launch a SAAS company during this time. I went for it, and ended up doing pretty well with it, making around $150k/yr during 2021/2022, but somehow not really saving any of it (lost some/spent a lot). 

Additionally, I got lucky with some investments and got my crypto portfolio up to around $3 million somewhere around the beginning of 2022. Since then I have called it quits on the whole crypto thing, and then the SaaS company fell off almost completely, with revenue dying out and the company disbanding. I've started to cash out a good amount of the portfolio am currently sitting in:

60% cash

20% equities 

15% t-bonds @ 4.8%

5% remaining crypto portfolio 


I do anticipate by the end of the year moving some more cash into equities/bonds but am also keeping it in there in the opportunity of purchasing a condo or something like that. 

the total post-tax combined amount of all this by the end of the year should sit around 1.5 million (in CA, not fun but it is what it is) 

0 debt, 0 real estate or any other assets

I've kept expenses quite low during all of this and am currently burning about $5,000 a month, which I would like to reduce because now I feel like I am starting to just burn for no reason. It boils down to 

rent - 2k

car + insurance - 1k 

food/misc - 2k


I've had sort of a mini-retirement over the past year and was seeing where the market would sit but over the past few months I've decided I do not want to work in that industry anymore. It feels weird not having much experience in a larger tech/finance company so I am not sure how the switch would really work, it also is going to be a bit different going from an average 7 figure total income down to 100k, if I can even get that, but I really need to get back to work and keep earning.

I would like to buy a house/condo within the next few years, and maybe even start a family. In CA the amount of money I have made does not seem sufficient enough to just stop working obviously. I think that I need to keep earning and growing a career. The 1.5 million start is a great point, but I really do not know where to go from here. 

The other option I have been thinking about is business school, but I am not sure if I would get into anything that would be worthwhile.

So I guess my overall following questions are 

-How are my investments? At what point am I able to start to look at purchasing a condo/townhouse in the $1-1.5 million range? 

-What career paths should I start to research in my free time and begin to apply to?

49,personalfinance,"Hello Folks

I am looking to prepare for taxes this year and has I had a few major life milestones. Want to make sure I am prepared properly. Was able to buy my wife and I's first home and my wife gave birth to my beautiful daughter as well.

I have two deduction related questions

The first is that I recently purchased a house as a first time home buyer and am debating if the itemized deduction has value for me. I am going through potential deductions and was looking at deductions for home improvement.

We bought the house last year and as it is a older home, we needed to have some electrical and plumbing work done. The electrical came out to about $6k and the final for the plumbing was about 12k I believe. The electrical was replacing the electrical panel and other wiring to bring it up to code. The plumbing was was a sewer clean out installed and having the sewer pipeline lined for structural stability cause the pipe was installed in the late 60s.

The second is that with my wife having medical expenses from the birth of my daughter these would also be deductions as well. Based on what I am reading anything we paid out of pocket while we were in the hospital, which was a emergency C-Section cause she was born 5 weeks early would count correct. In total that was another 6k in expenses.

These combined with deductions from mortgage related deductions would be quite a bit more than the regular standard deduction of $25k filing married jointly. Am I correct?",Would these be applicable for itemized deductions? (Federal US),1673552802

I currently have about $17k in liquid cash, another maybe 5k in watches I can sell relatively easily if I choose to do so. 

My current car is a rebuilt title 2013 g37x that has a couple issues that I could live with but I’ve put it on the market to see what happens, hoping to get 9-10k for it. My credit score whenever I buy would be good/excellent which will prob yield me a 7% rate or so.

If I buy the GV70 I think I’d put down 20-25k and finance the rest. Thought process for the large down payment is that I currently am trying to learn about the market/how to invest so I have nothing in the market.

57,personalfinance,"Hi,

Starting this fall, I will be pursuing my PhD for the next 5-6 years. I have a significant amount of money lying around, and I am trying to figure out the best way to invest it.  A rough summary of my accounts can be found below:

\- 18000 in Roth IRA (maxed contribution for 2021, 2022, and 2023) (3 fund portfolio 70% domestic, 20% international, 10% bonds)

\- 15000 in 401k through my job

\- 6000 in series i bonds

\- 20000 in a checking account (my emergency fund \~ 9 months of expenses)

\- 80000 in an account with a wealth management company (\~60000 of which is liquid, 20k in individual stocks)

The main problem I have is that I want to move my money out of the wealth management company due to fees, and I generally don't think its necessary.  However, I'm not sure what the best way to do so is. My thoughts were set aside \~40k to invest annually in my Roth IRA. Would it be better to just invest this money in a taxable account now and just contribute whatever I can from my stipend to my Roth over the next 6 years?

The 20k in individual stocks I was considering selling out right next year when my income is lower (\~33k a year for my stipend vs my current income of \~90k). I would like to put that money in a taxable brokerage account with vanguard and invest in mutual funds in a 3 fund strategy.  

The final 20k I want to leave at least for the next year until I decide whether I want a car for grad school. I currently have a car, but it is 22 years old, and I don't know how much time it has left. If I decide I want a car the entire time, I would leave that 20k as liquid until my current car dies whenever that may be.

Also, I plan to roll my 401k into my Roth Ira on a year where my income is low (so probably the year after I sell off the individual stocks)

I looked at my transaction history and saw that on Monday and Tuesday there were 5 transactions each day withdrawing 100$ from a set of ATMs in the city.

I immediately reported the card stolen, and called my bank to dispute the transactions. My card is not physically missing, so they must have spoofed the information somehow. I am not sure.

My question is: In a situation like this, is it typical for the bank to refund the money? Also, should I contact the police in that city with the information on what happened? I don't know if they care enough about this sort of thing to go checking ATM cameras or what have you.

She has about 500k currently, 450k is in a TIAA account that got split in the divorce.  She has 50k in two IRA’s at BOA (traditional and Roth) already invested in various funds.  This is primarily in regards to the 450k from Tiaa we are trying to get invested. 


We talked to chase advisors about an actively managed portfolio. Immediately after hearing the monthly fee (1.3% of portfolio, divided by 12)  we knew this is not for her.  She told them she wants a moderate “set it and forget it” portfolio,  so actively managed is not the route to take.  The advisor said they make around 20 trades a year ( that was his CONSERVATIVE estimate)


I would like to get this 450k rolled into the BOA IRA she has, and then set up the 3 fund “lazy” portfolio boglehead style. 

My question is - when the rollover occurs I understand she’s essentially getting a check from TIAA which will be given to BOA.  Then she should see the money move into her IRA


My main question is what is the smartest way to go about getting this cash invested?  Not specifically which funds, as I will use bogleheads references and compare expense ratios,  but should it be like $25-50k worth of purchases every week or so until  it’s fully invested?  

I can’t imagine taking the 450k and immediately splitting it amongst 3 funds on day 1 makes the most sense , from a dollar cost average standpoint.

I recently had to rent a car while mine was in the shop under repair following an accident. The at-fault insurance authorized a mid-size rental capped at roughly $26/day, but when I got to the rental center (specifically one of the big name companies with the green E in their logo) they had no midsize vehicles available for use that day.

The next class they had was pickup trucks and, not being able to go without a car due to work, I opted for it. I was charged the difference for the ""upgrade"", and paid it without much of a second thought along with my damage deposit. A few days later I was able to return the truck and switch into a midsize vehicle, and all was good.

However, in talking with the at-fault insurance, I mentioned that they had no midsize vehicles available on the first day of the rental period and that I had been charged the difference. I asked if there was any way I could be reimbursed for that, and they told me that it's industry standard for the rental company themselves not to charge the upgrade difference if no vehicles are available in the insurance-authorized size/price class.

Is this correct? I would love to be able to recoup the difference but don't want to sound like an idiot if I speak with anyone with the rental company. TYIA!",Car rental upgrade refund due to lack of availability?,1673541024

Sorry for the long post but I feel is necessary to explain the situation. Basically, my fiance and I are getting married in September of 2023 and we have begun to book certain vendors. We opened a new chase credit card to take advantage of the expenses and rack up points. We booked a big photography company which basically contracts photographers for the day of the wedding. While we were shortening our picks, this particular company was very responsive and always got back to us in quick fashion. Eventually we decided to book them and they demanded 50% of the total cost (should have been the first red flag) for the package which turned out to be around $1800. We paid it on December 20 of 2022.

The problems began immediately after booking with them. They are now very unresponsive and we have yet to even be able to schedule our initial phone call meeting which layouts our plans for the wedding. Every email takes about a week to respond and their only excuse is that they are super busy right now. We text and call the company and can hardly ever get through anyone. Now my fiance and I are extremely worried that if this persist until our wedding day than we might be stuck with a terrible company and will not be satisfied with the photos and videos.

My fiance brought up the idea of seeing if we can get a refund but their website states that the original deposit is non-refundable. Since we think the company would not want to issue a refund we are thinking of doing a charge back but are scared of how the company might retaliate. Up to this point they have not provided us with any service or product. We have spoken with Chase and they said they can initiate the charge back if we want to go ahead with it.

* 60k in personal portfolio

Basically the concept of using your money wisely, but it can also apply to other things like time or your own personal energy levels.

It would be stupid to spend $1000 on canned beans for the next 5 years just because they’re on sale (unless you‘re a prepper haha), you’d be better off buying just a few and then taking the rest of that money and using it towards your rent or if you’ve got a business investing in some equipment.

Now this sounds a lot like “opportunity cost,” but to me that just describes what you’re missing out on when you buy one thing instead of another.

What I’ve been interested in lately is the idea of how **the way you use your money** can impact how much buying power it has over the long run.

Maybe similar to the way a new company would “bootstrap” everything together just so they can become profitable. Figuring out a way, even with just the bare essentials, to make things work.

This can be especially helpful for the young adults or teenagers out there who don’t have a lot of money right now because there are ways **you can maximize your moneys power by utilizing in it a specific way, also in a specific order.**

If you had $10,000 you could easily blow through it in one day, or for some people they could manipulate it and allocate it in such a way to turn that money into a million dollar company.

179,personalfinance,"Hey everyone. I am going to lay out my financials and goals, please let me know what opinions/suggestions you all have. Here’s my background:

-27yo Male

-Living in Brooklyn NY (still living home)

-Total gross income 2022: $138,292 (2 jobs) and I expect to make the same, if not more this year. 

-Current Bills:
     375/mo car
     200/mo car insurance
     150/mo gas
     100/mo in tolls
     500/mo rent to parents
     42/mo phone
     70/mo gym, uber one

Current Investments/cash:
All of my money is broken down as follows:
50% - Vanguard Mutual fund
30% - Individual stocks (half blue chip, half riskier investments such as EV)
10% - Crypto (mostly BTC and ETH)
10% - Cash (mostly in an online high yield savings acct)
   
Debt:
My families home that I currently live in is 100% in my name only, as well as the line of credit we took out on the home to redo the back yard. Balances are as follows:

Fixed rate mortgage at 2.9%
Balance is 117k, monthly payment is 1,038/mo including taxes and insurance. Value of the home is around 550k. 

0 student loans or credit card debt

My car is a lease. 

The line of credit we took out was for $100k, but we have only pulled 30k out of it. The rate we signed was variable: currently at 8%. The monkey payment on that is about $200/ month. 

Again, both of these loans are completely under my name, with no co-signer, although I do not actually make the payments myself. The only payments I make is the $500/ mo directly to my parents. They send me the money for the mortgage and line of credit monthly. 

My end goal is to buy myself a condo.  As of this moment all my investments / cash is worth around $85k. Keeping in mind this time last year it was worth around $140k. Yes 2022 was a painful year. Overall I’m about even / up a little on my investments.

224,personalfinance,"Saw another post here recently mentioning the benefits of Roth IRA over Roth 401(k), specifically the no penalty on withdrawals. My understanding is that any *contributions* to the Roth IRA can be made at any time without penalty, but any *gains* must wait five years after account opening (or first contribution) to be withdrawn penalty free.

So my situation is this: I have about $5400 current balance in my Roth 401(k). Because of the stock market performance over the past year, my gains are only about $100 more than my total contributions to the account ($5300 or so). Because of the flexibility afforded to withdrawals from Roth IRAs, I am considering transferring this balance into a Roth IRA in the event of an emergency in the near future (I don't currently have an emergency fund though I intend to build one up this year to cover). If I were to transfer, it would be into a new IRA, so the five year clock would start then and there.

Question: If transferred today, would the total $5400 be considered one big contribution to the IRA? Or would my current 401(k) account manager notate somehow to the IRA account manager how much of that lump contribution is comprised of gains? Obviously if I absolutely had to make a withdrawal I would only do so with the contribution portion so as to avoid any penalties.

244,personalfinance,"Two years ago, I bought a used 2015 VW GTI Autobahn with around 70k miles. Last week, I had to take it to a mechanic because of an issue with the engine. The shop is well known in the area and is pretty reputable. Anyway, they told me that the engine needs to be replaced.

Obviously there is no warranty on the car. So the total cost of repair will be around 7-10k, depending on the mileage on the swapped engine (engines are usually from scrapyards, used parts stores, etc). For example, engines with 80k+ miles will go for around 3-4k while low mileage ones will go for 5k+. The cost of the labor is 4.5k before tax assuming there are no other complications. 

Sadly, this engine failure has come up after only two years with a total of 10k miles driven. But, given my light usage, I think I can get by without a car since I work remotely and can use public city transportation if needed. Finally, there is around 10k left on my car loan.

I have thought out a couple options

1. Fix and keep the car. There is some unknowable amount of risk from a used engine and possibly other parts failing. 
2. Fix and sell the car in the near future. Kelly blue book valued my car at 11-14k for a private sale. Probably less if I sold it to a dealership. I would try to keep repair costs close to 7-8k if I decide to do this.
3. Sell my car for scrap. I've seen people on marketplace and Craigslist selling totaled cars for a 1-2k.
4. Donate car. Nonprofit will try to sell my damaged car and I can deduct some amount from the sale from my income. 

I'm leaning toward donating my car. Fixing and selling sounded good to me at first, but there's a bit of risk of not making up the total repair cost, i.e I suspect the total repair cost will be closer to 8-9k even for a lower cost engine. Option 3 sounds too much of a hassle to make it worth it for me. Furthermore, if I decide to fix the car, I think I'd convince myself to keep it.

It sucks that I'd have to donate after such a short time of owning it. This is my first car, and it is in otherwise great condition. Not having a car would make it difficult for me to take my dog to the park, go hiking/skiing/etc., and get around the city freely. But I think that has to be the right choice?

Keep living this way. Use the money to continue paying half education and rent expense. Do this until my income is reliable enough to stop using that money and then put the rest away. 

Or, stop living this way. Lock it all up (ETFs probably, right?) for retirement and cut my expenses drastically. Lower happiness factor but higher security factor.

I was told to show up for an interview at the company and I did. I had no idea what the job requirements were. I didn’t know what job I was interviewing for! 

I asked for 45k and they gave it to me. Turns out that is what they give to everyone in this entry level position. But, even adjusting for inflation, I’m making more now than I was using my bachelors degree (I was an elementary school teacher).

They hired ten people, including myself. We are on two teams of 5. I am the only one who actually has all the qualifications in the job description (previous experience in an office, bachelors degree etc). I had also passed the test for my insurance license before being hired. Everyone else was paid for three weeks to study and their test and licensing fees were paid by the company.  

Im 32 and the oldest on my team. I’m the only one with a BA and applicable past work experience. 

I’m doing all my work and often have time to handle priority tasks for others on my team. I’ve offered to assist on urgent matters but last week I was asked to work on back logged low priority tasks for two other team members in addition to my regular accounts. This has been added to my daily duties.

I am an engineer with a lot of practical experience so I do most house projects myself, I do recognize my limits.

* Location: ""Medium"" cost of living in the Midwest
* Net worth \~$365K 
* Monthly Net $6200
* Traditional 401(k) Me: 11% employer match up-to 6% 1: .50, Roth 4%, Wife: 401(k) 12%, not sure about employer match off the top of my head.
   * Current balance for me $121K (Last year took a big hit), also only seven years in the workforce due to grad school.
   * Unsure of wife's balance, I would guess \~$35K-40K (I know I should ask, but she is flakey talking about it, has had few different employers, and she doesn't have the accounts consolidated yet, one of the goals for 2023): 5 years in the workforce.
* Normal Brokerage account: $80K, had been contributing $1500/month until the wife was laid off, plan to restart at $1000/month as our traditional 401(k) contributions are going to be stepping up.
* Checking: $5K, we try not to keep a lot sitting here
* Credit Union savings with my employer credit union: $2k, I contribute $150 each paycheck, this our short-term goal money. We used a lot of it for a trip to the UK last year.
* Emergency fund: $40K (this is skewed): it is actually $20K the other $20K is from a student loan refund as we paid it off before the Government Forgiveness attempt. We are cautiously hopeful but have it earmarked in case it doesn't happen.
* HSA: $14k; we are maxing this every year, just started 2 years ago from a PPO plan
* Pension: I, fortunately, have a cash balance pension with my employer; current estimates show it to be worth \~$600K at my retirement. When we talk with out Financial advisor, we do not include this as I do not want to bank on it.
* Retirement: We are both okay with working until 65; we enjoy what we do enough, the pay and benefits are good, and we get enough PTO to take the trips we want to take. 
* Mandatory Expenses:
   * Mortgage/taxes/insurance: $1500 required, we pay $925 biweekly = \~$2000/month over 26 payments a year. I plan to increase every year by $25, achieving a payoff date of March 2032, I can confirm all the extra goes to the principal. If I hold at $925 biweekly, the payoff date is October 2033 and saves $22K in interest compared to conventional monthly payments. $750 biweekly saves $11k in interest over the course of the loan with a maturity date of Oct 2037. 
      * Mortgage Details: Balance: $176K owed @ 2.75% 
   * Utilities, Cellphone, Car Insurance (2 cars): \~$650
   * No vehicle debt
   * No CC debt
   * Monthly Spending for Food, gas, groceries, going out, small projects, and ""stuff"" typically comes to $2K a month for the two of us. Are we spending too much here? We like to have fun but I don't think we are frivolous, maybe we are. How much could we realistically reduce this by?

281,personalfinance,"I recently switched jobs to a new employer. Both my previous employer and my current employer are EU-based Big Pharma companies. My previous employer offered a cash balance pension plan, in additional to the usual 401(k) retirement benefit. A cash balance pension is a defined-contribution pension plan (as opposed to ""traditional"" pensions which are defined-benefit)

I've already done a rollover of the 401(k) from previous employer to a Vanguard rollover IRA that I use as the landing spot for my 401(k) whenever I leave a job. That rollover IRA only contains pre-tax dollars; I have a separate Roth IRA with after-tax contributions.

That leaves the Cash Balance Pension plan - the current balance is \~$45K, and if I leave it in place it will continue to grow at a rate equivalent to the 24-month average of 30-year Treasury Bonds (currently \~3.6% i think?) until I reach retirement age at which point it converts to an annuity. there are a bunch of different annuity options about which I won't go into in detail here based on how I want to structure the annuity benefit for myself and my wife as my survivor.

From reading the plan docs I believe I can do a direct lump sum rollover of this balance into my rollover IRA without paying any tax on the money. My initial thinking is that it make sense to do this, because I can expect to beat the pension growth rate over time with a fairly straightforward index ETF based investing approach. I'm just not sure if the math pencils out once you factor in the annuity conversion - I think it does but want to be sure I'm not missing something obvious.

Some context:  


* I'm 45-years-old, married with 2 kids
* My investment philosophy is mostly Bogle-ish except I don't park any money in bonds - so i'm typically 80/20 US / International broad market index ETFs. This applies to my retirement accounts and my personal brokerage account
* Salary in the mid-200's, total comp in the high-300's factoring annual bonus + share grants. max my 401(k) contributions every year and park the rest of my savings in a personal brokerage account (plus the kids' 529's)

on top of everything else, that cash balance pension is parked with some random benefits administrator company (Alight?) which I have no other reason to have a continuing relationship with - and I just don't like the idea of having to keep track of that website/account for the next 25 years until i'm ready to cash out. by contrast my current (new) employer uses Fidelity to manage its 401(k) plan. I know it's trivial compared to the dollars and cents, but assuming the math works out this would be one more reason to move the money over to my Vanguard rollover IRA.

282,personalfinance,"A buddy of mine from years ago reached out about a new financial service he provides at his firm - permanent life insurance. He is trying to sell me on it as a sort of “hidden” retirement savings account. I’m skeptical about the merits of the whole thing. 

Basically, the way he described it, I should reduce my (generous) 401k match and contribute the difference to this PLI policy. From what he said, the policy works like an investment - and it’s different from a 401k in the sense that I could tap into it really whenever I needed it without paying the 401k early withdrawal penalties. From what I gather, this is partially true - but his trying to sell it as some sort of tax-haven savings account really rubbed me wrong. 

My company offers an insanely good 401k. I don’t remember the numbers off hand, but it’s 100% match up to (I think) 5% and 75% up to 5% of my salary thereafter). I contribute the max. I’m fully vested. He reviewed my pay stubs and was trying to tell me that I would come out ahead cutting my 401k contributions and sending the rest to PLI. His rationale centered around the (supposed) fact that I could pull from the PLI easier and cheaper than my 401k.

* A's stake is 2000 USD (20%)
* B's stake is 4800 USD (48%)
* C's stake is 3200 USD (32%)

In a certain month, they need to rent a cloud server for 3900 USD. After paying, the fund has 6100 USD left.

There are two possible methods for splitting expenses:

# 1. Ratio method

An expense is split by **ratio of each member's stake**.

For example, in this case, stake of each member is deducted as follow:

* A: $3900 x 20% = $780. His remaining stake is 1220 USD.
* B: $3900 x 48% = $1872. His remaining stake is 2928 USD.
* C: $3900 x 32% = $1248. His remaining stake is 1952 USD.

In the end, the ratio of stake between 3 members is still the *same*.

# 2. Equal division method

An expense is divided by the **number of contributing members**. Each equal part will be deducted from each member's stake.

In the example above, the cost is 3900 USD and there are 3 members, so it will be divided into 3 parts of 1300 USD each.

Remaining stake and ratio between them and total fund are derived as follow:

* A: $2000 - $1300 = 700 USD (11,5%)
* B: $4800 - $1300 = 3500 USD (57,4%)
* C: $3200 - $1300 = 1900 USD (31,1%)

Then I thought it was because my apartment rent was too high, so I moved to a cheaper apartment that is less than 30% of my monthly income because I heard that is what they go off of, but I was denied pre-approval again because of high DTI.

The apartment is $590/month per room, has a wide variety of amenities, and the school’s bus comes so I won’t have to spend much money on gas and parking passes. The dorm I’m in now, I’m living alone, but I dislike how I have little freedom and I have to use communal showers. The cost of the dorm is sorta similar to living in the apartment except I’m paying for 8-10 months out of the year for a dorm and with the apartment I’m paying the same for 12 months and will not be forced to move out because of the end of the semester. I plan on staying in my college town and working at the hospital here after college because it pays more here than in my small hometown, I do not want to live with my parents because of personal issues, and I might be graduating early in 2025. These factors are what brought my decision. My family is dirt poor, so I do get a generous amount in financial aid and loans. About $9k a semester. I still had to pay $500 per semester out of pocket because apparently I’m not need based enough. My mom doesn’t agree with the apartment decision and thinks I can’t keep up with the rent which is making me question my own decision and is making the decision sort of scary, but I have to grow up some time.

My questions are:

First, is it still better to pay for the car in cash to avoid any outstanding debts in case we do want to buy a home this year? I assume that would make it easier to secure a new home loan?

 My wife and I just got married a few weeks ago, and things are really starting to pile up. It is getting to the extent that we don't know how to budget it anymore. To name a few things that have happened in the last month:

* We are $1000 in debt from our wedding. We had a very small budget wedding. I am not sure it cost more than $2k or $3k. My wife is foreign so a decent amount of that money was tickets for her parents etc.
* We currently share a car (Prius) and found out that the wheel bearing needs to be replaced. We are driving this car into the ground and it just reached 250k miles. We might be replacing it if there are more problems that might show up. 
* We have about $1k coming up for legal fees for her marriage.

The silver lining is we have $8k coming towards us from my wife's savings, but we really need some of that for a down payment on a new car (we might have to buy two).

To be honest, I've always been pretty impulsive with my credit card spending (not an excuse but if it helps as a reason I was diagnosed with adhd  a couple years ago and my spending was horrendous and almost nonstop before medication and therapy), but I always paid my bills on time and never maxed my cards out. A few months ago, my car (a 2010 Mazda if needed) had the check engine light come and and it was close to $1000 to fix everything, then a few days later, my older dog was having accidents inside, and took her to the vet, she was diagnosed with diabetes and that appointment was $300 and her insulin is about $60 for the smallest of vials and it's $105 for the medicated food she needs. A couple weeks later is was about another $200 for the vet to do a glucose curve, and then it was $300 for more repairs on my car to pass inspection.

I didn't have a lot of savings, but used so much of it, I only have $12 left. I maxed out my cards either to pay for gas, groceries, or another vial of insulin after not planning and anticipating when I'd need a new one. Was late on paying some cards a few times and my bank account has been negative more than once these past few months.

I will be making $150,000 at this new job and was wondering how to allocate money between retirement accounts.

I know I should definitely contribute enough to the 401k to get the maximum employer match, but what breakdown of traditional vs. Roth 401k should I go for?

Also, since HSA has triple-tax benefits, should I contribute just enough to get the full 401k match and then try to max out my HSA contribution? My employer also has a small HSA match that gets triggered if I contribute any amount to the HSA. 

My intuition tells me that I should split my 401k contribution between traditional and Roth to get the full employer match, then to max out the HSA. After that, I should continue to split any leftover capital between the two 401ks. Thoughts on this plan or any things that I am overlooking?

Unbeknownst to me, the car had recently had an engine replacement (shop wasn't an authorized shop voiding dealer warranty and used an ebay engine they won't cover since I wasn't the owner at that time) . The car only had roughly 22k miles on it. The listing price of the car was 38k, and I financed 33k after down payment and trade. Car was sold as is no warranty so I purchased an optional dealer warranty. Long story short, after owning the car for 23 days, the engine failed (cracked block). The failure caused oil to dump on the exhaust, which in turn caused an engine bay fire. I've spent the last couple of months attempting to get somebody to cover the repairs between warranty and insurance. Insurance reluctantly agreed to only cover $1200 of the total repair cost ($13,300). After having the car towed everywhere, I'm ready to throw in the towel. I've been borrowing a car to drive, which is inconvenient. It would take me a little over a year to save the money to repair the car. I'm at the point where I'm ready to call the bank and return the car as a voluntary repossession. I feel this would allow me to negotiate a much lower payment on the remaining balance after auction. Without my current payment ($675/month) I feel I would be able to recover much quicker even if I had to buy a car for just a couple grand to start. I'm not worried about the credit impact because I have made the decision that I am DONE borrowing money. If I can't buy it cash I don't need it (except my house). Is this rational or reckless?

Would love your thoughts below on what I have learned so far. Please correct me on anything thats wrong. Please also let me know of other things that I should do research into to learn! thank you!

1. growth focused mutual funds/index funds/ETF: managed funds in specific sectors or stocks focused on stock growth. Best in a bullshit market with decreased risk due to diversification. Things to consider are specific focus of funds, expense ratio (cost), and past performance. gold standard here is S&amp;P500 index fund (go to index fund, high performance, low expense ratio)

2. Dividend focused mutual funds/index funds/ETF: managed funds specifically focused on dividends growth and reinvestment along with stock growth. Steady growth that is more resistant to bear markets as dividends can offset some of the decrease in stock performance. Specific things to look for are stock dividends focused vs. stock growth focused, expense ratio, past performance. the gold standard here is SCHD (proven record, large diversification, yields on growth and dividend)

3. Treasury bonds/I bonds: money loaned to the government and other entities with a promise of return after a certain time period. This is a very safe investment that is a cash equivalent that protects your money from inflation while keeping it liquid. It has the lowest grow rate out of most types of investing but makes up for it in liquidity and safety. If you need money for upcoming large purchases, you want to invest in bonds for quick liquidation and safety. gold standard is US treasury bond (backed by us government, 4.8% interest on 26 weeks bond, can sell early if necessary for liquidity)",rate my understanding for types of investing,1673478881

393,personalfinance,"Hello, 

My (23m) car got totaled in an accident and my insurance is giving me a statement that will allow me to pocket about 3k for a new car. 

My parents recommend that I finance a newer model vehicle because it's more reliable (I will be driving quite a bit in the next few months) and to build my credit which I have less than 5 years of history with. 

My sister recommends me to purchase a vehicle to save money in the long run and to not worry about making payments. 

Now, I'm in a huge transition point in my life. I got a new job making double what I made before, but it's pretty much out-of-state from my parents and any real support system. Financially, I think I'll be stable, but I also don't have an apartment yet (I'm getting that set up as I type) and I don't have much financial support from my family to go off of.

394,personalfinance,"Notice all of the quotations. 

I just graduated with a PhD in mathematics and got my first big girl job in San Diego. I went to school in Mississippi and used Sallie Mae as a way to get through school while only having to work 1 job (although sometimes 2 when I had the time). When I say I used Sallie Mae… I mean I would take out a couple thousand dollars more in student loans than needed to also help out with rent and bills. I’m sure I’m not the first to do this, but I obviously regret it now. At the same time, there’s no way I would’ve been able to work 2-3 jobs while in school for 7 years pursuing a doctorate. I mean.. I guess I could’ve.. but no. 

Anyways, by the time graduation rolled around, I had two credit cards on top of my $50k in student loans (MS is cheeeaaap). One credit card is one I’ve had since I was 16 and I got it for myself to use for gas money. Obviously it’s been used for other things since then lol. The other card is one a financial professional at my bank signed me up for to use the 0% APR promo to pay off as much of my student loans as I could in a year. About two months after having this new credit card, my kitty cat, my SON, was hospitalized for 2 nights with a urinary blockage. A couple weeks later I found out I got the job in San Diego (I was living in New Orleans at the time) and needed to relocate.  My company helped out a little bit, but needless to say, I now had two maxed out credit cards. I did a balance transfer from my original card to another 0% APR card, and now I’m looking at 2 maxed out credit cards and 1 about 75% paid off (the LOC on the new promo card was less than the balance on my original card). But, for now, I’m only paying interest on one card, and the one with the smallest balance. 

I’m spending about $1200 a month trying to pay off these cards before the promos end. Plus $540 a month on my student loans. I’m also adjusting to living in one of the most expensive cities in America with about $1000 a month leftover for groceries, gas, and my “wants”. Totally doable, fine. Now for the part that will make you cringe:

A friend of mine is a “credit repair specialist” - his dad is too so it’s a family thing I guess. Now keep in mind, my credit score isn’t terrible (roughly 650 due to utilization), and I have no delinquencies. He suggested I STOP paying off my card(s), LET my credit card(s) go delinquent, and then dispute to the collectors that the debts aren’t mine. He’s POSITIVE that he could get a card or two off my report completely within a year. Well, we got into a huge argument and he told me that I just don’t understand how debt collections work. Now, I’m not letting anyone play The Sims on my credit report, but this cannot be a thing that people do, right? It sounds absolutely ass-backwards to me for a CREDIT REPAIR SPECIALIST to suggest going delinquent on purpose… any one ever heard of this “strategy” before? Or is it just called scummy fraud?

Also, guess who needs all new tires after that hell of a drive! I guess I’ll be staying on that “college diet” haha WHY IS CALIFORNIA SO EXPENSIVE

Two weeks later I returned the device and cancelled the data plan. I was told by the Verizon store employee everything was 100% taken care of and I owed nothing.

Three years later and I pull my credit to find Verizon was claiming I owed them $54 for this service. I called Verizon customer support, explained the situation, and they assured me it was their mistake. They took the claim off my credit and I was told everything was 100% cancelled.

This is where I messed up: I didn't get any of this in writing. Only verbally over the phone (and in-store before).

I got hit with multiple medical bills that I am trying to figure out if I should pay out of pocket or use my HSA. I have a fully funded emergency fund, my employer contributes $4,000/year into my HSA (paid quarterly), I contribute an additional $2,000/year, and I make enough money to pay for the medical bills out of pocket.

* VXUS would be in a taxable account for possible foreign tax credit

I have an IRA that I've been contributing to for a few years (it's not a significant portion of my retirement savings though).  The problem is that for those years I've not been able to reclaim the taxes for the money I put into it because I've been above the max income level to get the tax deduction.

I've since created a Roth IRA and started putting the money there instead so that I'm not making the issue worse, but I still have a good chunk of money from several years of maxing out the traditional IRA that I need to roll into the roth IRA.  My problem is that when I report on rolling over to the roth IRA it's going to want to make me pay taxes on the amounts, but that doesn't make sense because I never got the tax discounts in the first place.

1. Is there any guidance anyone here can give on how to navigate the tax forms (I use turbotax but would use a different app or do it manually if needed...though manual would be painful) so that I can file my taxes correctly to note the rollover without incurring duplicate taxes?

421,personalfinance,"My wife and I have outgrown our starter house and we've started the process of looking to build our forever house. We're excited to take the next step, but I'm not sure if the timing is in our favor, so I'm hoping to get an outside opinion on our situation. Here's what we're working with...

We bought our starter home in 2016 for $285k and the current value is $385k.
Current mortgage is a 30-year fixed at 3.5% (refinanced in 2020).
Current mortgage balance is approximately $225k.
Only other outstanding debt is a car payment and a debt consolidation loan, totaling $1325/month.
We have $45,000 in a savings account.
Our combined salary is $220k/year.
We've spoken with a builder in our area and were told to plan spending approximately $300/sqft based on the level of finishes we want.
Our budget for the next house is $900k (including the lot).

So my question about the timing involves the current housing market. We have some decent equity in our current home, but a new mortgage means a new (higher) mortgage rate. Property where we want to build (northern NJ) has started to slip a little, but still pretty pricey. If we wait for the cost of land and/or building materials to drop, we then run the risk of our current equity dropping, too.

437,personalfinance,"TL;DR: Happy with my job, not my pay. Expressed my salary concerns to my boss, and I'm currently slated for a 12% raise next month. Got an offer for almost 30% more with another company, but benefits are worse and cost of living is higher. What would you do next?

Okay, I'll try to cover everything. I am a scientific professional in the civil engineering consulting industry. I was unhappy with my annual raise in 2022, so I set out to see if I could get paid more somewhere else, or at least get an offer that would give me some leverage to get a larger raise in my current position this year. I've received and offer and am hoping to get some advice on my situation.

I currently work in Cincinnati. I was hired two years ago in 2021 for an entry-level level field-based position with an engineering consulting company at an annual salary of $56,000 USD. I went into my current position with about a year of combined experience in the form of an internship that I did before grad school and a consulting job that I landed after finishing my Masters degree. I was laid off from that consulting job in 2020 and ended up working in a grocery store for about another year. The entry-level position I was hired for in 2021 did not require a Masters degree at all, and since I had been working in retail and struggling to find work, I pounced on the offer, even though $56k wasn't a lot.

I excelled in my job and quickly became viewed as a reliably key contributor on my team. I was slightly overqualified compared to a typical worker in that role, and combined with the year of experience I already had, I rapidly began to take on responsibilities beyond what was typical for an entry-level employee on the team, but still wholly within the scope of an individual contributor. In Spring of 2022, at the end of my first annual review cycle, I received a promotion from a Level 1 to Level 2 staff member. This is the level into which early career professionals are typically hired who are a bit beyond being considered entry-level, but are not typically being assigned any direct reports or given the responsibility of managing a team. Along with my promotion I received a ~7% raise, and I had to fight for it. Initially they offered ~5.5%. The raise I received brought my salary up to almost exactly $60,000 USD annually. Typically annual raises at my company for employees who are performing but not receiving a promotion are 3%. At the time, the 12-month inflation rate was right above about 8%. I wasn't happy. I resolved to try to find a better paying job, or to at least get something in writing that I could use for my next annual review cycle to try to leverage a larger raise than I expected they would give me otherwise.

In late 2022, I called a meeting with my boss and my branch manager. I expressed to them that I was unhappy with the raise I received earlier that year. I explained how I expect my salary to increase at a rate that outpaces inflation, and the fact that I didn't obtain that even with receiving a promotion was a red flag for me, that I considered it a step backwards, and that I wasn't okay with that. I stated very clearly that I was very worried about taking another step backwards with my annual raise in Spring 2023 since inflation rates were still in the 6% to 7% range, and that if that was the case, I'd be worried that I would no longer be able to afford to work with them.

At the time, I'd been interviewing with another company who was attempting to recruit me after I'd been referred to them by an third party. They were interested in me moving to a very high cost of living city on the east coast. I told them I'd be very interested if their offer made financial sense. That was mostly a lie. I felt like I would hate working with the branch manager I had interviewed with. Nevertheless, I made it seem like I was very interested so that they would give me something in writing, and it seemed likely they would make me an offer, which is one of the reasons I decided to have a meeting to express my salary concerns to my superiors. Ironically, they gave me written offer the same day I had that meeting, just a few hours later in the day.

Their offer was about 22% higher than my $60k salary. Their wasn't nearly enough to justify moving, especially since they are a smaller company and their benefits package is significantly less valuable that my current employer's. They had asked how much I wanted, and I evaded the question by basically telling them I wasn't sure how much it would take to make it worth it, just that I expected something commensurate with the responsibilities of the role and that reflected the cost of living difference between the two cities. As a follow up, they asked me how much my current salary was. I told them, but I inflated it by ~20%.

As a result, their offer represented an incredibly marginal increase to what they thought I was already making. I wasn't excited at all. I responded to their offer letting them know that unfortunately it didn't make financial sense, but that I'd be willing to consider further offers if they had room in their budget in order to reflect the increased cost of living. I reminded them that I currently liked my job and was in overall positive work environment (which was true) in an attempt to imply to them that they needed to make it worth my while.

They responded by increasing their offer to a salary that equates to a ~27% raise from my current salary, so just a few thousand dollars more annually. More important, they offered me a choice of moving to Atlanta instead. Atlanta seems to be still more expensive than Cincinnati, but not nearly as much as the alternative. I told them I wanted to meet the folks in Atlanta. That process in ongoing. So far, I like them way better than the first office. I told my boss I wanted to continue my salary discussions from last year. I told him I'd received an offer in writing from another company for a significant pay raise, and I wanted to know what sort of raise I could expect at the conclusion of the review cycle in Spring 2023. He told me they had me down for a 12% raise. I have not yet asked for that in writing, but in the event I turn down my prospective employer, I plan to request their promised raise in writing before rejecting the offer on the table. I told him 12% was more than I feared I would get, but that the number I was really looking for was 16% to 18%.

So my choice is between ~$67,000 annually in Cincinnati (assuming their 12% is true) and ~$76,000 annually in Atlanta. Here's the catch. The benefits where I'm at are better. I get fluctuating work week (Chinese) overtime at my current job, but no overtime at the new job. Retirement match is currently 4% compared to 3% at the new job. Per Diem rates are ~20% higher at the current job. Healthcare costs are significantly less at my current job. I currently get almost $1000 / year extra to pay for my cell phone because I use it for work.

The biggest difference, though, is that I currently am able to commute in a company vehicle. My wife and I share one car. I've been given implicit permission to commute in my field vehicle. If not for this, I'd have to buy a car and insure it. They even pay for the gas I put in it to commute. This was not an explicit part of the job offer, though. My wife was rear-ended during my first year with this company, and the car was totaled. When I was discussing the logistical problems I was having in before replacing her car, two of my supervisors independently suggested commuting in the company car I routinely use. Neither specified whether this was intended to be a short-term or long-term solution, but for about a year now I've been doing this. Nobody has expressed any concern. It's been great.

I just found out there's no guarantee this will continue. My division has ~20 employees companywide, but I was only one of two in my local office when I was hired, so I was basically working on a two-man team day-to-day. Our team had two vehicles, so we each had our own. We just hired a third team member, and at the same time one of our division's vehicles is being re-appropriated to another team in a different office. This will leave one vehicle for three team members. We will have the option to borrow vehicles from other divisions that operate in our branch, though, and there are plenty of those. While I'll likely be able to commute regularly for the next month or two, later in the year when the new teammate gets up to speed, it seems like the this gravy train may very well come to an end.

So that's where I'm at. Currently my plan is to counter-offer my prospective employer with a salary that would make it actually worth considering. Ideally, I'd like to give them a number that they aren't able to actually meet, but close enough that they increase their current offer, then take their new offer to my current employer to see if they are willing to increase my 12% raise. I'm worried that the actual number that would make me want to leave is just too high and was result in them digging in their heels, but at the same time I don't want to burn bridges by giving them a number that isn't actually quite good enough for me to accept, have them agree, then reject the offer.

459,personalfinance,"Hi r/personalfinance,

My wife and I got married in April 2022. With the wedding, honeymoon, moving states (to Ohio - a non community property state) and unexpected medical bills, we got into about $20,000 worth of credit card debt. The credit card is only in my name as she is not on the card. This is all debt we accrued together though, not just me. I paid it off every month until wedding season hit and we used this card in particular aspirin other two cards max out at $1,500 and we don’t really use them.

She had a trust set up by a family member and we have added to it together since before we were married. We are trying to buy a house soon and want this debt cleared so we sold shares from her account that is now sitting in her bank account.

We will be filing jointly and we are in the process of adding me to that account. We also understand we will have to pay capital gains taxes on the shares sold. 

However, to put it simply, we are confused on how to transfer money from her account to pay off my credit without having to pay additional tax on a gift tax. We view this as our trust now and we view it as our debt. Not hers nor mine.

Does a gift tax apply here? Does my income increase due to this? If so, does it cancel out if she writes it off? Do I need to add her to this card first and she just pays it off? Can we just pay off that card using her account if her name isn’t on it? We are in the beginning stages of combining our finances and want this debt eliminated ASAP to start working with a loan officer as well as stop getting hit with interest.

I'm in about $9.5k of credit card debt across two cards that are both around 20% APR. I just started graduate school and have really low income—so low that I haven't made my credit card payments in the last two months. I have the opportunity to get a 6% student loan from the government that I wouldn't need to start paying for the next year and a half, though interest would accrue in that time. Note: I also have around $16k in loans to pay off from undergrad, which isn't accruing interest. 

Is it smart for me to take just enough of the loan to pay off the credit card debt entirely? If so, would paying it off all at once or incrementally be better for my credit?

474,personalfinance,"Hey all,

I was looking for some advice on managing your CC spending. I am in a much better position financially than I was say, 5 years ago (I'm 36 now). I've been living on my own for about 10 years now, and bought a house in the city I live in this last year.

I'm not concerned about my budget per say, but I guess I'm just looking for some advice with the direction I'm headed in.

When I first struck out on my own (left a LTR when I was 26), I relied heavily on credit cards to make ends meet. I have always had two jobs however, so I've been able to pay more than the minimum on them each month, if not clear them entirely. The most CC debt I've ever had was about 16k, and over the last few years I managed to get that down to the lowest in my adult life at 10k. I also used do a lot of research with balance transfer savings, and would take advantage of consolidating CC debt when I could just to have some extra money for the year. My goal is to avoid that in the future.

As everyone knows, these past few months have been tight with price increases and such, and I've realized I've begun relying on my CCs more than usual again. Currently, I have three credit cards with balances on them:

Fidelity (16.99%) - $1700 \[I've used this for everyday purchases so I could get points, then I pay it off entirely each month, or as close as I can\]

Chase ($24.99) - $1000 \[this is a relatively new one from Amazon that I used to purchase some home appliance/furniture when I first moved in. Ideally, I'll clear this next month and not use it again unless I need to buy something large off Amazon with an interest deal of some kind\]

Discover (0% until Jan 2024; 24.99% after that) - $8800 \[this is a CC consolidation I did a few months ago; I've been paying it off at $900/month)

Other than that I have:

Checkings: $3500

Savings: $7200 \[I deposit $100/week\]

401K: $5000 \[I meet my company's match\]

Trad IRA: $28200 

Roth IRA: $10700 \[I contribute $150/month for the time being, down from $500/year. The thinking being I want to really tackle my CC debt.

I've begun to realize that I 'rely' on my CC for everyday purchases like food, gas or groceries. So a couple of questions:

1) Does it make sense to continue using CCs and gaining points if I'm also able to juggle reducing my overall debt?

2) Would it make sense to pull from my savings and pay off a large chunk of my current CC debt, at my interest rates?

100% of contributions were to the State Street Equity 500 Index Fund Class K, with an expense ratio reported to be 0.02%

Every month, I seem to be assessed the following fee: “Fees - Allocation.” This occurred both in the months with contributions and the subsequent months where I was already maxed and no longer worked at the company. This is just some kind of general account fee.

He has a total of 3-5 clients that are very wealthy and hire him to care for their properties,  maintenance things around the house, and do personal work for them. 

He also struggles to get health insurance that isn't $750/month through a private plan. He he struggles to understand how to manage his taxes as a self-employed person under DACA. He has a lot of expenses with his business and also hires other immigrants to help out with some work in which he pays them in cash.  


The clients he is working for are offering him a salary instead of broken up payments of random work he does. Can he somehow get insurance through them if he gets paid salary?

490,personalfinance,"I opened a credit card a few months back and decided to start using it for daily purchases and paying it off multiple times a month to avoid interest, but still get the benefits of the card. 

I realized fairly quickly that it was difficult to keep up with my spendable balance since my banking app doesn't always show my true balance due to pending transactions and my credit card app is the same, so subtracting the balance owed on my CC from my checking balance was never completely accurate and I was occasionally overspending. I downloaded a very simple check register-esque app to track my daily spending to keep a running balance of how much spendable money I have available. I get paid monthly (on the first), so I set all of my monthly auto-draft expenses (car, bills, subscriptions, etc) to come out on the third of the month in case my paycheck hits on a weird day due to weekends, holidays, etc., and I manually enter each transaction as I make them (sometimes I have to backtrack, but never to the point of going zero). This ensures that even if my expenses don't actually get taken from my checking on the first-third, my app shows my spendable balance sans all expenses so I know there will always be enough money to cover all auto-drafts out of my checking. 

I try to pull excels of my CC account, checking account, and tracking app on a semi-regular basis to reconcile, and had everything matched to the penny back in mid-September, but now I have an outage somewhere that I CANNOT find at all and I can't seem to reconcile it to zero. I have no formulas going or anything, I just highlight the matching transaction and color code based on where the money came out (i.e. my CC or my checking account).

There were 4 separate 30 min sessions that I felt were not very helpful. Only take away for me was the education on portfolio balance. Even that was relatively brief - “Just buy 65% of this and 35% of this”. No education/direction on when a rebalance would occur or if increase investing/debt payoffs should take priority, etc. I felt scammed for 1200 and ultimately gave my feedback and cancelled, never to hear from them again. 

Am I expecting too much due to my smaller portfolio? If so, how can they get away with charging 1200 for the limited services provided. One email consultation, for a couple hundred bucks would have sufficed.

Tens of thousands of people have been laid off in the past few months with some getting a decent severance package but many not getting any compensation at all. If you have less than 10000 in your savings you can find yourself in hot water very quickly. Do not underestimate how quickly a few $1000 in your savings account can disappear when you have no income revenue coming in. Understand that unemployment is not nearly as much as many people believe it is and many times it can take 1 to 2 months to receive any money at all.  Don't go to the unemployment office, go straight to a temp agency close to you and see what jobs they have available. A lot of people don't even realize they exist but just Google temp agency near me and you'll see that they're pretty much in every city in town in the United States. They can often get you a job THE NEXT DAY. This is especially important for people that have no savings.  You would be lucky to get $300 a week in unemployment and like I said you won't get that for at least a month. You need to start making money immediately to stop the bleed. Once you've secured that job you need to immediately sit down and calculate what your weekly paycheck will look like and see what your entire financial standing is going to be. Calculate all your exbenson's and see if it's gonna even be enough to survive. You will likely need to begin immediately cutting back on expenses like eating out and look into getting an inexpensive phone plan, Internet, car insurance ect.

I've now had a pension at 3 of my last 4 jobs (including the job I just started). However, I didn't reach the vesting period for any of them. 

The contributions to Job 1 (pension) left me with $1,200 invested (spent 3 years there). 

Because I was young, naive, (and also more focused on my student loans), I was ONLY contributing to the pension, not considering that I wouldn't be vested if I left the job (which I did after things went south during the pandemic). 

Job 2 had a 401k, I spent a year there and invested about $10k

The contributions for Job 3 (pension) total about $2k. 

Job 4 has a pension (10 years to be vested, mandatory 1% salary contribution). They also have a TSP in which I'll contribute 5% (max) of my salary and they will contribute 2.5%.

Since the start of Job 3 (June '22), I have been investing about $450/month into a Roth IRA.

Things are looking up though as I just landed a big contract and hoping that this is a big year for me so I can get back on track. Here's my situation:  


I'm probably going to be making around 50-70k in the next three months. Trying to figure out best way to catch up on things and spend it. The 2nd half of the year I'd imagine I'd be making at least another 50-70k on top of it as long as business stay's normal which I imagine it would. I'm also looking for a salary remote job so ensure I have decent income the 2nd half of the year in case thins slow down. Our total household budget is normally around $7k/month.

Debt:

10k in student loan, been doing $100/month for a while to keep it from defaulting which is has in the past.

5k in credit cards

7k in a hospital bill from last year cause I was uninsured at the time.

A whooper 65K in back tax from years ago, accrued a ton of fees/interest and now trying to get it under 50k so I can cut a deal with IRS and shrink down the amount owed. I had a payment plan but it lapsed a few months ago when my income went way down. I'll probably work out another payment plan with them for $1000/month, but I'm assuming maybe I'll hold off this til end of year or next year to work out a deal paying off larger sum  


And then the big factor I'm trying to figure out is that me and my wife both need new cars. Mine has been paid off for a while but it's at 220k miles and is just hanging on. Our family car has like $500 left on the loan so will be paid off in two more months. But we've been sinking around $3k+ every year into in for repairs and the whole thing is literally falling apart and so much is corroding that I don't imagine it's worth spending another 4k-7k this year fixing it.   


Any recommendations on best way to proceed? I'm leaning towards maybe spending 20k downpayment on the cars (10k for each) to secure a decent loan.

I’ve been reading a lot of posts and the articles they’ve cited but I would feel better knowing that what I’ve found directly applies to my current situation so I apologize if this has been asked hundreds of times but I prefer to err on the safe side :)

Currently, I have two credit cards; My first credit card that has a limit of $1,000 and my second credit card that has a limit of $7,500. My first credit card was a student credit card and I never bothered to increase my credit card limit on that as it was more than enough at the time. My second credit card started off with $2,500 then they offered my $7,500 and because I was told that remaining under 30% is ideal, I went for it. 

My current credit score is 823 out of 900 and my 2nd credit card has offered me another increase to $15,500. This is obviously more than enough and I am certain that my monthly spending will likely total to around 6% utilization. I do plan on getting more credit cards in the future to maximize any benefits or rewards plans while making sure to have at least 1 monthly payment on each card. Will increasing my limit to $15,500 affect my credit score poorly especially when I gain more credit cards in the future as my utilization will start to approach 1% or is this ideal?

My partner is not really pumped to move since they have lived here their whole life, their parents are nearby which is helpful when we go away for a weekend and can have them dog-sit. They are an introvert and think that moving to a new city would make it difficult to make new friends.

I grew up in a big city and I like having options for things I want to do (food, experiences, outdoors, badminton, networking, etc.). I work in the Financial Services industry and at this stage of my life want to experience life outside of the midwest.

I have brought up Denver and Austin but the HCOL scares me a bit. I have a few friends in Denver which is where I am leaning to. We currently rent and have no plans on buying a house in the next 5 years. My job is remote so I can move without having to worry about that, although my income might stay the same given how they have divided the geographical pay scale (not 100% sure on that),

What are the things to consider while making this decision?  


I can't decide whether I want to move because the bigger city life seems ""better"" and have this notion of higher income potential if I were to switch jobs and the social media makes it look so cool - or do I genuinely believe my quality of life will improve by moving?

Appreciate any help!

535,personalfinance,"I purchased a vehicle and financed $42,000 ($7,000 of which was warranties). 

About 3 months later decided I wanted to cancel the warranties. No issue - dealership issued a check for the prorated amount of $6,750 to the lien holder on the vehicle. A month goes by but the lienholder still hasn’t reflected the refund. 

Dealership supposedly places a stop payment on the check they mailed, and re issues a new one (they assumed it got lost in the mail). 

I checked my line holder today and it’s now showing a payment of $6,750 was made on 1/05 and then another payment of $6,750 was made 1/10. 

So looks like the stop payment didn’t work and the dealership paid double.

I was browsing CD rates in Fidelity and have some very basic questions hoping somone can help me understand:

1) Call protected CDs: I understand that a callable CD means that the bank can call the CD early only returning your investment + interest up until that point. In Fidelity, this ""Call Protected"" column is indicated with a YES or NO. Does YES mean the CD is callable? Confused as to who is protected here. 

2) Coupon Frequency: Browsing through the different options, it seems as though some are monthly, some semi-annually, some at maturity. Does this mean how often interest is added to total account value? In the case of a monthly or semi-annual coupon frequency, I am assuming that those are better than ""at-maturity"" because the interest will compound during that period (if the total CD length is 1 year or longer).

1. Use my money to buy a rental property in America to generate passive income for my life in Asia. This seems like a lot of work but could have a huge upside if it works out.
2. Invest the money in America or leave it in my HYSA (I'm a noob to investing). This seems easiest and I'd just be renting a condo in Asia.
3. Use about 100k of the money to buy a small house or condo in Asia and never have to pay rent again. Leave the other 100k in America, invested in HYSA or something else.

587,personalfinance,"Hey all. So a little context here first. 

My fiancée and I met in college. After college we moved away to get away from her physically and financially abusive mother. Her mother is awful with money and has a big “credit cards are free money” complex that keeps them poor. 

So her mom took out 160k of parent plus loans (in addition to the 25k in my fiancées name that we’ve paid off) This was never discussed and my fiancée was just told “it’s being taken care of”. She was too lazy to fill out the FAFSA and instead took out loans for the entire balance. She then sprung it on us that we’d be expected to pay 1/2 of the loans upon graduation. I believe the monthly payment as of now is around $1000. 

We’re saving for a house, so we cannot really afford to be throwing away that much each month. (Like wanting to buy one within the next year. We’ve been living with my parents to save for going on 3 years) My other concern is her mother is known for making dumb financial choices to pay for things she doesn’t need. (Constant balance transfers. Multiple home equity loans). I’m concerned these loans were partially used to subsidize her spending and not fully used for school. Is there any way to confirm this ? 

The incomes we are working with are: 

Her Parents : About 60k a year 
Us: About 140k a year 

If it were up to me, I’d let them drown. It was their mistake and was never agreed to throughout school. However, my fiancée is worried that if we do that they’ll take it out on her sister who still lives with them. 

From what I can see, Parent Plus loans are eligible for IBR repayment plans which caps it at like 10% of discretionary income.

590,personalfinance,"My boyfriend and I, both mid 30s, have a decision to make of who moves where. I feel like there are pros and cons for all available options and I'm not sure what is the best route to take.

Current situation: My boyfriend lives in Chicago and is in federal law enforcement. His current salary is $80k but he will work his way up to $140k in about five years. He cannot leave Chicago for another 4 years in this current role. I live in a low cost of living city with total compensation of $160k a year. I am geographically limited on where I can work because I have a PhD in a niche field. The cost of living calculator shows Chicago is 30% more expensive than where I life. We want to be together. 

CHICAGO OPTION: My boyfriend stays in his current job. He makes $80k a year this year and I take a job making $115k. Total compensation between us is $195k immediately. Based on salary ranges from the lab I'd be working for, I expect in 5 years I'd be making $130k and he'd make $140k. Total compensation is $270k. Downside is my career, giving up being a lead researcher to support staff since there's nothing in the area that's in my area of research.

LOWER COL OPTION: I stay at my current job at $160k a year. He takes a job at the local police department making $70k a year. Total compensation is $230k. In 5 years, I anticipate my total compensation would be around $175k a year, but his would be capped out at $70k. Total between us would be $245k. Downside is his income being capped out and he'd be working a crappy schedule for a while until he gained seniority.

598,personalfinance,"So I’m looking for some advice on how balance transfers to existing credit cards work, because I have an idea on how to save myself some interest and I can’t tell if it’s great or foolish. 

Background: I currently have two credit cards and am carrying a balance of ~7k on each. Thankfully, I recently got a new job with a much higher salary, and I can finally afford to pay down this toxic debt. I’m planning to pay it down pretty aggressively and have calculated I can erase it all in 15-18 months (as it stands right now including interest). 

Both cards have recently offered balance transfer promos with low APRs (card A is 0.99% for 15 mos, card B is 0% for 9 mos). Card A has a credit limit of 23000, card B has 10000. 

My idea is… could I transfer the entire 7k balance of card B to card A, then do a second transfer back to card B, essentially swapping their balances but capturing both new promo rates for a nice period of very low interest??

It’s my understanding that, by law, CC companies have to apply any payment over the minimum to higher APR balances, so the whole plan hinges on the second balance transfer “payment” going to the higher APR debt and not just wiping out the first transfer. Would this indeed be the case, or am I getting my hopes up?

Also, is there a danger if I don’t pay off each balance before the promo periods end, and what should I look for in the fine print if I end up doing this? Thank you!",“Switching” CC balances to capture two promo rates?,1673445022

 I wrecked and rebuilt my credit over the past 10 years. From 800 to 500-something and back again to 770/780 now.  But my husband has AWFUL credit and a defaulted/garnished student loan (paused now, but will start again sooner or later.) Part of what helped me rebuild was my mother adding me as an authorized user on her Chase card but not really using it on my end except for like 2 emergencies that were paid back within 3 months each time. I never had any defaulted/garnished things though. 


 If I add my husband to help him start rebuilding and everything stays current/paid down or off, what happens to me because of his garnishment? Anything? We file taxes married but separate because otherwise I'd be tied to his debt but is this the same?

I (M/29) feel silly typing all this out, but I guess sharing the context makes me feel a little better about not having completely fucked off and knowing I've been working my ass off and trying to make things work. 

Like many others in this sub, I fell into the trap of credit cards in early college and then balance transfer cards to keep afloat while being a broke college student. I don't come from money, so I had to take out student loans as well as work all through college. Got an art degree, but there were no real job opportunities in my city, so I moved to NYC to pursue art and music. Freelancing actually seemed doable after getting a taste of a $600/day for a gig but that was short lived and COVID fucked up any real momentum and getting acclimated. I was able to save money after having to leave the city during lockdown while working remotely and managed to pay off most of my debt. Came back to the city to finish what I started and that debt quickly built back up. 

I quit my not so lucrative but ""stable"" retail job ($50k/year) to take a month off to record an album, got back into the service industry, was stoked on my workplace and making like $60k/year only to get laid off due to COVID spikes last winter.

Been working there for a little over 6 months for the sake of the connections and experience, but coming to terms now with the fact that I'm scraping $700/week on a 1099....that's like $36k a year before tax. Fully unsustainable in NYC. I picked up a second gig at a bar and was working 6 days a week for the past two months to make some extra money, but it wasn't nearly as lucrative as expected. Now it's the new year and I'm burned out and have no interest in grinding myself to death, for the sake of recovering from exhaustion i barely want to work 4 days a week. I could go back into working in a bar full time but I'm really, really sick of working til 2am and getting home at 3:30am or later, along with trying to avoid the casual alcoholism that people tend to slip into in the service industry.

I finally got an ADHD diagnosis and am trying to get a handle on my life as crippling debt really doesn't mesh well with anxiety, ADHD paralysis and a brain that's moving at a million miles an hour, all the time. Makes it real hard to get your shit together. So here we are. 

Let's get to the fun bits;

\-No savings account (lmao imagine that)

\-living paycheck to paycheck $700/week

\-my cut of rent is $975/month

\-no clue what my expenses are at this moment, brain is too fried from working so much and I haven't done a full grocery run since November as I full on haven't had the time or energy.

\-$23k in credit card debt, just realized I paid close to $900 in minimum payments/clearing over limit balances this past week across 7 accounts (jesus, that hits different typed out)

\-$23k in student loan debt (hoping $20k of that gets dropped if they pass that loan forgiveness bill that was frozen)

\-The only other thing on the table is like $1500 in a 401k that's probably never gonna go anywhere

Over the years, I've managed to amass a number of tools/assets (instruments, music equipment, cameras) that are valuable and will either continue to hold value or become more valuable. Currently that number sits somewhere around \~$27k. When shit has gotten real bad financially in the past, I've turned to selling off things that I feel okay with parting with to get me through the rough patch. Unfortunately I'm currently in a position where I don't have anything I actively want to give up as I've sort of narrowed it down to a bunch of high quality stuff that I got for cheap enough and it's all stuff that I actually use - by no means is it a ""collection"" or ""portfolio"" that is collecting dust. 

I've been hesitant to sell it all off because most of these things are unique and mean something to me and bring something to the table as tools. Also, if I sell it all, I'll have nothing left and starting over sounds like a fucking nightmare, especially in a world where everything is more inflated than usual and replacing these things down the line will cost me even more. This is getting into sort irrational/emotional lines of thinking but I digress.

What do I do at this point? I feel like the obvious answers are going to be ""you're an idiot, get a better job"" and ""sell all your shit and start over"", but I really truly love my job (despite the horrible pay) and I really would rather not sell all my shit as I kind of need it. Maybe a couple things to try and take a chunk out of the debt but it's gonna be hard to do. I've been considering a personal loan but from what I've read, the snowball method might be a better idea. How about bankruptcy? Not like anyone I know my age is gonna be able to afford a house anytime soon, and I don't need a car, who needs good credit lmao

628,personalfinance,"Hi all. I applied for a credit card last night but was declined because after putting that I am unemployed, I also put my yearly income was $0 because I thought it was asking about salary from a job, which I don't have.

The rejection letter stated that the reason for the rejection was because my income wasn't high enough to cover the credit, which of course sounds obvious.

So I'm wondering, if I do receive some form of money per year which can still be considered income, just not a salary from a job, should I reapply with that new information? Will it hurt to apply again so quickly? I'm guessing that if I were to put in that information, I would probably be approved, unless the previous rejection has some effect on the second application.

641,personalfinance," 

Hello all,

So let me explain the situation first. I have been somewhat over zealous with spending and before I knew it I am now in my overdraft by -£2900 of a 3500 limit.

I bank with Lloyds and at present i am being charged nearly £3 a day for being in it.

I earn £2385 monthly and my outgoings are around 1800 with Mortgage bills etc.(I also need to clear £450 Credit card and about £900 PayPal credit)  
I have a bonus coming around £1000 in March/April time -

My dilemma is this should I do a balance transfer to clear the overdraft get everything in order ( I have an offer for one £4000 over 28 months 0% interest ); doing this would mean every month hypothetically with me being more stern and keeping an eye on spending whilst building a very comfortable savings/safety blanket of money . This will clear the OD and the Credit card leaving me to focus on PayPal Credit in a matter of 3-4 months then finishing off the balance transfer over the next 28 months.

Alternatively I can try and go through some grit , do some overtime and it'll be cleared in a longer time frame - what worries me is when we need to remortgage at end of the year - I do not want to be still in this overdraft . That and if my car fails or my partners needs repairs or anything goes wrong with house it'll be an even dire situation !   
My Fiancé wants to Elope in October just to add a little pressure, I want to rectify this so she can have her dream.

As for what I could sell I have some pop vinyl's and Pokémon cards its whether they of any significant value though. 

I am cutting takeaways and am only using the car when needed amongst other things like cancelling subscriptions and choosing cheaper alternatives on groceries. 

I am beyond ashamed and embarrassed but I wanted to ask here before being trigger happy on clicking on the apply for a balance transfer . I understand whatever happens after this I need to get my head screwed on and really focus on finances more - this is a very hard lesson being learned.

All advice is appreciated - and if you got this far thank you for reading","Overdraft - Balance Transfer, Graft or Other options?",1673412710

658,personalfinance,"Hello PF! I (26M) am planning on moving to Chicago near the West Loop area and am running the budget on some places to look at. After a long hunting process I have narrowed it down to a place that has a rent of 2800 a month (including utilities). Let me break down my monthly budget:

I am a consultant so after taxes I take home around 6000-7000 USD a month, a little more sometimes if I work longer hours. 
I will take 6000 as the base limit and consider everything else above as added to my 401K. 

Rent - 2800 (2599 + 165 Utilities includes water, gas, cable and internet)

Electricity - 50

Groceries - 400 (Estimate for 1 person) 

Phone - 70

Car - 420 (Lease - I am keeping this car at my dads place in MI as I do not want to pay for parking and will have no use for a car, still will pay as it is my own car)

Auto Insurance - 110 

Loan - 500 (Pay my dad 500 a month for an Apt we own)

Credit Debt - 165 (0% Interest Loan that is 50% paid off ~1000 left)

Savings: 1200 Total
Roth IRA - 575
401K - 625

That leaves around 285 of ""fun"" money which is not much, however I did take a conservative base of 6000. If I end up taking more than 6000 in the month then that money could be used towards more savings or blown on alcohol and weed, granted it is not much more.

Is this a bad idea? This would be my first time living on my own while paying for everything myself. I have lived alone but never handled the financial stuff. I believe the rent is worth it and I do want to live in the downtown area and understand that is just the cost. Are there any hidden costs I am not thinking of maybe as a first time renter?

662,personalfinance,"Basic Information

I am 22, turning 23 this spring. I have a bachelors degree and I'm currently working in the Aviation industry.

Income + Existing Contributions

I currently net about $3,300 per month, rounding to $1650 per paycheck. I currently contribute 5% to my Roth 401(k), as I do not get a match my first year of employment. Once I hit one year of service at the company, if I contribute 9% I get a 6% match which is what I plan on doing. I also have an existing Roth IRA, which is not funded yet.

Expenses

I currently live at home with my parents (rent-free) and I pay off my credit cards in full each month which amount to around $600-700 each month. My car is also paid off.

Debts

As previously stated, I don't carry any credit card debt, auto, or any other debt other than student loans.

Currently my student loans are as follows:

$32,220.12 @ 4.40% - Federal DoE Unsubsidized Loan

$63,661.64 @ 5.22% - Private Loan

The Federal Loan is not currently accruing interest nor are payments due, however, the private loan carries a minimum payment every month of around $730. I currently pay $2000 a month just to accelerate the payoff due to the large balance.

Savings and Emergency Fund

I currently have around $7,500 in a savings account as an emergency fund. I know this is relatively low but it can easily cover six months of my expenses.

Questions

What is the best course of action? I would like to be debt-free, but also fund my retirement accounts and possibly save for a house so I can move out of my parents house. I am very fortunate for the situation I am in, as my expenses are minimal. I know that tomorrow is not promised but my earning potential is astronomical, as I should be making 110K+ at the beginning of 2024. I just feel lost as to where I should put my money.

How to reconcile on tax return? 

All contributions to the HSA were excess contributions since they we never an eligible person for contributing. 

They used most of the funds all 5 years towards medical expenses. 

I know all contributions are taxable - in the year they were made? So those years need to be amended to reflect this? 

Excise tax - what constitutes a withdrawal of excess in those years? Does using it towards medical expenses count as a withdrawal in this scenario? If the entire contribution amount was used on medical expenses - does that mean no excise tax would be owed in that year since the entire amount contributed was used towards medical? Or if only a portion was used toward medical expenses, is the amount that was left in the account at the end of the year the only amount that the 6% excise tax would apply? Or are they required to apply it to the entire amount contributed?

Are the distributions for medical expenses still considered qualified distributions? If not - does this mean they would owe the 20% earth distribution penalty on those distributions for each tax year they occurred?

I'm looking for some resources (ideally audio or video format) for my mom who is recently retired but almost completely financially illiterate.

She's extremely bad with money and isn't very forthcoming telling me her details (out of embarrassment and/or pride). 

What I know is that she had somewhere between 20-30k in cc debt. She recently got a low interest personal loan to pay this off (around 3%). She claims she has an emergency fund (""more than I need."") I don't know if this is real or not but I suppose I have to believe her. 

She did mention that she still has one credit card with leftover debt so the loan wasn't enough to cover ALL of it. 

For income she has social security and a pension from an old job, but won't tell me how much. Unsure about 401ks or IRAs. She still owes about 60k on her house and 13k on her car. Almost positive she has no investments

I know she's interested in doing better because I've been staying with her through the holidays and listening to financial podcasts, videos and audiobooks and she's listened in and asked me to pause so she can hear it. So I'm hoping to find something to watch / listen to specifically on budgeting for retirees just to get her brain going. 

But almost everything I find online is about planning for retirement and not a lot of content for folks who are already retired but without much equity. 

Anything would help. She won't read a book but she'll piggy back off anything I watch or listen to so I figure to maximize this while I'm here.

709,personalfinance,"I'm in my 50s, shooting for early retirement, maybe 60, not sure.  I have 8x salary saved.  Most if it is in traditional 401k, with half as much in Roth IRA and about half that much in muni bonds in a brokerage account.  

I was thinking about changing my contributions for my remaining working years to Roth 401k to try and increase my after tax funds.  But I'm second guessing that.  It will be hard for me to contribute the max (30k with catchup) if it's after tax funds.  I'm currently at the lower end of the 24% tax bracket.  

Since most of my non-retirement account assets are after tax and that's what I'd be living on for a while, my taxable income will plummet after retirement. Would I not be better off continuing to put as much as possible into traditional 401, and then after retirement when my taxable income drops, gradually start reclassifying the traditional 401k funds into Roth and paying off the taxes at a lower rate?   My goal would be to be convert enough of it, so that for the remaining years I can pull slowly pull from the remaining tax infested funds without also triggering taxes on my SS checks.  I haven't decided yet in what year I'll file for SS.

What I'm unclear of is the process and restrictions of doing a Traditional to Roth conversion.  When I've seen retirement planners speak about this on youtube they seem to recommend to people that they roll over their entire account at once.  Given that some of these people have huge 401ks this would result in a huge taxable windfall.  Is it not possible to say rollover 50k/year starting the year after you retire  so your magi is all taxed at the 12% rate or is it really all or nothing?

I am here to seek some financial advise regarding what to pay off, and even if I should, using the money I have saved up.

I make $43,000 annually pre-tax at my primary job. I DoorDash on the weekends, earning about $200-$300/week.

I currently have $10K in savings. I have three credit cards with the following balances and interest rates: Wells Fargo, $8K, 22.4%; Chase, $1,800, 26%; Synchrony, $1,900, no interest until Dec. 2023. Student loan debt is $10K. I'm using the snowball method to pay these balances off.

I am planning on purchasing a house with my fiance in the latter half of the year.

Would it be worth to cut down on my debt now and build that back up later via primary job and DoorDash? Or should I hang on to it for that down payment on the home and continue the snowball method (my fiance will also be contributing to the down payment, so I won't exhaust all of the funds)?

My dilemma is that there are a handful of not totally necessary purchases I'd like to make, like revamping the bathrooms. I have the funds to cover this in cash with a bit extra for wiggle room.

She provided them months ago with itemized receipts and insurance charge statements, showing that she owed a little over $100 for her ER visit (she has an itemized receipt from the hospital and insurance cost share receipt). The total cost of treatment was around $1800, but she was insured and was responsible for the balance of \~$100. She promptly paid that balance in 2019 and thought that was the end of it.

They sent her an ""itemized"" statement that said little more than she owed \~$900.

750,personalfinance,"Hello all, I am just seeking some advice on some of my financing.

I am about to start receiving an extra $400 USD a month that will not have to be used for any of my daily living expenses, and will be extra money. I am a little stumped on what I should do with it.

I have thought about a few different possibilities to use it with.

1. Use the money and apply it towards my principal and pay off my loans faster, allowing me to free up monthly payments in the future.
2. Store the money in a bank account, and use that to pay what bills I can with it, allowing me to free up $400 worth of monthly payments now.
3. Store the money in a savings account and use it for rainy day scenarios.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I have 4 loans, 3 personal and 1 secured.

Loan A, I owe $3574 principal, have roughly 25 months left, pay $143 a month, and it is at 22.408% APR.

Loan B, I owe $672 principal,  have roughly 9 months left, pay $74 a month, and it is at 0% APR if paid in full within 2 years (on track to do so)

Loan C, I owe $2845 principal, have roughly 25 months left, pay $194 a month, and it is at 42% APR.

Loan D, my car note, I owe $19,429 principal, have roughly 40 months left, pay $449 a month, and it is at 12.10% APR

&amp;#x200B;

I have one medical collection on my card, which I do plan on paying off first, but after that I am unsure what the best option would be.

My credit score is 637, which needs some work, so I do not wish to lower it even more by paying loans off too quick.

I can honestly do better on my budgeting, as I do not have a ton of money in savings currently, but this is mainly due to me overspending on un-needed expenses, but between my current monthly income, not including the extra $400, and my current bills/loans, I come out with about $800 a month in profit, not including my SO's income. 

Does anyone have some insight on what my best route would be for this extra $400?

So I jointly own a vehicle with my(former) friend. I know I’m an idiot. Crazy thing is that I’ve always been a logical person but I was blind to the kind of person she is for the longest time. 

Anyways, we’re in Arizona, its co-ownership with each of us having equal rights to the vehicle as well as equal financial responsibility. Checked with the DMV and the loan is an OR. I’m the primary on the loan as I have good credit and I am the first person they reach out for any reason. I’ve received now 5 repossession notices from the bank as she’s been 2-3 months behind each time but has been able to get caught up, after I harrass her mom into getting her to pay or her mom may be paying not sure. The bank said out of these 3 years her first 2 payments have been the only ones made on time. $650 in late fees at this point. Signed in 2019, but she pushed back nearly a years worth of payments due to “covid”. Not even halfway through this loan with nearly 3 years left. I’ve communicated openly and honestly with the bank and stood firm in my refusal to pay. I had perfect credit before this mess so at this point I’m willing to have a repossession on my record if it means to get rid of this attachment to her. She doesn’t answer the phone or text messages. I have no idea where she lives. I’ve offered to take the car off her hands multiple times but she has no means to get a different one.

I’m going back to work after being a stay at home mom for a few years and I want to settle this. My address is the only address on file, I could pay off the vehicle and get the title in hand. From here I could transfer ownership into my name only without her signature or being present. -already confirmed with DMV. Problem is she has the vehicle in her possession. She had tags suspended for lapse in insurance and her mom confirmed she was still driving it. Do I take her to court, I feel like courts don’t waste their time with things like this. Or just suffer lol I don’t even know. I feel horrible to think that way I don’t want to be shystie and take the car out from under her but its beginning to financially negatively impact my family.

I am 23 years old but have been working in IT since I was 18. Since I started so early I get paid pretty well in comparison for someone my age. I currently make $35 a hour which is about 70k a year.

I am not gonna go into detail about what we talked about but I saw no other option except to take on the debt myself. So I paid 5 thousand of it on the spot with money I had hidden away and then took on another 4k into 0% interest credit cards that I had gotten to pay for the honeymoon because her interest was 29%..... I know. Now I have 4 thousand dollars of credit card debt (0% interest) and I am trying to pay it off affecting how much we were gonna have after we got married.

774,personalfinance,"I'm 36, and my wife is 34. We have a taxable account, Roth &amp; a 401K. I am trying to learn more about investing for a comfortable retirement and/or passive income. I tried to take the approach of investing on my own after watching several YouTube videos and reading several articles online. I thought I had a good strategy, but it turns out I have a lot to learn. We owe 140K on our mortgage at a 2% interest rate. Rather than pay it off, I decided to open a taxable account in hopes of getting a better return than 2%, thereby justifying my decision of not paying off the mortgage. I have 3 accounts at Fidelity that I self-direct investments in 1 Roth for myself, my wife's Roth, and an individual account. 

Roths: My wife and I both have Roths setup identical: VTI 70%, VXUS 30%. Each Roth has a total value of 23K. I just rebalanced these they were both FXAIX 45%, FZROX 45%, FZILX 10%. I originally wanted to see how FXAIX &amp; FZROX would perform over a few years side by side. FXAIX outperformed FZROX, but I understand the importance of having exposure to the entire market after reading several reddit posts, so I changed my investments to VTI/VXUS. I also like that ETFs can be bought/sold anytime vs. index funds at the end of the day. I almost went with ITOT/IXUS but ultimately chose the Vanguard etfs due to these etf's having more holdings. 

Taxable: My taxable at Fidelity was 100% individual tech stocks ( I know, I know). I started investing heavily Jan 2022, my plan was to buy stocks that I could hold for 10 years, give or take, and that I felt would not go bankrupt and would be worth much more when I sold them. I assumed the more risk, the more reward, and at first it seemed like a good strategy, but I could not take the pain and sold everything when my losses got to be too much (Dec 2022). This was an 80K loss, I understand that when filing my taxes, I can claim 3K per year against my income and carry this forward each year ( i have no gains to offset). That is all I can do at this point. Tough lesson learned.  Now I am reading, researching &amp; asking experienced investors for their advice so that I never lose that amount of money again.

 Fidelity taxable account: 140K &amp; it is parked in SPAXX. I'm thinking about setting it up identical to my Roth with maybe a small cap tilt, something like VTI 50%/ AVUV 20%/VXUS 30%. Any thoughts? Am I investing in too much of the same thing across these accounts? What would you do? CDs? I have also considered closing this account and eventually buying a rental property since it looks like there is a housing market correction on the horizon. I do not need this money in the near term, but I can't handle watching the value drop like it did with individual stocks. I would like to create passive income with this taxable account that will justify not paying off my 2% mortgage loan.

Investment allocation &amp; expense ratios: 55% Blackrock S&amp;P 500 index portfolio ER .28, 15% Blackrock US small/ Mid Cap Equity Index portfolio ER .30, 15% JP Morgan US Large Cap Equity Portfolio ER .66, 15% Vanguard Health Care Index Portfolio ER .36. This account has been the hardest for me to decide on allocation due to the funds offered not being that great.  They offer an american funds international equity portfolio ER .72, Wasatch small Cap equity portfolio ER 1.11, Vanguard information technology Index portfolio ER .36, Vanguard balanced index ER .32, SIP stable value portfolio ER .31, John Hancock fixed income portfolio .49 &amp; Target Date: State Street Retirement  2045 portfolio ER .33%.

777,personalfinance,"Hi there! I’m posting this on behalf of my father as his daughter. 

My dad is 55 and has no retirement plan or savings. He owns a house but based on conversations he mentioned still owing a large amount (assuming he means well into his 60s or 70s). But my concern really lies in him not having any form of retirement savings accounts. As a 23 year old who just landed my first “real” job I am just now understanding and learning about 401k, Roth IRAs, HYSA and setting this up for myself. But, I’m learning all this for the first time and I’m trying my best to explain to my dad that he should set this up now. Problem being, my dad is very cautious and wary about putting his money into something (especially now in this economy). But I’m convinced it’s more so that he’s never really known what options he has. We are and have grown up as a low income first generation household - with no experience or relatives who can help us navigate retirement planning or investments and such. I’ve just now convinced him to open a HYSA to keep about 15k that he’s just had sitting in his checkings (I know that’s just the bare minimum) and to discuss his 401k options with his employer. I know since he’s only starting at 55 he needs more. I’m doing my own research but I see conflicting options for opening an IRA at his age. Would a traditional or Roth IRA be better? His income most likely won’t increase significantly through the remainder of his career and most likely stay in the lowest tax bracket. I see that’s one of the most common ways to decide but I’d like to know if there’s anything else to consider. I’m hoping to convince him to open an ira and place the max 7k that he can and then add rest to the HYSA. Is that wise? Idk. If you’ve read this far- thank you so much!

792,personalfinance,"Hi all, with the new year I did some thinking about my long-term financial goals, and there are two things I have always wanted:

* Retire early
   * I don't hate working, but I want to be financially independent and have the freedom to do what I want in life, travel, non-profit work, startups, etc. And the quickest way to achieve this is to build up enough savings to retire early
* Own a penthouse/large single-family home
   * This is obviously a luxury/ambition. But I really feel like it's the American dream to own your own place and have a big house for your family and friends. Unfortunately I live in a very HCOL city, and the average cost of one of these ranges between $2M to 3M. The only alternative would be to move out of this city, but I am tied to this area for now due to my job

Here are the steps that I have taken to accomplish my goals and other personal info:

* I am in my early 20s, making $170k pre-tax annually (working for about 3 years), excluding RSUs
   * On average I have received 8 to 13% raises/promotions per year
   * I get about 20k to 30k of RSUs a year vested over 4 years quarterly
* I max out my 401k and HSA contributions and employer match with a combined total of $120k right now
* I max out my Roth IRA which sits at 20k
* Beyond that I have accumulated personal savings/brokerage for another $120k.
* With the good pandemic housing market in 2021, I bought up a small home for about 600k with about 400k remaining on it (making extra monthly payments to principal)

In order to retire early in my 30s, I would expect to need about $2.5M to 3M. At the same time, to own a penthouse/large single-family home it would also cost that much. From my perspective, beyond becoming a millionaire somehow and/or vastly increasing my income it doesn't seem possible to do both.

807,personalfinance,"Specifically, the basement/crawlspace and attic are very cost-effective places to insulate. This is especially true for houses older than a couple decades. I have no personal stake in the insulation business and say all this as someone who learned from working on my own home. Here are some tips:

* Basement/crawlspace: are the walls just bare concrete? Is there any insulation between the joists under the house's floor? If no to both--or if there is insulation under the floor but it's sagging or damp--the insulation is inadequate and you're losing tons of energy (and money) through the foundation walls.
   * These days, [most people advise insulating the inside of the foundation walls](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-insulate-crawl-space-4796956) and not under the first floor (though if you already have insulation under the floor and it's in good shape, you can keep it).
   * I'm a fan of [EPS foam board](https://www.homedepot.com/p/R-Tech-2-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-R-7-7-Rigid-Foam-Insulation-310891/202532856) because it's cheap, works well, easy to DIY, and causes less pollution than other types of foam. Colder climates will probably want 2 layers of foam board (R-15); warmer climates might be ok with 1. In my case, I calculated a payoff time of around 2-5 years for adding these; it would be even faster if I kept my house at more typical heating/cooling temperatures.
   * If you have a crawlspace, you may want to seal the crawlspace floor with a vapor barrier (""encapsulation""). If you have a moisture problem down there, you should definitely do that. Now is a good time to run a cheap test for [radon in your house](https://www.epa.gov/radon/how-do-i-get-radon-test-kit-are-they-free) to protect you and your family from lung cancer; if you have radon, encapsulating the crawlspace will be a big part of the treatment.
* Attic: [if you have an attic, blowing in insulation is cheap and you can rent a machine to DIY it if you want. ](https://www.thespruce.com/cut-energy-bills-with-blown-insulation-1398049)Take a look up there and use [this site](https://insulationinstitute.org/im-a-homeowner/about-insulation/how-much-do-i-need/) to determine if you have enough, and how much you should add.
* Walls: unlike attics and crawlspaces, walls are harder and more expensive to insulate. However, if you're doing a remodel project that involves removing wall sheathing already, you should definitely assess whether you wall insulation is adequate, and improve it if needed. [This site](https://insulationinstitute.org/im-a-homeowner/about-insulation/how-much-do-i-need/) has some notes on wall insulation at the bottom.
* Sealing leaks: this is potentially the most cost-effective item on the list. Search for leaks in the crawlspace and attic (easiest before insulation is added). Leaks in the house matter too, but leaks at the top and bottom of the house matter most. There's a good chance you'll find holes big enough for a cat to crawl through, and those should be blocked with wood or foam board. Smaller leaks can be sealed with spray foam or caulk.
* Energy assessment: you can hire an expert to come out, assess how leaky your house is and whether the insulation is adequate, and recommend fixes.",A new 30% federal tax credit on insulation means now is a great time to reduce your heating/cooling bill,1673380113

As I said it's a remote job so I'm home 5 days a week and spend the weekends running errands, and seeing my SO and family, I have no social life whatsoever, feel extremely miserable, and absolutely HATE my job. I have no passion for it and it's def not in the field I'm interested to pursue a career in.

I have around $4000 in my savings, I don't have any debts, and am moving back with my parents (not the most ideal situation but I don't have any other choice) starting next month. I also won't have to pay next month's rent for my apartment since it was paid as a deposit when I moved in.

So my expenses for the next few months would be food, restaurants (only when I'm with my SO), phone, and monthly subscriptions (around $30/month).

Do you think it's a reasonable decision to quit my job? there's absolutely no room for growth for me in this job and my mental health is deteriorating due to having to stay in all day all week.

836,personalfinance,"Last year, I made the mistake of choosing an apartment that was more expensive that I should've gone for. At the time, I was making enough to afford it and had a couple thousand of savings for emergency funds. I had to budget in order to keep all my funds in place but it wasn't stressful.

Jump to July, and I quitted my job due to work harassment. I found another job quickly but it didn't pay as much and was almost worse. I quit that one too and am now working one that pays great but I barely get 30 hours when they promised full-time. I also had a month in-between jobs where I used all my savings for rent.

I now have to live check-to-check with a job that doesn't pay enough. I've been late on rent every month (which is an added $200 late fee) and they're threatening eviction if I don't pay by the 20th this month. My lease ends first week of March so I don't think they'll actually evict me but I'm worried I won't be able to get another apartment with my funds being zero at the end of each month due to rent. Also, I really doubt my landlord is going to put in a good word at this point if they check references (my previous two apartments though would cite me as never paying late). 

I've tried applying for personal loans and credit cards but I've been rejected due to not making enough money ($35000 per year). My credit is 650 so it's not terrible. I've been selling old electronics and video games just to make rent at this point. 

I'm not really sure what to do. I'm looking for a new job which hopefully will be able to lessen the stress a bit but I'm so behind in payments right now and it's stressing me out. I can't move back home because it's an unhealthy environment. I have two cats so rooming with other people usually isn't going to work, and I have a bf who'd probably let me live with him but I really don't want to resort to that (it's only a few months into the relationship).

Investment | Interest Rate | Yield post-tax | Tax Exemptions

Dear (supervisor aka business director) and (HR director),

When I first found [employer name], I was elated to find a district that worked just as hard as they had fun. The ""good of the whole"" and ""no child left behind"" and ""every child"" mentality gave me hope for education that I’d started to lose. Right away I knew that I wanted to find a permanent place here. Not to sound overly dramatic, but I have found way more than I realized I would in this job. I have found purpose, I have found passion, and I have found balance in my work.

As I hit my one-year review, I feel so proud of how far I have come. When I initially started this job, I wasn't sure what it entailed--it was uncharted territory but I was excited for the adventure. I know I have a great ability to handle a large capacity of learning, conflict, and perseverance, but this job has challenged me beyond my imagination and I honestly think I am better for it. I have started learning new languages like HTML and SQL. I have learned extensively about [my state]’s laws around education, not to be confused with my new knowledge of federal programs like McKinney-Vento. I have learned the ins and outs of state reporting, managing clean data, and showing up for people when they need it and their tasks depend on it. I have learned how to create extensive spreadsheets that answers important, district wide questions. I have served every single director on this campus (maybe minus the maintenance director:) and every principal.

I name all of this not because I am not humble or lack a sense of humility, but really because I believe what I do is important and I'm proud of that. Additionally, I don't think my compensation fairly matches my role's responsibilities. From my research, which considers all major tasks I am in charge of or support, a starting base for my position that would seem to support market value is $70,820-$78,400. This considers  enrollment coordinating, being an IT tech and helping with helpdesk tickets around data and our SIS, being our SIS’s programmer, and of course being our district's registrar, along with having a large role in state reporting. While I don't have a ""perfect"" number in my head to ask for, I do want to be valued at the fair market rate.

I initially wanted to give this job my all for one year before I presumed to understand it's worth. Now that I have, I would like to continue this work indefinitely and I feel I now have the knowledge to understand what it truly takes to be successful at this job and what that means fiscally.

845,personalfinance,"Hey folks, I was just informed that my job is relocating me and the family to Denver this summer. Looking at the house prices there however has had my wife and I somewhat panicky and unsure of how much house we can truly afford. To get something similar to what we currently own would be around the $800k mark, an almost 175% increase to what we paid for our house. We are currently a one income family (soon to change when my wife completes her degree in a few years) with a 5 y/o who will start kindergarten this year. Here's a quick breakdown of our finances:

Income: $168k a year
VA disability: $27k a year
Equity in current home: Approx. $200k
No CC debt
Current Mortgage: $265k remaining on $310k at 3.25% or $1700/mo
Student Loans: $28k (deferred while wife is in school)
Vehicle: $9k ($529/mo at 3.49%)
401k/IRA/HSA: Maxed each year
Savings: $5k
Health Insurance/Dental: $5.6k a year
Pension Contribution: $8k/year
Credit Score: 800+

When we sell our current residence I plan to pay off the vehicle with equity to save us another $529 per month. Minus the realtor fee of approximately 3%, that would give us a ballpark range of around $180k to use as a down payment for our next home. My napkin math at the end gives us approximately $5000 a month or so that we could technically use towards a mortgage. However, that would likely leave us with nothing leftover outside of our budget which is unrealistic. I've since ran the numbers through a mortgage calculator for an $800k home with a 30 year term at 6% and got an approximate of $4200 a month. 

So while the numbers do work in theory, I'd like a second, third and fourth pair of eyes to make sure we aren't crazy to try and take on a mortgage like this.",Can we afford a VHCOL city?,1673376404

I went to my Dentist today for regular teeth cleaning but they found a cavity. I've an appointment (with 48 hours to cancel with no fee) set for later this week but I'm stunned at the bill for this and was wondering if I'm getting ripped off.

* Dental Warranty Fee GFM

862,personalfinance,"Per title, would it be possible to refinance my personal loans for significantly under 15% apr? I have $45k across two high interest personal loans, with 16% and 21% APR.  I initiated these about a year at a total $80k principal, and have focused heavily on paying down the 21% loan (about $12k left).  If not possible to get a worthwhile APR then I assume I'm probably best just paying them off as a priority. Here are some more facts to consider:

I have about $270k income (salary); mid 30's, no house (rent+parking+utilities is about $2500/month); 750+ credit score (680 at loan initiation); $85k in federal student loans averaging about 6.5% APR (covid frozen, but that will end soon); and $45k in aforementioned personal loans at 16-21% APR.  I just started receiving this high salary about a year ago, as I used to be in non-profit/public interest before going back to school, so I don't have significant non-retirement savings -- only have about $10k in spare cash. I have no issue making the monthly loan payments and have in fact paid off significantly faster to avoid interest, but I would like the flexibility to add to retirement or dca into investments when reasonable, and also to maintain an emergency fund for potential layoffs in this economy, unforeseen medical, etc.  I've tried things like lending tree to estimate loan rates, and all the preliminary offers are 15% or above which makes it seem not worth the credit hit for the small amount of interest I would be saving (would like to potentially buy a house in next few years).

Interested in what you all think about refinancing vs paying off. Also, if you have any insight on the feasibility of refinancing the fed student loans at a worthwhile rate (when the time comes) that would be helpful as well.

883,personalfinance,"**Key points**

* How ""cash rich"" strategies can benefit in a high interest rate environment
* The advantage of holding treasury bills
* How to purchase treasury bills in a TD Ameritrade account

Defined outcome strategies that I have been using to reduce my risk in the market are net credit or neutral, meaning when you execute an outcome no cash is used. I don't like to use margin (or “naked” options), the short puts in my defined outcome trades are fully collateralized. Meaning any active outcome typically holds capital in the form of cash in my brokerage account until maturity. In the event of assignment, I have the cash ready to purchase shares at the strike price assigned. As a result, this kind of investing strategy is considered ""cash rich."" 

**Why it matters:** In a zero interest rate environment, holding cash is fine because there is no opportunity cost. But as risk-free interest rates rise, the opportunity to generate income on cash can be substantial.  

**What can you do?** Use the cash being held as collateral to buy treasury bills. The [current annualized yield](https://ycharts.com/indicators/3_month_t_bill#:~:text=3%20Month%20Treasury%20Bill%20Rate%20is%20at%204.51%25%2C%20compared%20to,day%20and%200.09%25%20last%20year.) on a 3 month treasury bill is 4.51%. There are several reasons why you might choose to hold Treasury Bills instead of cash:

* **Safety**: Treasury Bills are considered to be very safe investments because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. This means that there is no risk that you will lose your money if you hold Treasury Bills until maturity.
* **Yield**: Treasury Bills typically pay a lower yield than other investments, such as stocks or bonds. However, they may still offer a slightly higher yield than cash, which typically does not pay any interest.
* **Liquidity**: Treasury Bills are very liquid, which means that they can be easily bought and sold on the open market. This makes them a convenient investment option if you need to access your money quickly.

**How to purchase treasury bills**

One of the easiest ways to buy treasuries as well as other fixed income investments is using the bond wizard on TD Ameritrade. They've got educational resources that walk you through the steps to add treasury securities to your portfolio.

Right now I am at a loss, the responsible side of me doesn't want to get a new car even though I could afford it. The other side of me doesn't want to buy a used car for $2k-$3k less and miss out on the manufacturer warranty and the fact that it has miles on it. 

I have $10,000 I'm willing to put down on a car. I'm trying to figure out whether I should try to find a beater that won't kill me in maintenance costs, buy a cheaper used car that will depreciate thousands of dollars once the market flips. Or buy a nice shiny new car that will hold its value a bit better and won't come with the headache of a used car. 

Right now I'm looking at Hondas or Toyotas, I qualify for their recent graduate program of $500 off and my credit is good enough to get their lower APRs (\~2.9%-3.9%).

My family are all spenders, I am a saver..... at least I try to be. These higher interest student loan rates are driving me up a wall. If I were to invest money I could put towards my student loans it'd probably be a wash considering how high those rates are.

If anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate it, I can't deal with listening to my family tell me what to do anymore.","My car was stolen, I need some advice",1673369400

902,personalfinance,"I recently posted about the Experian Breach, and also a step by step guide to secure you digital Identity. Once thing I have seen mentioned a lot , and even in the Wiki, is password managers/vaults.  This is what I use and why.

I don't use a password vault. Well, not really.

I use Google. There is only one  password  not in it- the Master Google account one (and it's something like (8iH1@DK19!19jAwkkKj). All passwords are different, and all are random strings.

I also use 2fa on the Google account- using a Google Voice number tied to account (which was fine until one day when I went to ubreakifix, I wiped my Pixel device without thinking, and permanently locked myself out of my Google account (Gmail and Google Voice).


Problem was the 2fa would send a authentication code to either that email, or to that Google Voice number.  I couldn't access the account in order to retrieve the code to authenticate the account to gain access to the account. So basically I effed myself, and  the random alpha numeric symbol password was useless.

4 months later Google sent a account recovery link to my Microsoft recovery email account. I am glad I had the foresight to set that up, and confirm it prior to this.

I won't ever get locked out again though as I created the Google Security [backup codes](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1187538?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid), and backed them up to a biometric locked file on another non-Google account, and one backup code, and the Google Password is in my wife's possession. 10 codes. One time use.

Basically, even if someone got my Password to my Google account which contains all my saved passwords, they cant access the account without authenticating and getting a text code to the Google Voice account which requires authentication to access itself (or by using an account authentication one time use backup code).

Google Voice numbers can't be ported without being unlocked after account authentication, and there is no SIM to swap.

My own situation, I graduated grad school in August and I was luckily hired right out of grad school making 85K a year, which isn’t a lot in NY, still I am extremely grateful that I was one of the lucky students that found something. 

I am currently in 15K credit card debt spread over 4 credit cards. I have a Sallie Mae loan for 16K with payments set to begin in April. I have a Federal Government loan with payments set to begin in September, 2023 for $270,000, which I plan on paying back through IDR. 

For more context, Before grad school I was in virtually no Credit Card debt, but after fighting with my parents I had to move out twice (once before grad school and once during) and that’s where most of my credit card debt came from. I did not have a stable job while living on my own &amp; used the school loan to cover off campus housing while using my CC to cover living expenses. I was also in two car accidents (one before grad school, one during) which caused me to dip into my Credit Cards even further &amp; that’s essentially how I ended up in this much CC debt. 

After following this page I made my own kind of personal finance sheet and wanted to know if I could be more efficient in tackling my debt. 

Income: $85,000 
Take Home Pay After Taxes: $2270 Biweekly ; $4540 Monthly 

Sallie Mae Loan: $16,000 12%APR 

Credit Card debt
American Express: $5330 - 29.99% APR

Discover: $5611 - 24% APR

Apple Credit Card: $3755 - 26% APR

Capital One: $900 - 27.74% 
[P.S called my banks and no one would lower the APR, in total I’ve had all CCs for about 4-6 years while only making the minimum payment, before grad school I had a job at Apple working full time and that’s why the CC company’s gave me a high credit limit. When I was working full time &amp; before my accidents &amp; before grad school my FCIO score was around 760. Moving out / the car accidents / leaving apple to go to grad school are what really messed me up.]

My main goal is to pay down my CC debt as efficiently as possible. I am currently paying 240$ a month towards my Amex &amp; Discover Credit Cards simultaneously and plan to raise that to 300$ by April or May if I can afford it. I am paying 180$ towards my Apple Credit card &amp; $50 towards my capital one. In sum, I am paying over the minimum amount for everything. 

I recently sold my car, and I have had to suck up my pride and move back in with my parents so I am not paying rent or car payments/insurance. I plan on paying the Sallie Mae loan over 8 years which would be 270$ a month but I am thinking of just making the minimum payment there &amp; putting the money left over towards my Amex/Discover card instead. 

I would like advice on my Credit Card payment plan, does that sound like a good idea or would the snow ball method be better? I believe because my APR &amp; my debt for Amex/Discover card being relatively the same I am better off paying them down at the same time than only focusing on the Amex card.

959,personalfinance,"I currently have a credit card with Capital One that I'm paying off - it currently has just under £1,500 outstanding. At present, with my new job, I'm paying £100 a month off. I have a direct debit set up also that takes the 'minimum payment required' which is usually around £50, and then I'm charged around £50 in fees, so these offset. I want to sort of nip that latter part in the bud, and explore the options of using an interest-free balance transfer credit card, even if it's only going to save me a couple months of fees, that still helps.

I've ran checks through Experian and been offered the Vanquis Balance Transfer Card: 2.9% transfer fee applies; APR: 29.3%; with 0% on balance transfers for 9 months.

The wording on the contract has caused some confusion for me, so I'm hoping someone can help clarify. It reads:

*- Unless there is no money owing on your account, every month, you will need to pay a percentage of the balance outstanding on your account. We will tell you what your monthly minimum payment percentage is when we open your account.*  
*- Your monthly statement will clearly show the minimum payment you need to pay and by when you need to pay it (the 'payment due date'). Your minimum payment may vary from month to month depending on how you’ve used your account. For more information about how we calculate your minimum payment, please refer to the Summary Box.*

Summary Box can be found  [Vanquis Balance Transfer card 29.3% APR feature summary - Vanquis](https://www.vanquis.co.uk/summary/29-3-BT-9M) , where it states a rate of 2.16%, and *""0% on balance transfers made within 60 days of account opening for 9 months from the date of transfer""*. So, is it correct that the minimum payment they expect is 2.16% of the total outstanding balance?

Essentially, if I take this card, transfer my Capital One (34.9% APR) balance to this Vanquis card (29.3%), would the next 9 months be 'fee free'? So I won't be hit with that odd-£50 fine, pay off an additional £900, and only then around September/October start getting that fee again - all in all saving me about £400-450?

965,personalfinance," 

I live in an apartment with three others. One roommate has lived here for 6 months and has consistently been behind on rent/utilities. He hasn't really been looking for work in this timeframe either.

This has caused him to fall months behind on rent/utilities and our landlord has contacted us that we need to send in all of his outstanding payments by eod to avoid moving forward with collections. According to her, since all of our names are on the lease, we are all equally liable in collections despite us three always paying on time. When this roommate signed the lease originally, he had his dad sign as a guarantor since he had no income at the time. The guarantor is his father who has not been particularly responsive. We talked to him last night and he did not seem confident that he's able to pay moving forward (lease goes through June).

None of us are comfortable loaning him the money since we have seen how hard it is to get him to pay things back. We have kept our landlord in the loop every step of the way and have a call with her today to talk through next steps.

These are my questions:

1. According to the guarantor language below, do we have any leg to stand on in terms of isolating collections on the roomate/guarantor not paying rent?
2. Assuming he can't pay today, it seems like the only option is to cover his outstanding balance, so we don't take the credit hit, and begin looking for a new roommate. Are there any other options I'm missing?

Obviously as an individual of somewhat modest means I don’t have the cash laying around to buy such an expensive thing outright, so financing will be involved. 

My research has brought me to what is called a tax lease, which is a loan term commonly offered by lenders that specialize in capital equipment investments like this. Essentially a lease term is set up (similar to a loan) with a purchase option at the end of it, at which point you would own it outright. The monthly lease payments up until that point are then tax deductible since you’re technically “renting” the equipment for business purpose. 

My question is do you have to have an LLC established to realize these benefits, or could you write this off against your day job’s W2 (which is currently my sole source of income)?  Reason I ask is I’ve come across vague references to a requirement that specifies use of the equipment for business purposes in order to be able to write off the lease payments against your taxable income. Obviously if the IRS wanted to look, you’re going to have a harder time proving business use if you don’t yet have an established business or any of the associated paper trail.  Since this is not starting out as a full time thing for me it’s going to take a while to establish a niche and any kind of consistent revenue. 

This may seem like kind of a simple question but I don’t have much (any)  experience navigating anything like this.

996,personalfinance,"When it comes to paying off credit cards, the most prevalent advice I see is to pay off the card with the highest interest rate first.

...but that doesn't consider each card's overall balance, so I expect that it really depends.  
Here's a hypothetical example of 2 cards:  
Card 1: Higher interest rate, lower balance. Last interest charge was $20.  
Card 2: Lower interest rate, higher balance. Last interest charge was $50.

It seems to me that I should get the Card #2 interest charge down to $20 before I think about paying more on Card #1 – even though Card #1 has a higher interest rate.

After all, the interest charge is ultimately the cost of borrowing money - so it would be wise to focus on reducing that cost. This would be the card with the higher interest ***charge*** \- which is not always the card with the higher interest ***rate***.

999,personalfinance,"My employer is going through an HSA transfer from Optum to Fidelity and we have a 1/30/2023 deadline to liquidate all our Optum investments (convert them into cash) for the transfer to happen. 

I never used any website as bad as Optum:

**1st attempt**: I requested to sell all my investment (I only have one SWPPX fund), but Optum only allows you to request selling using dollar amount, not share units. So two days later when the transaction settled, it turned out (likely due to fund pricing variation) they left about 13 dollars (about 0.3 shares) on my SWPPX balance. This showed as a settled transaction on my history as ""SALE DUE TO FUND TRANSFER "" one day after request.

**2nd attempt**: I then requested to sell that remaining 13 dollars again following the same procedure. This time they showed a transaction history to ""credit 13 dollars into my HSA cash account"", with type ""SELL INVESTMENTS"". But my cash account didn't see any change. Now three (trading) days passed, and nothing happened. I still see the 0.3 shares on my portfolio. I still see no settled transaction for that 13 dollars. AND, the website does not stop me from initiating another request to sell the remaining portfolio either after I tentatively tried to (it used to block me saying there is pending transaction and I needed to wait). It is like the 2nd liquidation order did not go through at all.

Called my employer's HSA management phone number (as instructed by Optum), they have no idea what is going on and all confused. Called Optum, got the usual running around and no one had a clue what they were talking about.

Should I request to liquidate again? I don't even know if my previous (2nd) liquidation request is still being processed or not so I am not certain another liquidation request will complicate the matter, but we are close to the transfer deadline :(

I’m a work from home contractor for a credit bureau. I live in New Mexico, my company is out of state if that matters? I’ve been in this position 1 year 3 months. I get paid $18/hr weekly. Every Thursday/Friday for the past year my check deposit has been exactly $558.64, on every paycheck, literally I have the stubs to prove it. It’s always exactly the same amount because I don’t have a time clock so in my time sheet every week it’s always the exact time I input, 40 hours down to the second. 

Here’s the problem:

Today my deposit was $458.76. I quickly logged onto my workstation and checked my paystub. Nothing has changed. Hourly rate $18/hr still the same. 40 hours worked. My tax withholding for fed and state however have all nearly doubled. For no reason? That’s where my extra $100 went. 

I contacted HR for an explanation and she said “sometimes taxes increase and that’s that.” So essentially I can kiss $400 a month ($5000 yearly) down the drain and now it’ll basically be like I took a pay cut and am working for $14/hr now because reasons?

How can this be?? Am I missing something? I’m no spring chicken and at no place I’ve ever worked at in the past has my take home pay been slashed at the start of the new year for seemingly no reason. 

No liens. No child support. No back taxes owed. No garnishments. Nothing like that at all.

1) buy a starter home and pay off in five years. Pros - I’m very risk averse and don’t want to over leverage, plus this gives mobility. 

2) buy a duplex and rent one side. I’ve have some friends have success with this and my partner is a licensed inspector and has been an individual property manager before. However, I’m very concerned about getting a bad tenant. Also, heaven forbid my partner and I break up and I’m not sure I want to be a landlord. Plus not sure what kind of liability I have here/ what insurance costs are. Fearful of the whole idea tbh. 

3) buy land to begin developing. I want to homestead one day, but my job keeps me in city areas for now. However, I really like the idea of buying something and working towards it as a forever home. Cons are lack of mobility, and I would still be renting.

Today I responded for the first time to let them know I am not interested in any phone call meetings and they should send me an email (or Edward Jones account message).

""This is '----' here at Edward Jones. Just wanted to give you a call here. Received your email and rather than replying to that, I figured I would just give you a quick phone call here. So off of the requirement for your investment program is that we do a once-a-year annual review that can be a short phone call, but it can't be done electronically. So if you can't make that work once a year for a five minute phone call, unfortunately, we'll have to remove you from the investment program and set your investments in cash because this is a fiduciary requirement on a review of that account with you. Hate to be a stickler on this, but it's my license that's on the line. So if you can't be bothered for a five minute phone call, unfortunately, I'm going to move your Investments out of that investment program and put them in cash.

1019,personalfinance,"Hi Reddit, I'm a first time home buyer running into some seriously weird issues with an HOA, and curious about the legality of some of the stunts they're pulling. I'm a veteran using the VA loan. Nothing has closed yet, but things are getting close enough to start worrying. Sorry for the long post, but there's a lot to question.

My partner and I are purchasing a condo unit in Chicago. We have already agreed to a price with the seller, our lender has approved the loan, the appraisal and inspection are both completed as well. When it came time to drop off some money orders to the front office, we started seeing some serious problems.

The building manager was great, up until we handed her the sales contract and the number for money down was still blank. Our lender told us to leave this blank for the time being, just so VA loan stuff could clear and it didn't need to be there until way closer to closing anyway. Here's where the fun starts:

The building manager asked what our ""loan to value"" was rather quickly and we were stumped, because as newbies, we aren't great with a lot of terms. We told her we were doing a VA loan, and she immediately snaps back with, ""oh, so do you have the 20 months of assessment fees available to pay?"" We had absolutely no idea what she was talking about and let her know that. She prints off page 22 and 23 of their 40 page HOA rulebook and shows us a clause buried in there where if you put down 0%, you owe 20 months of assessment fees. She did some quick math to show we would end up owing just shy of what a 10% down payment would look like.

She also included 2 parking spots and cable/internet. The parking spots are on a waitlist and we were like 8 spots down, so she pulled those numbers right out of thin air, and the cable/internet is already on the assessment fee and she listed it again. So I'm feeling like it's pretty obvious she's trying to scare us off.

It doesn't end there. She is also requesting we each file a credit report through a company they use, again, after we've already been through this with our lender/bank and received credit scores from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. I asked if they could just get this from our lender since it's already been done, and I was given a stern no, it has to be through this specific company. They gave us a number, an extension, ask for ""Name"". For what it's worth, both of our credit scores are very good. Certainly more than sufficient for this place.

They have also requested that the next HOA board meeting they have, that we meet them remotely so they can basically ""interview"" us and it sounds like they're going to approve us moving in.

The 20 months of assessment payments WERE provided in the HOA rulebook they gave us, but we didn't receive it at the beginning when we were discussing with the seller. It was also buried in an email with a total of 63 PDFs, only one of which was the rulebook. Everything else was just cover pages, meeting minutes, small potatoes and nothing-pages. No one except the HOA was aware of this 20 month assessment fee. Not us, our realtor, lawyer, lender, the seller, the seller's broker, the seller's lawyer, no one had a clue until we told them the building manager hit us with it and everyone is arguing this fee should have been front and center. Also, none of us (seller's side included) have ever heard of such a clause and we're all in agreement that it sounds absolutely insane.

Our lender told us to basically tell them to kick rocks on having our credit hit again for their report, as this is a pretty bad thing to do during a major purchase. If they want credit scores, they can get them from him if he even deems it necessary.

Our realtor suspects that ""voting in"" people in the building sounds like something a co-op does and doubts this is even legal. Our lawyer is looking into how they got around this being a form of discrimination.

So, I'm wondering if anyone has ever seen anything like this? How can we hack this apart? Is this stuff even legal? Even if we beat these fees, what are the odds the HOA just messes with us the entire time we're there? It isn't too late to back out and cut our losses, but it's getting way too close to let it go.

1035,personalfinance,"I’ve been watching for used cars, and one I like is available for a good price, through a non-dealership store (Carvana). 

I’ve been preapproved for a loan through Carvana, with a decent, but not great interest rate. This was not a hard enquiry and the rate quoted to me was described as a “minimum rate”, meaning once they actually check my numbers it could increase (I have good credit, 740s, but it’s not immaculate). 

I have a checking and savings account through Big Bad American Bank, and there are three credit unions in my town, but no “in” through my employer. I believe they are all open to the public. One of them I know has been here for years, the other two I think are new, I’ve never heard others mention them and they didn’t pop up when I was thinking about this a few years ago. 

So, how do I shop for a loan? I don’t really want to convert my entire (meager) financial portfolio to a different bank, although I know there’s many very good reasons to not bank with whom I currently use. I’m open to moving everything to a credit union, but I don’t know how to choose one - is it simply who offers me the lowest interest rate (assuming other benefits are on par with what I have/expect)?

Then, what is the order of operations for staking a claim on the car, agreeing to a loan, going to the “store” and taking possession? (They can deliver the car to me but I feel weird about buying it sight unseen; store is 1hr away). Does the credit Union issue me a check, or is there some process done at the store with my account number? 

And, what do I need to do ahead of time with my insurance, to be able to drive away with an insured vehicle - my current coverage is nearly minimal, given the age of my old car, so I also will need to upgrade that.

Some background information: In 2020 my then girlfriend (now wife) and I moved to a college town for my PhD program, and rented an apartment which we still live in. Ever since, my in-laws have said we should consider buying a house so we build equity as opposed to paying rent. I have always been averse only because I hadn't yet passed all my requisite exams, any failure would remove me from the program. I have recently passed my last exam, so I'll be continuing until I finish the degree or leave of my own accord. With that, my in-laws have resumed their housing suggestions.

I'm not exactly opposed, but from browsing this sub for a while, I'm hesitant. I know buying is a major investment that would actually cost money if only held in the short term, which I would be expecting. On average students complete my program in 5-6 years, of which I'm in the middle of my third. I don't think this is enough time to build any sort of equity in a home, but can't cite any actual terminology or numbers.

1045,personalfinance,"My husband and I both make good salaries, with a large portion of my annual salary coming in my annual bonus. Usually I use this bonus to get ahead on bills, max out simple IRA, put some money in stocks, and for home improvements. This year, after maxing out my IRA I netted roughly $45k, which I was planning to use for a badly needed renovation. Unfortunately, my HVAC unit also bit the dust this week, which will be $5500 to repair. 

I was already nervous putting all of the money into the kitchen, given it would not leave me with much liquid savings for emergencies, and now with the HVAC expense I don’t think I will have enough to do the kitchen. My kitchen cabinets are falling apart so I really don’t want to wait another year to do the renovation and I want to knock out a wall/change the footprint as part of the renovation, so I kind of need to do it all at once. 

We don’t have any debt aside from my husband and my car notes (and my mortgage), but I have money already set aside to pay those monthly payments for the year. I pay off my credit cards in full every month. Our parents are also well off, so if we were to ever fall on some really hard times they would help us out if needed. 

So with all of this being said, I had an idea that I could open up a new credit card with a 0% intro APR to pay for the HVAC and some of the home renovation cost, pay the minimum balance during the year, and then pay off the card in full with my next annual bonus (which should be around the same amount or more).

Is there any reason this would be a bad idea? I have never not paid my credit cards in full, so using a card like this would definitely be new to me. The only problem I am anticipating is that I may not be able to pay for the home improvement expenses with a credit card, but in this case I would just put more of my regular household expenses on that 0% APR card (and still pay it off at the end of the year).",Should I put home renovation costs on new credit card?,1672952790

Yesterday we went to my local credit union to open a new account, and we decided to try refinancing our 2018 Chevy Cruze that is in both of our names. Our credit scores are 'fair' at around 620. I very recently all but paid off a $1,000 credit card, so likely my score is higher.

Anyways, everything seemed to have checked out. They pulled our credit, and said they need proof of income, insurance cards, registration, etc. I informed the bank that I did not yet file for 2022 yet, so I do not have 2 solid years of self employment income to report yet. They said that's okay, and so after submitting my 2021 and 2020 returns, they told me that my income is not enough to refinance.

In 2020 I believe I made around $20,000 because I still had a W2 job for about 2 months. I also own an LLC that I've operated since 2016 which turns a profit of about $2-$4k a year. Surely my 1099 work yields at least $13,000 or so a year.

But now that I'm looking at my numbers from 2022, it appears as though my 1099 work only yielded about $12k, I'm not positive though considering Shipt deactivated me in March 2022 and I have no access to those earnings until they send me a 1099. I'd estimate that with Shipt I made around $14,000 last year altogether excluding my LLC.

My concern is that I have tried to do 2 years of continuous self employed work because mortgage lenders typically need 2 years of tax returns to determine whether or not I can get a house. I learned this about a year ago, so I was 1 year in and figured I'd keep going with the self employment since I was already halfway there.

Even with my fiance's full time W2 income accounted for and her credit score, they wouldn't even let us refinance a car. Do we have a chance at even getting a mortgage on a cheap $20k-$30k trailer? Or did I essentially waste 2 years of my time? Would our chances of being able to get a home increase once our credit scores go up? As I mentioned earlier my credit card was paid off, but I didn't really give any time for the bureau to update my score, which in hindsight I probably should have.

Common sense tells me that a mortgage should be much different than an auto loan to be approved for, considering mortgages have much longer terms of 15/30 years. We also plan on using our tax refunds to put as a down payment. Perhaps I'm worrying too much? I'm not sure though.

I have $5k in my investments account, and just over $10k in my 401k.

I have a lot of student loan debt ($160k), but I haven’t started paying it off yet due to the COVID forbearance.

I’m in a good spot right now and I’m not sure if I should focus all my efforts in paying off my car loan.  I can get it paid off in 4-5 months.

In May of last year, I opened a zero-interest card from Wells Fargo to pay down my credit card debt. I'm recently graduated and finally have a healthy salary, so I'm trying to improve my financial health.

Having been a longtime lurker in this sub, I want to add for the record - I have never missed a credit card payment, I spend less than I earn, and I don't use this card at all. 

Now, here's the problem: Although I have a balance on my WF card of nearly $5,000 that I'm paying the minimum on each month, the funds were never actually dispersed to the credit card it was intended to pay off. WF has the correct card number and I've spoken to them \*many\* times over the last eight months, and still nothing. They just keep kicking it to a different office. The first time I spoke with them, they told me it would be a three-month investigation process. Eight months later, there's been no resolution -- and they haven't even tried to contact me. 

Today, I spoke with the executive office and they couldn't find a complaint. They did give me a case number long ago, but I didn't have it on me. After some research, they found that my complaint was never escalated to the appropriate office. So, not only have I had an additional $5k in debt on my credit report for the last eight months (which is obviously affecting my credit), they've completely mishandled this issue and I don't even know whether they've done any research or attempted to resolve this issue.

What should I do in this situation? I don't know who to ask because I'm embarrassed that I'm just starting to get my life on track financially at 32 (please be kind!). So I turn to you folks to provide any insight you have. Is it possible to just have WF cancel this debt? Or how should I approach this?

kindly,

My wife and I are purchasing a house for the first time. We have 3 different mortgage options and we're looking for pro/cons on a few of them.

The house we are buying is $295k and we are putting 10% down.

Loan 1: 5.25% 30yr with a balloon payoff at 10yrs. PMI requires 15% Equity (rather than the standard 20%) and they are offering a HELOC to cover the last 5% down payment, so we wouldn't have any PMI.

Loan 2: Same lender as Loan one but is a 6.5% 30yr. PMI requires 15% equity and we can have a HELOC for the last 5% down payment, so no PMI.

Loan 3: 5.875% 30yr mortgage. PMI is est. $150/mth.

&amp;#x200B;

Not taking in account any early payoff / extra principal payments, the total cost of the loan would be:  
Loan 1: $522K  
Loan 2: $594K  
Loan 3: $541K

If we take in account early payoff (and paying the same amount on each loan each month, so once PMI is gone, that amount goes into extra principal payments), the total cost of the loan would be:  
Loan 1: $435K  
Loan 2: $551K  
Loan 3: $450K

Loan 2 clearly isn't the best option (no PMI doesn't offset the interest rate difference).

Loan 1 is the cheapest (lowest interest rate and no PMI) but it comes with the additional risk that if we don't refinance or move, we're stuck paying off the remaining balance in a balloon payment, but we get a low interest rate. Its also the loan that we would pay off the quickest.

Is the balloon loan a bad idea because of the added risk? Other people that have I consulted with have pretty mixed opinions.",Mortgage: Low Interest w/No PMI Balloon?,1672945062

By the end of 2023, I'd like to have $10,000 saved, and pay off at least a 1/4 of my private loans ($82,000 -refinanced with SoFi last year for 6.40%). I know that interest isn't great - Didn't even graduate smh but willing to own my decision for taking on private loans. 

Currently, my 2-week paycheck is $3000 post-tax, with $200 going to my 401K. I just opened an HYSA with SoFi(3.75% return) and will use it to earn interest. My checking account is with Chase, and I'm wondering what a good rule of thumb would be to best divide my paycheck: 

$2800 per paycheck, $5600 a month give or take

\-$1200 rent+utilities(monthly)

\-$1000 Student Loan payment(monthly)

\-$500 miscellaneous(groceries, gym)

1149,personalfinance,"Hi all, forgive my formatting in advance, I am on mobile.
 
I am 22F and have been at my current job out of college for just under a year, was making 50k and just got a raise to 58k. No debt. I live in a 1 br apt with my partner in a HCOL city. He works freelance in the film arena, and his income varies, so I feel the most comfortable making financial choices like housing with the assumption that I can pay everything on just my income, though he is usually able to contribute about 30% of household expenses. He could be doing more, but as my income is more stable, this has been what I have been the most comfortable with until this point.
 
Presently do not have a strict budget but I know I need to work that out. This last year was somewhat of an experiment as my partner quit his job in March to go freelance, and like I said, I did not want to count on his income to pay our bills, but now that we have gotten a clearer picture of his earning capabilities, I feel more comfortable relying on him for his income.
 
At this point my fixed costs are:

- $1,100 rent (Will be moving in July to something around $1600, where I live now is extremely unsafe and this is nonnegotiable).

- $250 car payment
- $100 utilities
- $200 gas
- $33 gym membership
- $760 6 mo car insurance premium that happens to be up for renewal this month (shopped around and unfortunately cannot find anything lower)
 
Whatever is left over I do spend frivolously, but I pay my CCs off in full monthly, though I am ready to sit down and build a budget. I guess I come to you all asking what can I be doing better, and am I super far behind? Any advice for budgeting?

I know the most obvious answer is save as much as possible and build a proper budget. I don’t need to look at the bank statements to know that most of my spending is on takeout, but I am currently learning to cook so that should be steadily falling. I know I absolutely have to decrease my spending to supplement the increase in my housing costs when the time comes. 

I have been feeling bad about my spending because I know it has been careless when my partner is able to contribute 50% to rent, I just blow that money. Again, I have no debt, but I am worried I am behind financially in terms of savings and retirement. 
 
As of now I am investing 10% of my income into a Roth 401k, and 1% into a traditional pretax 401k at the insistence of my parents – my mother feels like she is being screwed by having to pay enormous taxes on her traditional 401 not that she is retired, but I have seen on here that a Roth 401k isn’t always the right choice. 

Honestly, I am a secretary and honestly do not see my income in my lifetime go above 100k, but I am young and who knows where I will end up. No employer 401k match, but I believe after I have been with the company 2 years I receive a contribution at a percentage of my salary. That said, between those two accounts I have currently contributed around $2800. 

I also have an HSA with $2200 in it as of now, and pledged $3600 to that account this year, with a $700 employer contribution. I have about $2600 in a savings account as an emergency fund. 

I know I should open a Roth IRA, but I am not really clear on how that works. My employer 401k is through Vanguard, can I just open the account there, or would it be wiser to open an entirely new account through Charles Schwab? Am I in bad shape currently, and if so, what changes need to be made?

1153,personalfinance,"Hello personalfinanciers! I have always enjoyed the advice and insights from this sub and find myself in a place where I’m finally able to take stock of where I’m at and think a bit more long term about the future. And could really use some advice. 

First, some high level details:

Gross monthly: $8900

Monthly expenses:
-Rent: $767 (live with my partner in a shared home with friends)
-Home savings account: $1,116 (20% of net monthly)
-Utilities: ~$100
-Pension contribution: $575
-Roth IRA: $542 (yearly maximum)
-Car payment: $558 (more on this later)
-Car insurance: $114
-Phone bill: $72
-Vacation savings: $200
-Credit card: $2000*

*I treat my credit card like a debit card. I never carry a balance and always pay off my charges monthly. I group all other monthly expenses onto my credit card spending (like groceries, nights out, gym, shopping, etc). It gives me some peace of mind and flexibility so i’m not being too fastidious on every category. 

Assets:
-Index fund total: ~$15k
-Roth IRA: ~$17k
-Emergency fund: $17k (this covers the  basics like rent, utilities, and car payment for 6 months m)
-Home savings account: $7k
-Vacation account: $4k

Some context: I was finishing a PhD for all of my 20s (before PhD worked a canvassing job that paid shit). During my PhD, I made ~$30k/year. I started to save what I could in my Roth IRA starting in 2017, and managed to pay off all my undergrad student debt (about $38k) over the course of my grad studies (pretty proud of that!) The only debt i now have is my car payment, which I share with my partner. Our total monthly car payment is $810/mo at 2.94% interest. We have an agreement where we both contribute 10% of net pay, or $600/month, whichever is lesser. The rest of those contributions/money get rolled over into a joint savings account to be used for car related expenses. We own an electric vehicle so car maintenance should be low. 

In March of last year, I accepted a job at a state agency in WA where my salary was $80k. In October, a truly dream job opened in local city government doing what I focused my PhD on, and came with a $30k raise and better benefits. So really a win-win-win. Lots of room for advancement and I should max out my current classification in 2 years, which is a 4.5% raise/year. 

I’ve realized that - in part growing up working class and having a pathologically frugal father, and in part being a low-income earning graduate student - I am still living in a kind of “poverty mentality” where I have psychologically caught up to my new salary and spending power. I feel guilty taking vacations or indulging in myself, or like even the simple things like buying cocktails instead of well drinks when i go out every now and then. 

I live in a HCOLA and I would like to buy a house. I think i’m on track to do that in the next 5 years. While my partner and i aren’t married, I imagine we might be in the next few years (I can’t imagine life without him at this point). We don’t plan to have kids. 

How should I be shuffling my budget around? What should I do with my yearly raises? Promotions (very likely)? What should be some of my medium and long term goals?

1154,personalfinance,"TLDR at the bottom. 

I opened a new credit card to take advantage of a balance transfer promotion last year. I did 2 separate balance transfers, 1 at 0% interest and another at 6% interest (which was way better than the 26% I had been paying). I have been paying over 1k per month on a $180 minimum payment to get this paid off by the end of the promotional period. The 0% interest period ends 3/23 and the 6% interest period ends 10/23. 

What I just found out is that my payment does not apply to the transfer with the first promotional end date. It applies to the higher interest first. There is no way that I can make a payment directly to a balance transfer and I do not have the total remaining at this time to pay off. It is only 8k but unfortunately I just don't have it right now and won't have it before March. 

I would really like to avoid paying the 26% interest that is going to hit on that balance. I have great credit and am considering taking a low interest personal loan to pay that off and avoid high interest but my husband does not think this is a good idea to open another line of credit for that debt. 

We just bought a house and won't need a new car for over a year so I am not incredibly concerned about this affecting future large purchases or overall credit score. 

So, what is the best option for me here, taking the interest hit or trying to pay out the total balance with a new line of credit and taking on a lower interest for the total amount? Any advice on what I should consider is appreciated. 

TLDR: I misunderstood how balance transfer payments were working and am about to get hit with 26% interest on 3k.

* 2021: Higher bonuses and low 401k contributions, resulted in a $140k AGI (my salary then was $123k) so only a partial contribution was available to me. I filed only recently (so very late) for the excess contribution so that's a hard pill to sallow for the 6% penalty but I'll be learning for that mistake
* 2022: New job with exactly $125k salary and maxed out 401k, so I'm hopefully anticipating my AGI would be lower that I could have contributed the full ROTH (question on this line of thinking below) but I will possibly have to recharacterize or withdraw
* 2023: Contributed a small chuck to my ROTH IRA already
* ROTH IRA Backdoor was not used in any of these situations

Hopefully the above points makes sense essentially, I am in the partial contribution range and will need to be more careful about how I contribute to my ROTH IRA. Some questions I have are:

* Am I thinking about my AGI correctly in that contributions to my 401k should help reduce my AGI so I could be eligible for the $6k ROTH IRA contribution (not counting the backdoor method)?
   * If so, should I wait for my W2 to start calculating my AGI?
* Lastly, with the portion I already contributed to my ROTH IRA for 2023, should I just go ahead and recharacterize that all to a Traditional IRA (I haven't purchased stocks) and go for a ROTH IRA backdoor from now on?

Any other thoughts on my situation are greatly appreciated. I'm pretty disappointed in myself for the negligence I had in managing my ROTH IRA account but am will to learn to my mistake and hopefully be better in the future.

1183,personalfinance,"I max out my Roth IRA (via Backdoor) and 401k (Traditional) every year. I used to work for a company where after-tax contributions were not allowed, so I stowed away some extra saved money in a regular taxable brokerage with Fidelity. I put in about $20,000, though with market conditions this account is now worth about $16,500.

My new employer does allow for after-tax 401k contributions and although I probably won't have a ton of extra money, I'd like to take advantage of any tax benefits I can. 

My thought is to sell my entire brokerage account, harvest the loss on taxes, then ""live off"" the $16,500 for the next few months while putting almost my entire paycheck into my 401k through traditional (as normal) and then after-tax with the in-plan conversion to Roth. I'd do this for a few months until I had about that $16-20K in the Roth portion.

Since I'm basically a long term set-and-forget investor, something feels bad about selling stock at a loss that I know would recover, but if I'm not taking it as cash and re-investing into similar holdings (total market index funds) I guess it's all the same.

* Is this a good plan? Any unexpected complications to be aware of? 
* Would wash sale rules apply? If I sold out the brokerage account would I need to wait to buy in through a different account with different rules? 

I also have a kiddo and a 529, I could just move the $16,500 directly into there. I wasn't planning on front-loading his college fund like this, but it would be a simpler way of making sure that currently taxable money ends up being non-taxable after growth, while still capturing some losses this year. I could shift his future college contributions to other vehicles later if we load him up now.

1185,personalfinance,"My wife and I have received an inheritance that I think should set us up for life if we manage it correctly. Not life changing just comfort.

We received about 800k in assets, we've liquidated risky investments and are confident in our decisions in this department. We now have about 400k of investable liquid money and in a few years will have another 200k of investable money once we sell a house that currently has a tenant in it after they move out.

I'm 39 and my wife is 35, I'm maxing my 401k contributions at work to what they match. We have NOT done any roth IRA investing which I know is a mistake but we're able and willing to get on the right path now.

After meeting with an advisor at our bank, he didn't mention roth IRA at all and said they would create a mutual fund and manage it. This is done for a 1.1% fee which I have no way of coming to the real number myself but in my head a red flag went off that I might be paying too much to have this managed. The other thing is that i've read time and time again that rather than do a mutual fund, maybe I should just dump it in S&amp;P or some comparable index fund as no mutual fund would outperform it. The advisor says the benefit of the mutual fund is that they can stop the bleeding when the market is in a downward trend by moving assets around.

I don't know what to make of this and maybe I could get a consensus from you guys on what to do.

1187,personalfinance,"Hi all,

I had a small 30 day missed payment on an account about a year ago (death in the family at the time it was suppsoed to be paid/thought it was on autopay), and decided to just take a long shot and write a goodwill letter and just see if it could get removed. I know the odds of it being granted was low, but figured it doesn't hurt.

Apparently, I was wrong? I saw my score tanked about 25 points and when I looked at the updates, it had the note ""Consuner disputes this account Information - Account previously in dispute now resolved by data furnisher"". At first I thought this was a promising remark, but given the reflected change in credit score, and the fact that the missed payment is still there, I'm thinking it's not. 

It seems there was some kind of misunderstanding, since I wasn't trying to dispute (and from my understanding- goodwill letters aren't a formal dispute). I made it pretty clear in my letter I was accepting the balance as my own, and the reasoning for the missed payment. Is this normal? Should I contact the credit bureau/ creditor and explain it wasn't a formal dispute and just s good will letter? Or is this just part of the process with good will letters?

The only other changes on my credit report were just balance decreases, so I can't imagine the decline in score was related to anything else.

1188,personalfinance,"So I'm usually pretty good with my finances or at least lately I have been trying to get a hold of how much money I am spending and being mindful of every dollar I have spent. Two years ago I had some mental health issues and for whatever reason I signed up for untold amounts of subscription based services during this time and stopped monitoring my spending. I usually put everything on my credit cards and at some point my credit card was put on lockdown by the credit card company because apparently the auto payments I had setup were bouncing back. So many of the recurring bills weren't going through. I had no idea or at least I wasn't paying attention.

Anyways over the last six months I paid off those cards, and started noticing all these bills from a ton of companies hitting the card. I did my best to go through my credit card activity, identify, and cancel all the recurring transactions I didn't need, because all those recurring bills started to hit my card once it was unlocked. There was probably 15+ recurring subscriptions that were hitting my card. A few I have literally not been able to locate the sign in info for the accounts I used to purchase the subs and I have been having to call the companies and spend hours on the phone while they attempt to locate the account that's billing my card. Some of them I can't even get a hold of a customer service representative to do that so I'm paying for something I have no idea how I signed up for it.

For the most part I have quelled the fire. However what I'm now dealing with is that I apparently signed up for stuff that is on annual billing cycles and just when I think I've gotten a hold on it something pops up every month. I am losing my mind with this I have no idea how I signed up for so much. I know part of it is I probably signed up for trials out of boredom and then they are just billing me annually, but it scares me because some of the stuff is like $100-200/yr.

1215,personalfinance,"hi I'm sorry if this is a stupid question. this is my first time doing my taxes and i just wanted to see if anyone could help at all or even check my work. it would be greatly appreciated, i am also hiring someone to do my taxes, but i was just curious if i could also calculate it myself.

i made around $2,500 from a w-2 job, which i will obviously get a form for later. but most of my income was from self-employment in which i made around $19,583 this year from. i do not think i will even get taxed additionally from my w-2 job because i did not make enough in that job. 

this is the current math:

* As of right now, 19,583.50x0.9235= 18,085.36 is self-employment taxable income (without deductions and expenses)
   * Self employment tax rate: 18,085x0.153= 2,767.06
* As of right now, I made a net of less than 2,500, so earned income is less than standard deduction (approximately 12,000)
   * Will not likely owe anything on this &gt; do not have to file a tax return (????)

I want to get it right (or close) by adjusting in January.  I'm defining ""getting it right"" by being within $1,000 owed or returned. For 2022 I think we're close, but I had to adjust my taxes in September to take out an extra $1,000/month from the remainder of the year, and we'll see if I'm right in a month or so when I do my taxes.

First, thank you in advance for all the generous and thoughtful responses.

I am 25 years old and currently a student with no source of income. My school disallows students from working their first semester of school. Though, I can work starting this semester. 

I have  about $18k in credit card debt from four cards. All cards have interest rates around 20%. These cards were taken out in 2019 to assist family during an extremely distressing time. I have made every minimum payment excluding December 2022 where I ran out of money due to law school living expenses. 

Also, I have and will continue to incur student loan debt for law school expenses. I estimate to have around $180k in law school debt by the time I graduate in 2025. I have no undergraduate debt or car loan debt. 

I am currently a law student at a T-14 school where I am supporting myself through grants given by the law school and federal student loans. I comfortably took out the loans knowing that top law school graduates, with hard work and perseverance, can attain jobs at private law firms making around $200k their first year. My long term career plan is to 
work at a big law firm to pay off debt and then return to my home state to serve as a public defender. 

I would need to earn $1,000-$1,500 a month to meet the monthly payments and my immediate reaction is just to get a job but am wondering if …

Instead of working a part-time job in law school and losing time toward professor relationship development, independent research, and networking —should I declare bankruptcy now? 

If I work a part-time job, I won’t have time to join a journal, be involved in affinity groups, participate in moot court AND still make time to study diligently to get the best grades possible to maximize my employment outcomes.  

How would bankruptcy affect future employment in law firms and the government?

The car payment doesn’t matter to me that much as I see it being something I’ll always have in life , I simply enjoy cars too much to ever keep one for more than 4-5 years. I understand that is considered heresy in this subreddit lol. In addition I’m still at my first job so I assume my salary still has room to grow at least since I’m in the tech field.

1264,personalfinance,"Hello everyone quick question, 

I have been a bit in a tight spot financially so I requested to do a partial payment on 
My car bill this month. It requires me to pay a portion up front and the remainder next month. 
A few days ago the partial payment was pulled from my bank account. Yesterday 1/4/2023 the same establishment charged me AGAIN, however for the full monthly car payment. 
I called the car financing agency and they told me to have my bank stop the pending payment which I did as of noon 1/4/2023. 

I work overnight and pulled up my bank account to see if my balance was back to normal and it’s definitely not. I have a lot of transactions missing and I’m now in the negative. I’m assuming that it’s still processing the changes?

1265,personalfinance,"I have a 2018 Hyundai Elantra with 25000 miles on it. I bought it new and I'm just 6 months away from paying it off. I was planning to keep this car for another 5 years but after a break-in last week I found out that this model doesn't have an immobilizer and is very easily stolen. I was very lucky that the thieves were scared off by my neighbor and left the scene after breaking a window. I got a steering wheel lock to deter future thieves but I am still concerned about more break-ins and higher insurance premiums and lower resale value. Having to put a steering wheel lock every time I park is not fun either.

I was checking KBB and CarMax and seems like I might be able to get $14000 to $15000 If I sell this car then I would have to buy another one (maybe a Corolla or Civic, for $22000 to $27000 depending on trim) and I know that the prices for used and new cars are high right now.

Mechanically speaking this car is pretty reliable and I don't really need a new car right now.

Right now I'm living paycheck to paycheck until I manage to get over the hump of late Rent payments once I'm steadily working. I had a job at Amazon from Aug up until Nov before I resigned. I had taken a 1.5 month LOA for Mental Health reasons which led to manic spending, constant buying of food/drinks via Postmates, and loss of payments from SDI because my Dr. Said they weren't in the system and we didn't have all the right records and paperwork since I had contacted her way too late into the LOA. So I lost around $2500 of income due to that. Once I came back to work I ended up feeling physically incapable and mentally incapable of continuing working there with all this money due here and there looming over me, losing money to Ubers to work since it was far away from me, and just not feeling the right support from coworkers saying I'm just trying to not work and all that despite all my issues, mental, physical, or otherwise. I was physically hurting myself everyday at work to the point of near incapacitation once home. It was just like stress overload.

So during all this I ended up forgoing any payments to credit accounts due to either being too broke or focusing solely on rent and borrowed money from friends/family. I had a chronic spending problem putting most of my credit towards my gaming PC and its upgrades, a gaming laptop, a new phone, another new phone, a new E-Bike i never used because in my area none of the apps support it for delivery purposes and because of that mental health problem and low physical health I never got around to using it for any reason (I'm now selling it), lots of foods, snacks, drinks, and just anything that kept me any form of entertainment. Everything piled up, late fees, interest, etc. Until it was too much for me.

I've thought of Bankruptcy but I'm not entirely sure how to go through that and what it entails. I'm in CA if that makes any difference. I'm now working at Walmart as mentioned making $17/hr and just recently on Dec 17 and on Dec 23 contracted COVID from work and had to take a COVID Leave which I'm just now getting off of and can return to work on the 6th according to my doctor. I got paid for 4 scheduled work days + 4 days of COVID which amounted to around $950 after taxes and some of that went to automatic payments towards my Moneylion Loan, MoneyLion Instacash Advance, and some other Advance Apps as well as a Dr Appointment, Uber rides, and some light groceries leaving me with around $600. And I currently owe $750 Rent for Dec + $100 Utilities, $75 Late Fee, $750 Rent for Jan, and upcoming receipt of my Utilities due on the 15th. 

Thankfully I worked with my landlord and can pay them when I get my next paycheck in 2 weeks which should hopefully be a lot bigger this time around since it will include some of my COVID Pay and more work days. However I've also looked at Rental Assistance in the off chance I can get assistance for coverage instead of deleting my entire paycheck in one go just to live here.

So what now? How do I go about repairing my situation and raising my score? I uses to have a 760-780 score back when I was /r/churning and didn't even have a job at the time and ended up with super high limit cards with Amex. Though they ended up lowering them severely when I put them under a payment plan and they never reverted it once I canceled the payment plan. If I had all 3 cards at full credit I could have basically put all my other debt combined into just those 3 cards and even my main Chase card before they cut that limit too.

However, the builder’s incentive was pretty good imo so we decided to pull the trigger. It’s a 2023 new built in a location that we like to be in. 30 yrs fixed @ 4.99%, they give us $13,000 to pay for closing cost (which should cover all of it);  appliances also included for free (approx. $5000 in value). With that said, our out-of-pocket is expected to only be the 5% down payment.

I estimated to have around $140k in equity in my current house (calculated by subtracting what I owe versus what Zillow estimates). My realtor said that we could get $2000/ month by renting it out, which would net us $600 cash flow monthly. Our new mortgage plus monthly expenses (less the rent income) would eat up 95% of our combined take home.

* From Vanguard, do I  recharacterize the contribution or simply remove it?
* Is the 6% per year tax penalty based on when the excess contribution was made or at the start of the calendar year?
* Do I have to do the net income calculation for returned or recharacterized IRA contributions? I read on greenbushfinancial that I don't but I'm not sure how reputable that is since the calculation is cited across many excess contribution references.
   * greenbushfinanicial quote: ""If you remove the excess contribution AFTER the tax deadline, you do not have to pay taxes or penalties on the EARNINGS portion because you are not required to distribute the earnings, but you pay a flat 6% penalty per year based on the actual excess contribution amount.""

1316,personalfinance,"Preface: I know next to nothing about cars.

Our 2012 Subaru Forest unfortunately has blown a head gasket. This is the second used car in three years to need a new engine. This time around, the warranty/service contract was sooo close to covering the fix, but I would be responsible for the $2,000 engine tear down to even confirm that it is something covered under the warranty. If it ended up being covered- great but, that's still $2,000 more I'm in the hole as opposed to $3,000 to just get it fixed out of pocket.

So, we're looking at trading toward something else. I've never bought a new car before, and I'm pretty tired of being burned by used purchases.

Is it foolish for a financially struggling person to buy a new car? I've always felt like new car = luxury item, but having learned of the 100% warranty coverage I'm considering this option for the first time.

 I understand as long as you keep up with the service schedule, every single thing you could think of (except windshield damage, wrecks, and external factors) would be covered and paid for by the warranty for the first 5 years at which point it switches  to a 3rd party lifetime warranty.

 I cannot handle finding myself in this situation again in a year or two years.

The payment's looking like $400 more a month than I'm currently paying which, if I follow my budget, should result in still saving (but considerably less per month). I still owe about $6,000 on the Subaru, so couple that with the need of a new engine, and you can see how trading it in gets me peanuts for it.

Between my last two used car purchases, I've honestly spent enough on service and repairs for a pretty sizable down payment on something new.

And of course, if I go this route, expenses are going to have to cut waaaay back.

It's not really a question of **can I do it**, more so - is it a smart move in the long run?

This morning, I paid off all of my delinquent credit (nine delinquent accounts). I kept careful records while paying them off and got receipts in case they do not fall off my report as they should. 

The only things remaining on my credit report are a student loan with a balance of $13,000 (all payments on time and up to date) and an AcceptanceNow loan on a laptop that I bought last year that still has about $900 left to pay off (all payments on time and up to date). 

I currently make $50,000 a year and am paid weekly. My take home pay after insurance, 401k, HSA, and federal tax (no state tax in this state) deductions is about $786.00 per week. We get a fluctuating profit-share bonus around the 15th of each month (usually between $100 and $400). My job and company are very stable and I intend to stay indefinitely. I just received a $5/hr raise to $25/hr and have been told to expect another ""significant"" (no idea) raise later this year (Decemberish).

I live at home with my parents and am paying $350 a week in a combination of rent and other miscellaneous bills. Every other week, I pay AcceptanceNow $186. My parents currently pay my student loan ($160 per month) and have stated that I don't need to worry about paying it until my finances are in order again.

Me and my friend have both lived at home all of college and are ready to move out. What I’m trying to figure out now is if it’s better to rent a place for a year or two or live at home for a few more months and try to save the 3.5% down payment and closing costs for an FHA loan, while leaving some money for an emergency fund. I know rates are crazy right now and aren’t likely to come down for a bit, but is owning a home and building equity a better decision than renting? I feel like a mortgage is roughly the same as rent these days, property taxes are the only thing that worries me. 

I bought my car in cash and my only payments are for my phone and student loans (27k total, 19k being federal loans around 2-4%). At the moment, I have around 5k in cash and 17k invested in retirement accounts. My goal for the next few months is to build up my cash savings and then move out. 

Note: either decision would be splitting rent/mortgage with roommate (1 atm but that could change)

Are there any glaring things I’m failing to consider?

I have a Rollover IRA from a previous employer, the account was initially setup as a Traditional 401k, it is not of significant value. I made my 6k contributions in 2022 bringing it to under 15k. My mistake being that I assumed an IRA was an IRA, when in fact I believe I should have put my 6k last year into a Roth IRA. This year I will be getting married and our combined income will be over the \~250k Roth contribution limit.

If I understand this correctly, I can continue to contribute to my Rollover IRA, but I am now not able to setup and contribute to a Roth IRA due to combined income?

I am aware of, but somewhat unclear on the backdoor option, and not sure if it’s something I should pursue? I could convert my Rollover to a Roth, but that will come at a significant tax cost given our combined income? Could I alternatively add the 6.5k to my Rollover and then covert that to a Roth IRA without a tax hit? Should I avoid all that and just keep submitting to my Rollover? Is there any point in opening up a traditional IRA and submitting to that instead of the rollover?

I have until next week to appeal but I guess my question is should those winnings still count towards my overall income even though I actually lost money on gambling and didn’t take any profits?

Then today an insurance agency I spoke with last week who I didn't hear back from finally emailed me with slightly lower quotes from Farmers and Nationwide. Now I've been reading LOTS of negative reviews on Progressive especially on how they handle repairs or following through with claims. So here are my 3 questions...

1. Would switching over to **Farmers** or **Nationwide** when I just switched to Progressive have any negative consequences to my premium? Keep in mind this would mean I'd be jumping carriers twice in one week. There wouldn't be a gap in coverage as I would purchase the new policy before canceling.   

2. Is Progressive as bad as everyone says? And if so, would the move to Farmers or Nationwide provide me with a better company to depend on for claims involving repairs and hopefully never, a total loss valuation?
3. Am I better off just sticking with Progressive for the remainder of the term (6 months) and switching when it's closer to renewal? FYI, the 6 month term was paid in full to Progressive yesterday so I'd have to wait for a refund if I cancel.

I can understand why banks have this, and I understand that this may be seen as a benefit for some (maybe even most) people; but, I personally hate it.

Do other banks have this issue, or is this just Chase? Is there a bank that I can sign up with that will prevent merchants from charging against a cancelled debit or credit card?

If all other banks suffer from this issue, what options do we have for cutting off subscription services that are difficult to cancel?

I just turned 26 some months ago and have gone through roughly 3 years of irresponsible spending due to getting my first higher paying job, me being me, the COVID pandemic, and depression which I am now getting treated. 

This past 2022 was the 3rd, and I want it to be the final, year that I completely wipe out my bank account at the end of the year due to poor planning. I'm tired of it and really want to start buckling down. Even though I'm 26, I feel like I'm 22/23 financially if that makes sense lol.

My weekly take home pay is 868.37 which is 3475.48 monthly

I currently pay 700 in rent. I have a really awesome housemate who makes quite a bit more than me and decided to split the rent fairly as opposed to evenly, which I really appreciate. I do live in California, so rent is definitely on the high side, and I'm not banking on living with my housemate forever. We both gotta live our lives, even if it requires moving out, which is also a motivator for getting my shit together.

I try to save 500 monthly, and I was doing a pretty good job last year until depression really hit, and I just wrecked everything so I'm starting from nearly 0.

As far as payments go, I've been tackling CC debt which is around 7K and expect to have it paid off by the end of the year. I have 35.5K in student loans and while I qualify for Biden's forgiveness program, I'm absolutely not banking on that since it seems unlikely it will happen. I'm not focusing on putting money into that and instead I want to use the remainder of the payment pause to clear as many CCs as possible.

The rest of my monthly payments including utilities and subscriptions total around 400 - 500. I'm currently rounding up all subscriptions and closing any I don't need and switching the ones I can to yearly payments since they're cheaper and eliminate annoying monthly payments. 

My goal for this year is to pay off all my CC debt while figuring out how to save money and where to put it which is what I mainly need help with. I mostly have the CC repayment figured out. 

I have 4 CCs  with significantly lower balances, so I'm starting off with a snowball method and once those are done (I actually already have two paid off!) I will switch to avalanche for the rest, since they're pretty much maxed out or close to being maxed out. 

As far as saving money goes. My plan was to continue saving 500 per month during the snowball period, making weekly payments to the CC I choose to pay, with any remaining money at the end of the week going into said CC to pay it off faster. Once the avalanche period starts I plan on switching and putting 500 a month into the card I'm paying off as opposed to my savings with any remaining money at the end of the week going into my savings as to not neglect that. 

The issue with my savings is that I want to be able to put some of my them/ invest them into something meaningful that would actually benefit me in the long run even up to retirement age while also keeping part of my savings on deck like in a basic savings account in the event that I need to pay for a sudden large expense (like if my car breaks down). My employer does offer a 401K but the only issue is that I think at the moment I would prefer to get as much take home pay as possible to wrestle down my debt, and have more control over how much money goes where as opposed to having the money somewhere I can't necessarily touch it. If there are any alternatives, I would appreciate any advice. I'm not sure if my best bet would be to just keep putting my savings in a basic account with my bank while tackling my debt and finding a way to invest it once I have more breathing room.","Advice for 26yr old that is finally starting to buckle down financially?

A bank I am working with for a mortgage said my credit came back as 710, which is completely out of the blue. The difference in credit scores means a 0.25% higher interest rate on the loan.

Is it possible that my credit scores as provided by the above sources are all wildly inaccurate and my score is actually 60 points lower than it has been for years? 

Alternatively, is it possible the bank is feeding me a wrong number to bump up the interest rate? I highly doubt that, since this is a regional but still large and established bank, but the thought crossed my mind.

1424,personalfinance,"A few years ago I got scammed into a PACE loan for a home improvement project (energy efficient attic insulation thingy). I had just bought my house and was a first-time homeowner and didn't know any better. The guy who sold me on it did some very nice sleight-of-hand where he would point out the low 2.99% interest rate on the PACE loan and the fact that it would be paid off through my yearly property tax bill, while never mentioning that with all the fees and additional costs they charge, the *effective* interest rate was closer to 11%. When I recently went back through the paperwork and saw that I really kicked myself for going ahead with it. 

But apart from the actual loan amount that I owe (about $8500 left to pay) this loan has cost me probably tens of thousands of dollars indirectly. Back when interest rates were at their lowest, I wanted to refinance to save myself some money but had forgotten about this loan. Turns out I got several offers for a full 1.5% reduction in my fixed interest rate on my mortgage (dropping down from 3.99 to 2.49). But everyone told me they couldn't do it as soon as they discovered I had a PACE loan, which turns out counts as a lien on the property. That really whistled my pickle.

Another super annoying thing that happened: last year the dumbasses doing escrow review at my lender fucked up and did not calculate the amount for the loan that was in my property tax bill. So what happened *this* year? Right, a big escrow shortage resulting in a $400 per month increase in my mortgage for the rest of 2023 to make up for it. I know it'll settle down next year probably but that still pisses me off.


So I want to pay off this loan and saw that they take credit card payments (with no additional fee). I did some churning a while back so the question that immediately popped into my head was, ""Why can't I just apply for new card that has a 0% introductory APR for, say, 15 months (those are a dime a dozen) and pay it off with that? Heck, I'm seeing a lot of these cards have $200 to $400 welcome bonuses, no annual fees, and some of the better ones are 2x points on all purchases with no limit. I can just divide the balance by 15 and pay that amount monthly to pay off the loan interest free. I do not anticipate I'll have any issues making the payments.

While this seems like a no-brainer to me, my question is: is there anything that might prevent me from doing this? I'm thinking for example of something like there being limitations on what kind of credit card purchases qualify for a 0% APR on the new card. I've never heard of anything like that but I want to make sure my plan has no holes in it. I don't want to be opening a new card for no reason.

I will be owed back compensation from the VA if I win my appeal.

Given how quickly my ability to care for myself is going downhill, I have started looking into in-home assistive care.   


I don't have enough assets to normally even think about a trust, but the trust seems like a good idea. The trust can pay for my care while I am alive and then have the kids inherit anything in the trust when I pass.

Plan would be to take the loans and deposit into HELOC. I'd then withdraw monthly from the HELOC to pay back the 401(k) loans + 4.5% (required interest rate from Fidelity). The HELOC is in a period where only interest payments are required, so any ""extra"" that I pay knocks down the principal upon which interest is calculated but is also available to withdraw (essentially a savings account of sorts). I wouldn't max the loans, but something like $40k each from both our 401(k). Rough calculation indicates this would save \~$6,500 in interest this year.

We're not in any financial distress and able to max all the tax benefit accounts, just want to save some money. I understand the potential for lost appreciation on the withdrawn funds in my 401(k), but in reality I'm guaranteed at least 4.5% and I'm not particularly bullish on the market this upcoming year so also view this as a way to ""kind of"" make additional contributions to my retirement plan.

1438,personalfinance,"Greetings!

I live in the US, and feel I am facing a dilemma. I know this is a question many have asked in some form or another, but basically I am worried my older car could break down/become prohibitively expensive sometime in the next few years. Here are the details:

I own a 2013 Chevy Equinox with just over 150,000 miles on it. I own the car in full, no loans on the vehicle. Besides regular maintenance (oil changes, tires, etc) the only major expense I have incurred so far was the alternator failing last year. So I am currently averaging about $700-800/year in vehicle upkeep, plus $1500-2000/year on gas.

Looking at used cars, I cannot find many Equinoxes with more mileage than mine. That has me worried that I am nearing the end-of-life stage of the vehicle. With that in mind, is it worth it to trade it in soon for a new car? 

I would be trying to get a Bolt EUV. If I can avoid dealer markups it would be a $30k car, $5k down payment, and I would guess $5k trade in based on the used pricing being $8-12k for cars similar to mine. The IRS says the 2023 EUV qualifies for the current EV tax credit of $7500, so by next tax season end I would get back my down payment + sales tax, and I would have a car I know will last at least 5-10 years reliably.

Summary of costs:

Current Equinox - $2800/year, could spike in price
 
Bolt EUV - ~$5000/year loan, &lt;$500/year operating costs","Trade-in vehicle while it still has value, or wait and risk vehicle death at unknown time?",1672867255

My gross income is $35,763 annually and my net is $29,097. 

I currently pay 5% towards my 401k and my company's match is as follows ""The company matches $0.20 to your account for every $1.00 you contribute, up to the first 5.00% of your eligible compensation.""

1486,personalfinance,"Would you sell an investment at a loss to pay off high interest debt (16+%)?

I have an investment (not tax advantaged or a retirement account) that I bought before I had any debt, and I could liquidate it today (at a loss) and pay off the debt instantly. Or, I could keep the investment, and cash-flow the debt for a few years (having optimized for budget and spending already), but my calculations show that the interest expense to do so would be nearly identical to the realized loss I'd see by selling today. 

So while I'd get the ""immediate guaranteed return"" equal to the debt's interest rate, I'd also be realizing a loss, so does that in effect make it a wash? Not really sure how to frame that in my thinking, or if it's even relevant. I suppose I would get to write-off that loss on my taxes for the next couple years. 

Generally, this investment isn't something ""that fits my thesis"" anymore either (as the smart folks would say), that is to say, I wouldn't buy it today given what I know, though I believed in it when I did. It could of course go up, liquidating it could be a lost opportunity, or dumping it now could prevent me from realizing a total loss.  Without a crystal ball, I guess I have to decide that for myself. 

To close, I've avoided saying what the investment was since this is a ""personal finance"" subreddit and not ""cryptocurrency"" but this particular investment is Ethereum and while it may go back up, it could also tank once the SEC decides it's a security, plus I'm kinda disgusted by both the fraudulent scam ""alt coins"" that it's helped spawn as well as the direction it's headed having switched to proof of stake. but that's a conversation for a different sub.

Questions I’d love some insight on…

**Buying a house / What to do with our cash**

We were holding onto the cash in the hopes of buying a house soon, like asap. I even lowered my 401k contribution to get more cash in the last few months. However, any decent house in the area is 1.2m+ and the 110k cash we have saved is just not enough. Even with the housing prices coming down, due to the high interest rates, buying a house doesn’t seem like a possibility any time soon. 

So the question is, should we continue to hold onto our cash but put it into HYSA so we can guarantee usage in a year or two? Or give up on the idea of house and put most of it into the market considering the market is low now? I’m not necessarily trying to time the market, we’d likely end up DCAing it over a few weeks. I’ve reset my 401k contributions to max as of 1/1/2023.

The issues — it's very difficult to know what college will actually cost in 18-25 years, and that alone makes me unsure enough to not depend only on grandparent contributions.

* 0.13% of account balance per year deducted quarterly for advisor fee
* Additional fees from within investment funds

Whereas John Hancock would be just shy of 1% - which varies based on investment options.

Honestly, this all confuses me beyond belief and a financial advisor giving me this info only confused me more.

For reference I'm 24M and got married in 2022. This review covers my income and spending this year, along with my thoughts on what I did wrong and can improve on. It is excluding my wife who spends about the same as me but makes 20% more than me. This is a long post, in hindsight I'm not sure how popular it will be, but I enjoyed writing it and I think it helps me to see it written out and motivates me to be better. Hopefully it can help others as well.

Breakdown of the linked pic:

* Total income: $96k
* Total taxes: $11k (doesnt include any returns)
* Net income: $84k
* Total Spending: $62k
* Net Income - Spending: $22k

Note: the monthly income is high in mid summer as I started a new job but stayed with my old job for a couple months. I am thinking of going back part time this coming summer to increase my income again. 

This year was a big year for me, some purchases include:

* $15k for half my wedding/honeymoon
* $5k down payment on a new car
* $3k on office supplies for my wife and I's new WFH job
* $20k or $1700/month for half the mortgage, utilities, car payment and insurance

Note: This may explain my high spending, but I am worried about the other $20k on misc that I haven't tracked (mostly amazon, traveling, and food) is very high and may increase. Hopefully 2023 has less large purchases and can shift an additional $20k into savings/investments. Other than knowing my big purchases and investing 20% automatically I have no actual budget. 

&amp;#x200B;

||Year Starting|Year Ending|Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Savings (Cash)|$13,296|$12,295|$(1,002)|
|Retirement/Brokerage|$6,442|$30,420|$23,978|
|Debt (Student loan/Car)|$(19,689)|$(39,430)|$(19741)|
|Net worth|$49|$3284|$3235|

&amp;#x200B;

Note: This graph above shows a breakdown of my cash, retirement, and debt to gather my net worth. As my first year working full time I'm happy to increase my net worth, but given how much I made a total increase of $3235 or just 4% of my take home pay seems really low. On the flip side my cash/retirement increased almost $23k in one year. Which is more than 20% of my income, so I am happy with that.

Goals for 2023:

* Cut spending by 30% down to $42k (is this still too high for my age/income?)
* Increase Savings/Emergency fund to $20k
* 40% of my income into my retirement accounts
* Increase salary - Get promoted, could be difficult as I'm only 6 months in.
* 3 one week destination vacations

Notes: I feel like I'm setting tough goals for myself, but realistically achievable if I keep with it. I aspire to FIRE and want to be better. I believe if I push myself enough I can get promoted this year, but I only have 6 months of experience and no degree (I'm in finance), so this may be an unachievable goal. The last goal is a reminder that I don't want to be all work and no play. My vacations don't have to be expensive, but I want to set the goal and time to get out of the house and relax. 

Overall I'm new to having money, I always thought I was good at saving. But it turns out I'm really good at spending.

What do you all think? Is my spending insane? Should I set a real detailed budget, if so any recommendations on resources to help? Is dropping by 30% even enough? Let me know if you have any pointers, advice, or comments.","2022 Income and Spending Review, Am I spending too much?",1672857069

I have two checking and a HYSA. My HYSA has about 66% of my savings for growing and not touching. One checking is my debit card/direct deposit, transferred to the HYSA/Bills and the other is just a account where the other 33% of my savings is in case of immediate need.

In my head, I wanted to have the 33% available in case if I needed it immediately - not that I would need it ALL at once though.. the other half is just a weird fear that if my HYSA got hacked or is gone I would still have interim money for expenses. My HYSA is Barclays, so I think that fear is largely irrational..

1535,personalfinance,"Hello! Just as a pre-requisite, I lurk here and have done searches, but I have some anxieties about upcoming life changes that I'd like some thoughts about.

I accepted a job back in August that requires me to move to the greater Seattle area. They gave me plenty of time to move, and I'll be moving soon.

I currently enjoy MCOL-LCOL, and even here I have chosen to spend a little more to get a good social/walkable apartment location . ~$1800/mo 1 bed.


As for finances (the important part):

I'm 23, single, dog owner, no student loans, no debt (minus car payment)

My base salary is ~160k, bonus eligible (usually 10-20% per year) + yearly RSUs (~$30k/yr)
I should note that my compensation was decided on the fact that I will be moving to Seattle, so nothing will change. If I chose to stay it would have been less.

I'm currently maxing 401k, HSA, and my company's Stock Purchase Plan.


I use YNAB so my view into my spending/bills is pretty easy.

My monthly take home after taxes/contributions is ~$7k.

I pay $1100/mo for my car (including insurance/gas)
I have no credit card debt, student loan debt, or retail loan debt (i.e. phone financing etc)

I budget $500/mo for my dog (whatever is left over goes to a fund for potential medical expenses)

Utilities/Bills usually total around $400 (absolute max)

Admittedly I'm a bit of a spendy person when it comes to going out/eating out, but that's by choice and is entirely malleable and can be reduced at a whim.
Last month I spent $1000 on eating out/going out


Onto where I'm conflicted. Moving to a HCOL area obviously will cost more. 

I'm thinking I should pay $3k/mo for rent + parking, but I'm not sure if that's excessive (or i could be affording more?)
I won't live with roommates as I have personal issues that make it incredibly difficult to share a space. I'm fairly young, single, and would like to be socially active, so I'm ready to pay a premium to be ""in it"" so to speak.

1536,personalfinance,"I bought my house a bit over two years ago for $475k. I refinanced during peak Covid and got my rate reduced. It's an FHA 30-year fixed rate mortgage locked in at 2.375%.

I work from home full-time now and, frankly, I'm wondering why I live in the city. I'd like to move across the country to Maine (from Portland, Oregon), but I'm not to keen on getting a new mortgage at 6.5% or whatever the new rate is currently. I can get so much more for my money out east.

I'm curious what my options are? I've been reading about mortgage porting, allowing you to essentially keep your current terms and move into a new property, but I just got off the phone with my lender and she doesn't think that's possible with an FHA loan. Damn, it seemed like such a great option...

I've also thought about getting a second mortgage and renting this house out. I make $155k/year, so I think I'd be able to afford a second mortgage if I'm able to rent out this one. But, I guess that's a whole thing, too, because I would need to rent out my house before I can get the second loan or at least have a lease signed?

Do I have any other options or will I just have to sell, get a new mortgage, and refinance once rates come back down?

I don't have a *ton* of debt. I've balance transferred debt from a few cards and kept paying it off, and my credit score is around 730 at the moment.

I have $5,000~ between two cards from balance transfer deals that have 0% APR until December this year.

I have $4,500 on a card that has 18%~ APR (AmEx). The thing is, I'm in the middle of moving in with my partner (saving money after the move also), so money is really tight. I have good habits - most of the debt was from medical bills that balance transfers helped me from accruing interest while paying it off (started with close to $18k~).

Is a loan from a place like Upstart worth paying off the 4.5k~ card that has APR on it? I went through the process and my loan for 5K would have 10% APR - which makes sense hypothetically to move forward with. In addition - with us moving in together, we have our security deposit + other moving fees to pay.

Is it dumb for me to apply for a $6K loan at 8-10%, use most of that for my 18% APR balance and pay it off, and the rest for moving costs? And then of course the focus becomes paying off the 0% APR balance transfer debt - but obviously the interest debt comes first.

Any thoughts here? I have a good 401K that I contribute my max too - don't want to take a loan from that.. but I have no clue if that's better...

1) In January 2022, I contributed $6,000 to my Roth IRA (on Vanguard).
2) By the end of the year, my annual income is way above the Roth IRA contribution limit. 
3) Called Vanguard and told them to remove the excess from my Roth IRA and transfer the funds to my Roth Traditional account (which I opened just now). I think this was called re-characterization. They moved the extra funds from my Roth IRA to my Roth Traditional account. Because this year was red, and I was in loss, they moved around $5,300 to Roth Traditional. This action has generated a form that I will present to my accountant when doing the taxes. 
4) Once the funds were settled in Roth Traditional acc, I asked Vanguard to do a conversion and transfer them to Roth IRA. They did and they told me that I must fill form 8606.

My questions:
1) When I fill this form, should I declare just $5,300?
2) Where am I submitting this form? (to the IRS website?!)
3) What should I bring to my accountant when doing the taxes?
4) Is this amount nondeductible or not (this is the part that confuses me most and I'm not sure how to proceed, the funds came from my net salary).

Any suggestion would help, thank you.",Question about form 8606 (re-characterization and Roth conversion),1672853670

I know that I can rollover the funds to a Roth IRA and be in more control of what happens with the money. However, with how stocks are performing right now, does it make sense to transfer this decreased amount (I began investing to it 2019)? Does it make more sense for these funds to accrue gains before transferring?

1560,personalfinance," Me and my husband moved to a new town and bought a house 3 years ago. Since then because of various factors...including unexpected expenses we thought could wait (something in the house which wasn't an issue when inspected but then became an issue that needed dealt with after a bad storm), no matter how we budget, scrimp and save. Things keep coming up which cause us to resort to living paycheck to paycheck and accumulating debt. I am suppose to be bringing in a second income but my husband's job lied to him about having a steady schedule by now. So his schedule is all over the place and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. And as such i am the designated pick up and drop off for the children since we live within town limits so they don't provide a bus service for them. We don't have any relatives or family or even friends nearby to help us so it's just me and my husband. This isn't how we thought we were going to be living, me and my husband are pretty miserable...

We wish we could just sell this house and move into a a less expensive home, possible a double wide trailer in the meantime until we get rid of our debts, until his schedule is more reliable so we can coordinate schedules and i can work too. Thing is, this is our first home and we don't know how do we go about just selling this house. We still owe a mortgage which we are paying monthly. What's the first step we take?

1562,personalfinance,"Hi, I hope I’m in the right place. I’m looking for advice/opinions on my current financial situation and curious if buying/building a home is the right decision for me given the current market. 

Context: 

I’m a 26 year old single adult in South-Midwest USA. I currently have the privilege to live in my parents house due to both personal and financial reasons. Since I don’t pay actual rent I have been able to save up a few thousand dollars and I’ve even dabbled a bit with investing the last year (nothing crazy, just some mutual funds and a 401k with my work). I have no immediate plans to move out nor are my parents planning to kick me out,  but obviously I don’t want to live with my parents forever. 


I have recently been offered the opportunity to buy some land off another relative for an extremely discounted price. (They’re asking $500 cash for 3 acres of land, kind of a steal)
Having my own property already would (presumably) make building a small home a more realistic option for me since I could use the land as collateral. I’m just not sure if this is a wise decision financially? 

I’ve been looking around for months on rent/mortgage prices in my area and I’ve been comparing them to the average cost of building a small home/building/trailer.  I’ve found that the price is basically the same either way, and that doesn’t even include the price of land. So I’m thinking if I’m paying the same amount either way + basically getting free land I’m kind of stupid not to take this opportunity, right?

I just worry I’m being too naive and not considering this from all possible angles. One of my biggest regrets in life was listening to all of the adults in my life telling me to go to college despite the huge financial consequences. I don’t want to make this decision as carelessly. I have never owned land or a home, my only experience is renting a few different apartments during my college years. Furthermore I haven’t borrowed this much money before. There are a lot of “what ifs” and I’m not sure if it’s wise to make a commitment like this. 

More context: 

- I’m very in debt. I owe about $80k in student debt. I haven’t started paying my federal loans back yet due to deferment but I have been making pretty aggressive monthly payments for the private loan I borrowed. I anticipate to have the private loan paid off by the end of this year. I also still owe on my car and will for another few years. These things alone I feel like are flat no-no’s to a lender, my debt to income ratio is kinda screwed right now. Even if I can secure a loan, I feel it will be absurdly high interest/monthly payment. 

- The land in question is very close to a popular liquor distillery that gets a lot of tourism. I don’t think I’d have much trouble selling the land/home later down the road should I decide to move, 
but that is a “what-if” that worries me a little. There’s no telling the future. 

I think that about covers it. If anyone has any input or advice it would greatly appreciated! Thanks",Is Buying a Home a good decision for me?,1672852658

I heard on other Reddit posts that some people are using VUSXX and other Treasury Money Market Funds as a replacement to a high-yield savings account and they say it is very liquid. But I noticed that the short-term government bonds the fund buys have an average maturity date of 28 days. So what happens if a lot of people want to take their money out? Would the fund then have to sell the bonds before maturity? If they do, wouldn't the fund lose money and that would mean VUSXX isn't as safe as a high-yield savings account?

I want to start up a retirement account to start saving. My plan is generally to dump about 17% into a 401k to drop me down the lower tax bracket so I don't pay any of those additional taxes.

I'm debating on what payment option to take for a coding BootCamp. They offer three options:

1. A 6-month program paid upfront at $20,000
2. A 6-month Program is deferred at no interest for $31,000, paid by 15% of your monthly salary once you do get a job.
3. A 12-month part-time program deferred at no interest for $33,000, paid by 15% of your monthly salary once you get a job

For all of them, you are given 12 months to find a job after you finish the program, but I'm assuming it will take me six months to land a job after each program.

1614,personalfinance,"So I joined my company about a year ago where the company's 6% match was immediately vested. For 2023, they switched to 3 year cliff vesting. In short, the company match won't be vested for the next 2 years. My income is low $100ks and I expect this to grow modestly through my career.

I do not expect to stay at this job for another 2 years for a slew of reasons. In fact, I had just gotten through a tough interview process before getting told ""we want to hire you but they just froze hiring"". They said they'll reach out to me mid-year when they expect the freeze to be over. Even if they don't call me back, I plan on leaving in the next year.

Up until now, I've been contributing 6% to fully leverage their match. Obviously, my own pre-tax contributions to the 401k are nice. The funds are OK and I ultimately will probably just roll over into my IRA that I manage.

Is it in my best interest to just continue contributing the full 6% or should I just take my full paycheck and contribute it to my IRA?

1615,personalfinance,"Hi All - I have two fairly specific, related collections questions I'd be grateful for some guidance on. The TL;DR is I got calls from collections agencies about two different bills, one which I never received the original of, and the second which I tried to pay but never received an answer from the company on how to access their system to make a payment. Trying to figure out how to resolve these without tanking my credit report, which I've tried very hard to keep pristine :)

I got a call from a collections agency saying a FedEx invoice I owed was in collections (value of $51.50). I was pretty surprised because I never received snail mail or email information about this bill/invoice; the first I heard of it was when collections called me. That being said, I made two big moves recently (one domestic within the US, and one international, I'm now based in the Middle East), so there's a chance it was never forwarded (I did set up mail forwarding to be safe). Now, this is a $50 bill, I just want to pay the damn thing. But I'm concerned about this showing up on my credit report. It's not currently on my report, but my understanding is if I pay the bill, it may still show up on later; at that point, do I have any recourse? Would showing them proof that I paid the bill be sufficient to get it removed from my report? Is it worth contacting the collections agency and asking for confirmation that this won't get reported before I pay? I've never dealt with collections, so not sure what a reasonable ask is here.

The second issue is with ConEd, the NYC electric company. I closed my account with them when I left NYC last summer and transferred everything to the new tenant. A few months later I got an email truing up the amount I owed after a meter reading (about $300), which I was ready to pay. Problem was their website wouldn't let me log on to the system to pay b/c my account was closed, so I emailed support asking for guidance on how to pay, but never heard back. I called them, they told me to email support.....So a few weeks ago I get a call from collections about the bill, which on a personal level I find frustrating given that ConEd sent me a bill with no way to pay it, but that is neither here nor there. I asked them to email me the invoice with payment instructions, but haven't heard from them. They even took down my email address, so not sure what the deal is. This one is also not on my credit report, but I'm not quite sure what to do. I stupidly didn't write down the name of the collections agency so don't know how to follow up. I *do* have a copy of my email to ConEd requesting guidance on making the payment, but as of now, that's the only proof I had that I tried to fix this debacle. Any ideas on what a reasonable next step should be? Am I just a sitting duck until they either contact me again, or this shows up on my credit report?

I've never had anything sent to collections before, and I'm not trying to shirk my financial responsibilities here, but I also know that navigating collections agency can be tricky and I just want to do the right thing while protecting myself/my credit history.

We are both in our late 40s and hope to retire in our late 50s. By that age our last child will be in college.

We have had a brokerage account with Morgan Stanley for over 15 years. I also keep a rolled over IRA with them. The performance of the investment hasn’t outpaced non fee based investments but I’ve stuck with them because they assist with financial planning and review our entire portfolio. They have also assisted with questions about real estate planning (purchased a second home for my mother to live in). However, the support has dropped in recent years to levels that make me want to try something different.

Most of our investments are with Fidelity now (401ks, early career Roths). I also just move our emergency fund to Fidelity because I can draw better interest rates than B of A these days (although I’m still trying to identify the best fund). I‘m planning to do in kind transfer to Fidelity from my investments at Morgan Stanley. I met with someone at Fidelity to discuss the process and to be quite honest, I wasn’t overly impressed with the guy. Consolidating all of our accounts at Fidelity, we are in the ballpark of 2m so I was disappointed in the first interaction. I’m also not impressed with some of the tools available on the Fidelity website. I recall tools in the past that helped with balancing your portfolio based on your risk profile. I can’t seem to track them down now.

1649,personalfinance,"My situation: I’m a 21 y/o international student studying in the US, with some decent savings from past internships. I recently decided to get into investing, starting out with some low-risk index funds such as those offered by Vanguard. I realised that a Roth IRA would be a great way to go about it for this year and next (up until I start working full-time and my potential income exceeds the Roth limit).

I was thinking of investing maxing out the combined contribution over this year and next to 13k. I wanted to check if my understanding was clear:

* I can withdraw any earnings tax-free after a 5 year period if I invest in the index fund through a Roth IRA (in the situation that I need to leave the US and use this money at home, for example) and any principal amount tax-free at any point?
* If my full-time income after next April exceeds the limit, I can still contribute this year and next year prior to April? \[Unsure about this point--*I'm confused about what is considered a yearly income by a Roth IRA*\]

I also wanted to hear thoughts on whether creating a Roth for this amount (6.5-13k) makes sense, if I won’t be able to contribute towards it past next year? I am not sure how deductions of 401k work, but I'm assuming a pre-tax full-time income of around 180k starting next year, including bonus.

I only had minimum insurance cover (now increased) and my insurance say they have been trying to negotiate a settlement within my policy limit but have been unable to do so. They say that they now expect her to be suing for damages and I should shortly be getting served with court papers.

A friend of the family who works as a financial advisor put me on a plan that would pay off my car by this year August by directing pretty much all of my excess funds at my loan.
Now I do have about 21k(the same amount remaining on the loan) in a HYSA that gains 3.75% APY. From my calculations just from parking my money here I get approx $780 a year.


My car loan balance is 21k &amp; my note is $443 with 52 payments left ($23,036). Essentially it's costing. me 2k over 4 years for the loan. That makes it 500$ a year.

Isn't it safe to say there's no major drawback from continuously paying just the note as long as my HYSA pays me 3.75%?

1703,personalfinance,"Hi team, seeking some forecasting strategies or advice for a year full of varying expenses MoM and past expenses that don't seem necessarily indicative of future spending habits. 

**Life situation:** 

* Been living with my fiance at her moms (rent free) for the past 6 months 
* Getting married end of March and will be spending about $25k on our wedding over the next 3 months
* Both with predictable salaries and get paid twice a month
* Would like to move into our own apartment soon (ideally before our wedding - budget permitting)
* Started tracking expenses in Mint since October, however, it has been hard to trust using those expense categories in a forecast for 2023 because we've been traveling / eating out more, spending much less on groceries and haven't been paying rent
* We have travel aspirations this year (Honeymoon &amp; plenty of weddings) that we want to budget well for to help us decide if we need to make some sacrifices this year, and or to help alleviate my financial stress
* I will also add that last year was a bit of a tough year for me where my salary was below my cost of living (Damn you Bay Area...) and I only recently was able to crawl back from CC debt thanks to the living situation with the future mother-in-law &lt;3

All this to say, I have been somewhat paralyzed trying to put together a 2023 plan for ourselves. My current thought process is: 

1. **Nail down a reliable estimate per general category / month** (Groceries/dining, Bills, Car, shopping, Health care, personal) - really difficult to nail down when I don't feel I can really trust the last 3 months of Mint charges (very high travel expenses, for example)  - *any advice on how to do this effectively?* 
2. **Adjust those expenses by month** (increase rent, grocery, utility costs when we plan to move out)
3. **Add in large ad hoc planned expenses** throughout the year to account for our potential plans (Honeymoon flight purchase in Feb, Paying wedding photographer in march, etc.)
4. **Nail down savings** \- Understand which months can we actually expect some savings. Unfortunately, given all of the increased expenses with wedding &amp; moving out it feels like we'll have to deprioritize monthly savings in the short term to be able to fund some of these big purchases (I'd like to not do this obviously, as we'd love to start saving up to buy a house)

So I'm seeing if anyone has any forecasting strategies or advice they might be able to help me out with to nail down our financial plans for this year full of expense changes. 

**Ultimately my goal is to understand:** can we afford ALL of those weddings we got invited to? Can we  afford a 2 bedroom Apartment in LA? Is it feasible for us to get a dog? And to generally get control, understand, ownership of our financial situation, to stop stressing about money and big purchase decisions. 

FYI I am trialing out YNAB, but realize that the tool is less for forecasting and more for getting some ownership over our finances (especially since we'll be combining most of our finances)

She can easily pay off 2-3 of the cards as they are only $300 each. But the last 3 start at $1,000 and go upwards from there.

To add to this she has very little income. I'm talking 800-1000 a month. And that's if I pay for all her living stuff so her whole check goes straight towards her debt. 

The problem being of course I have no idea if she is making so little that she is basically throwing her money in a bottomless pit and she's going to keep owing more and more?

So any advice will help. Does she pursue bankruptcy? She is 30. I just dont see how she can get out of this if she doesnt make enough money unless someone gave her the money which her parents nor i am willing to do. And letting this go for this long not doing anything about it.

1745,personalfinance,"My step mother has no line of credit. After my dad's death, the bank won't transfer the car loan to her because of this. It really makes sense for her to keep this reliable vehicle that's already partially paid off rather than give it up for a junker she doesn't have to finance that will nickel and dime her to death.

She's asked me how I feel about co-signing the auto loan.

FWIW, I'm in my mid-40s, 750+ credit score, 6 figure income, no debt other than my mortgage, which has $170k remaining, because I haven't had this house that long. It'll probably also be a long time before I need to purchase another vehicle, myself.

I don't have a ton in savings, though, outside of my 401k for retirement, because I paid off a lot of medical debt over the past 3 yrs, so as much as I'd like to help her avoid the loan, I can't just gift/lend her a large lump sum of money, because that would wipe out the remainder of my savings. With debt gone, I'm shifting focus this year to building my personal savings back up.

Step-mom has no problems making the payments, just can't get the loan. She's on a fixed income from my dad's pension/social security, and works part-time. I know she'll go to working full time if she needs to, but her earning potential is low.

1746,personalfinance,"Hi all, the title pretty much says it all. To give a bit of a rundown of my situation, I currently work 2 jobs. One is as an adjunct professor at a small fine arts college and the other is in customer service at a grocery store. Neither job pays super well, but since I’ve been living at home with my mom and haven’t been paying rent I’ve managed to put a few thousand in a 401K as well as a few more in a checking/savings account. I currently live in a medium sized city in the Midwest, so things are relatively affordable. 

So as the title says, I’m just starting to get to the point where I’m making about enough to afford renting an apt and living on my own in the city. This is tempting as most of my friends who are my age are currently living downtown and doing the whole “city life” thing i.e. dating, being near bars/restaurants, having a bunch of people their age near by and since I’ve been living with my mom for the last couple of years I feel like I’m missing out a bit. 

But on the flip side of that, I’m looking at apartment rentals in my city and notice that I’d be paying the same monthly amount in some places as a mortgage. All I would have to do to buy a house is save up for a down payment. 

I don’t know. I guess I just want peoples insight/opinions. Is it crazy to stay with my mom till I’m potentially in my mid-late 30’s if I can eventually buy a house, or should I just bite the bullet and start renting now, knowing that’ll it be way more difficult to save for a down payment in the future?

1757,personalfinance,"Alright, so I recently ended my service with the State of Ohio after 10 years. I’m currently 37. If I do nothing and leave my pension where it is, I’ll get an estimated $1,717/month when I retire at 67.

I currently have $123,000 in my OPERS account that can be refunded. I’m also going back to the federal government where I’ll receive a pension (currently have 4 ½ years and plan on staying indefinitely.)

I currently have:

$25,000 in TSP
$13,000 in Deferred Comp
$6,300 in IRA
$11,000 in HSA
$11,000 in mutual funds

Debt:

$200,000 – Mortgage at 3.625%
$34,000 – Personal loan (Home improvement) – 6.34%
$12,000 – Car loan – 3.74%
$27,000 – Car loan – 2.5%
Cash/Emergency Fund - $15,000

If I rolled the entire amount over to an IRA, at 65 with a 7% annual ROI, it looks like it would be around $817,000. If my math is correct, I’d have to live 40 years after retirement to receive that much via my pension.

Two questions:

Should I leave my pension with OPERS or roll it over to an IRA? Although I’m generally an optimist, I don’t trust OPERS to remain solvent long-term, nor do I trust our fat cats in Columbus to keep their hands out of the cookie jar forever. I’d also like to roll it over while the market is down. 

Should I cash out enough to pay off the $34,000 personal loan since the interest rate is high? I believe, in additional to the taxes, there’s a 10% penalty for cashing out any of my pension early. I’m hesitant to do this, but the thought is appealing.

In April I got a double whammy -- I found out my job was being terminated in 30 days due to a merger, and I got diagnosed with Acute Leukemia. I had to stop everything and check-in for an undetermined amount of time to start immediate chemo treatments. My old boss found out that I was diagnosed on my last day at work, and felt terrible. They suggested (since I had to start treatment that same night) I jump on COBRA to extend my coverage, and my boss offered to pay for the next 6 months of COBRA while I was getting treatment. It was a really nice gesture. 

Since I had lost my job (and consequently, the job I was interviewing for to move over to) and was stuck in the hospital, I also qualified for Medicaid as a secondary insurance. Since I'd met my deductible on my primary, and had Medicaid as my secondary, I was assured by the oncology / hospital ""you shouldn't have to pay out of pocket for any more procedures."" 

Now, at the end of 2022, I've had several chemo treatments and a bone marrow transplant. I get a bill for $900 worth of services. I call the hospital. ""Your insurance denied it."" Both of them? ""Both of them."" Hmmm. I call the insurance company. ""Oh we didn't deny it, they coded the bill wrong. It's not a surgery, it's a cancer treatment. Different code, different billing departments."" Okay. Call hospital. Tell them they billed it wrong. ""Okay!"" A month goes by, I hear nothing. 

Today I get a notification from a COLLECTIONS AGENCY for the $900 bill. What?? I'm livid. How do I go about this? Who do I call first? How do I cover myself here? I'm so lost with all of this, still very sick and recovering from the transplant, and just feel very... screwed over here, for lack of a better term.

* She has about 20k in student loans.

1799,personalfinance,"My partner and I have racked up a large amount of debt on a credit card with a staggeringly high APR. I'm an authorized user on this card and I hadn't realized that the rate was so high until last month when I wanted to know for sure because we felt like we were getting nowhere with the payments.

Debt is ~9k and the interest rate is ~28%

Knowing that, I wanted to try and get our balance transferred to another card with a low rate (or none for a starting period) so we could have some room to breathe. To this end, we signed up for the Citi Simplicity card hoping it could help us. Got the card, limit is $2000, and we've called support to get it raised and were declined due to the newness of the account. We're not even going to touch this one if we can't use it the way we planned to.

The original card is paused and we haven't spent with it in months now. I've committed to paying it down $500 a month. Partner has agreed to that as well, but they can be inconsistent because of the nature of their job. So I see two timelines, one where we pay $1000/mo and one where we pay $500/mo.

With $1000/mo, if my numbers are correct, we'll have this thing paid off in about 10 months and incur ~$1000 in fees. If we trend closer to $500 each month, we'll pay it off in 2 years and incur ~$2300 in fees.

With our new card, the balance transfer method only seems to work if we can get a credit limit that can cover the bulk of the debt. Doing it $2000 at a time will incur 5% transfer fees, and the original debt is still accruing interest while we pay the other card off.

So now I'm not sure what to do...

Typical car dealer shit I suppose and my fault for not being more careful. Lesson learned. I went back the next day and asked that they take off all of that crap, which resulted in upper four figure ""payment"" to the loan, since the loan was already created. My payment stayed the same. I was paying $685 as a round number autopay through Dec 2022. At this point, the ""total amount due is $671"" on the payments. I have an emergency fund, I am financially healthy, and have a fairly diverse portfolio. 

1) I have the liquid cash to pay off the car in it's entirety, but I have been thinking about a brokered CD on a 1 year that would beat the 1.9% APR of the loan and then renew or shift somewhere else or open to ideas. Given that there is 3 years left on the loan, I figured that would work better and I can revisit things after the 1 year mark. What do you all think?

2) I could be wrong...but due to inflation the longer that I have this loan the worse it is for the bank holding the auto loan. I am actually doing them a favor paying this off fast. Correct? 3) Lastly, I set up a new autopay for the ""total amount due"" for January and the bank charged the original payment amount of $683 instead of the $671. No way around it and I must pay minimum $683 month to month? I could have sworn as the loan goes down you can pay the total amount due instead of the original payment amount?

I am a newer ""higher income"" earner and have always historically invested in both a traditional IRA and Roth IRA.  I was contributing to my Roth IRA for 2022 until August when I realized I was over the allowed AGI to contribute to a Roth.  

I had a pre-existing Traditional IRA (from a previous employer 401k rollvover) and contributed to it instead of the Roth IRA thinking it was a smart idea since my 401k was maxed and it was an option for additional investments as of August until current.  This was before I knew about backdoor Roths. 

So, for 2023, I'd like to do a backdoor Roth.  The issue is that I have this pre-existing Traditional IRA that has quite a bit of money in it.  My thought was to do a reverse rollover into my current employer 401k, but I made the mistake of contributing money into it that are no longer pre-tax as of August of this year (see above).

  
My questions are:

* Can I just withdraw the Roth IRA contributions as cash without penalty since I shouldn't have made them?
* Can I still do the reverse rollover from the traditional IRA to my employer 401k even though there are 4 months worth of contributions that are not 'pre-tax' so that I can begin doing clean backdoor roths as of 2023?  If I can't do the reverse rollover due to the post-tax IRA contributions that I've made in 2022, what are my options?

I have of course been declaring this account when doing my taxes in the US every year.

I have since become a US LPR and I am going to continue living in the US for the foreseeable future (10 years+, at least), so I was thinking about what to do with this money and this account going forward.

1830,personalfinance,"Profile:

- 23 yo, with a gross annual income of 62k/year. It’s my first job out of college. I started 6 months ago, but I plan to leave after 16-20 months for another job depending on the economy.
- Take-home pay per month: $4k
- Total expenses per month (includes $200 allowance for fun money): $2k
- Emergency fund: $9,300 in a HYSA as of December 2022
- Federal student loans: $14,500 (2-4% APR, but no interest has accrued)
- Private student loans: $10,470 (5.79% fixed APR on a 5-year payment plan, where I have been paying $202.05/month since September 2022)
- No CC debt

I’m not worried (yet) about my federal student loans, but I am wondering if I should continue investing in this bear market or pay off my private student loans in full. Over 5 years, it will accumulate ~$1,650 in interest—$330/year. 

I started investing in late-November 2022. I have $3,000 (principal) so far in a taxable brokerage account—60% VT, 10% each of SCHD, SCHG, AVUV, and individual stocks. 

However, I will begin funding a Roth IRA this month that I will max out before funding my taxable account. My job doesn’t start matching a 403b until I have put in one year of service in July 2023, at which point they will match my 5% with 8% on their end (13% total). My take-home pay should roughly be the same after 5% pre-tax starts getting taken out on account that my taxes get lower as well. 

I plan to retire early at 45 yo in my native country (Philippines), where the cost of living is much lower; and so I don’t ever plan on maxing out my 403b—or 401k if and when I do switch to a private sector. I haven’t crunched the numbers, but I feel that maxing out my Roth IRA every year going forward is more than enough to cover my expenses from 60 yo onwards.

Given that I have finished building my emergency fund, 
- **should I invest the $2k that I have left-over per month after my expenses;**
- **pay off my private student loans in full this month with my emergency fund and start my emergency fund all over again;**
- **or make $2k per month in extra payments towards my private student loans?**","Should I continue investing in this bear market, or pay off my private student loans in full before investing?",1672791351

I have been working through some previous financial issues in the past couple of years and now I am happy to say that I am debt free and in a healthy cash position as of now.

Another bit of context is I am in my mid 30s, currently saving 60% of my income per month, live outside the USA and have limited access to investment platforms here and currently have no other investments other than my cash in a deposit with monthly renewals.

Now the question I have been pondering is the following:

1. Go all in into an SP500 fund through Charles Schwabb and continue investing my monthly savings and hope for the long term gains.
2. Buy a rental property (probably an apartment downtown in the capital), paying no less than 50% of the asking price and financing 50% or less. Pay the loan + all extra savings into the principal to try and pay off the property. The idea being into creating a cashflow stream in the medium term. Probably once I have 3-4 apartments start diversifying my savings into SP500+rental.

All help is appreciated as I am a bit lost on what to start focusing at this stage. I understand the possible gains of Stock market over time, however, I am also interested in looking into quitting my job for another one with less stress/responsibilities but without sacrificing so much income and saving capacity.

My house is paid off and worth \~850 K. I feel that I'm not making use of the value of the house now that it is paid off. 

I have been investing in low-cost mutual funds tracking the S&amp;P for the past 20 years, and that is the bulk of my net worth. 

Would getting a loan toward the value of the home make sense? I was thinking to pull out maybe 5 to 600K and immediately invest 4 to 500K in an S&amp;P fund (or dollar cost average in over the next 6 months). 

I was going to keep 1 to 200K on hand to help manage the monthly payments as I am in a ""soft"" retirement phase of my life, no active income, other than my investments. 

I do have excellent credit, so was thinking the amount I borrow would be at a rate far below what my investment accounts will average over the next 10 years.

My employer missed sending out my paycheck on 12/30/22 due to some complications with a corporate merger.

HR is having the payroll company that was used in 2022 issue a new paycheck to correct the issue with the correct pay period of 12/17/2022-12/30/2022, however, the check itself dated in 2023 and they are pulling additional SocSec taxes and a 401k contribution as if they reset for 2023, even though both were maxed out in November of 2022.

In my thinking, I cannot have the 401k pull on there as it would be past the max allowed for the 2022 year (which is when this pay period is from) and I shouldn't need to contribute additional SocSec taxes as for 2022 they were already completed and my last few stubs has a $0 value for those.

I am a project manager for an engineering company. I have had my position for around 5 years.
I do good work, consistently get good reviews and have normally received decent yearly raises.  

This past year was tough. Some things happened early this year with the company owner who had a lot to do with the day to day inner workings of the business, and he had to take a huge step back. This was followed almost immediately with the other project manager quitting.  I was handed about 50% of the workload, (on top of my usual work) but somehow managed to make it through. It was a hard year. My boss did give me a small bonus (first bonus ever, despite bonus/profit sharing being a talking point and dangling carrot for years! We never thought they would actually follow thru on it)
I honestly just felt like it was the least they could do considering how much more work and stress I was absorbing with the internal company changes. 

All in all, it wasn't a great year. Things still are not back to normal, and it seems the expectation moving forward is that my work load will not go back to how it was in 2021/early 22. 

I was curious what contract would look like this year.  I received it this week, and was disappointed to see that I was receiving a 2% raise. By far the lowest I've ever received.  My review was great, they were happy with me and my work. 
Considering cost of living has increased in my area by 7.5 %, and I know the company has priced new work accordingly, I wasn't thrilled and spoke to my manager, who said that they've decided to start doing a yearly bonus at the end of the year, (up to 8% of my current wage) if certain profit margins are met. So basically, I AM receiving a raise according to them, it's just in the form of a bonus. 


I really don't know how to feel. To me, a bonus is meant to be a bonus, and considering how long they've been talking about it and dangling the carrot, it feels a bit sneaky to finally initiate the bonus, but do it in lieu of a raise. 

Am I crazy? I don't want to sound ungrateful for the potential bonus opportunity, but it just feels off.

For the year 2021, our AGI was \~$132k, and both my wife and I earned over $6k that year. All good.

For the year 2022 however, I believe our AGI will be \~$210k, so pretty close to the contribution limit for 2022 ($204k - $214k). I am not sure how to confirm that AGI before filing for 2022.

For the year 2023, I would expect our AGI to be \~$220k, once again very close to the contribution limit for 2023 ($218k - $228k). So at this point I believe we won't contribute to our Roth IRAs for 2023 and open traditional IRAs instead.

Because of this situation I have a couple of questions:

 \- I'm still not sure how to calculate MAGI from AGI. Our tax situation is pretty simple (filing jointly, no mortgage, no student loan, standard W2 employment for both), so can I assume that AGI = MAGI?

 \- Should we deduct the amount of IRA contributions from AGI (so $12k for 2022 for example)? I see you can also deduct tuition and fees, what does that cover? Childcare expenses?

 \- If we contributed more than we should have for 2022, how do I correct our contribution? Should I just reach out to Vanguard directly?

 \- What would the penalty be? 6% of the over-contributed amount per year? So if we contributed $1000 over the limit and I do the correction before March/April 2023, I can expect a $60 penalty?

1889,personalfinance,"I am 27 currently. I dropped out of my BS in CS degree a bit over a year ago, mainly because of burnout and living with my parents in suburban SC after they moved. I moved back to CO on a huge whim and it actually turned out about as well as it could have. I am now making 76k with a raise to 78k this spring working a union job in Pueblo CO.

Houses are expensive here but it seems like after 2023 things may get more reasonable (330k for a new house for example). Company is about as good as you can get in my field, there's 1 other place 1-1.5 hours away where I could make a few dollars more but realistically this is it. I'm not sure I can fathom working this job for 30-40 more years but it is very cushy and legitimately may be the best job in the whole industry with everything accounted for, or at least among the top ones. I could make more but it'd be doing 3rd shift in a more expensive area which I have no desire to do.

We have some downtime at work so I started programming again and finished a big side project. Prior to that I did an internship at the end of my 2nd year in CS as a software engineer intern. It got me thinking about finishing my degree. Long story short the local and online options just don't seem good to me. So it seems like if I want to finish the degree I'd need to go back to SC for 2 years, which the university has approved with in-state residency as a readmit. I'm considering a 4 month lease just to sort my life out before the next semester as leaving this weekend would be very short-notice and my gf is not thrilled about the possibility of living with my parents for 2 years. I have 25k in savings so I could rent but I'd want to do at least a year with them to cushion the blow.

I don't know if leaving this job would be a mistake. It's very easy, pretty enjoyable, and presumably will afford a house in the area after this chaos ends in time. I am worried about staying and in 8 years getting laid off or something. Software would make me more and give me more flexibility but it's hard to say my current job isn't slightly more enjoyable.

TL;DR: Can I call Villainy Bank, ask them to reinstate the accounts and continue making payments? Is that a thing? 

Or do I just settle for 25-50% of the balances due, and accept I'm not doing business with VB for 7 years, if ever again? Will my credit report show that I settled, and for what percentage?


Trying to make long story short, life has sucked and I basically stopped paying bills for 6+ months. I moved, Villainy Bank's letters returned as undeliverable and I guess they assumed I flaked on them. One regular credit card ~$4K line and one ""promotional financing"" ~$1K line auto repair card. Both, of course, maxed out.

If Villainy Bank had said ""pay up by x date or it's going to collections"", I would've done it. They called about a billion times but never laid out a timeline by which account would be charged off. My other credit lines did, and those I paid up.  

The good news: the VB credit card never showed up on my report, for some reason. The auto repair card did, but neither are showing up now. 

I'm not some lowlife deadbeat. I spent the money, and I then spent more money instead of paying back the money I spent. So I want to pay back the bank if I can. But if I can't, they abandoned me by charging off my account, so screw them &amp; I'll settle it with the agency.

1923,personalfinance,"Hello, r/personalfinance! We (upper 20s) are expecting our second child in May in MCOL area(WI). We both work full time for the same employer, in non-patient care Healthcare field and have WFM flexibility. My wife has always seen working as a means to an end but is terrified of financial instability, due to circumstances growing up. However, with the cost of daycare we are looking at ways of making a transition for her to SAHM. She would prefer to raise them over working a less fulfilling job, if possible for the next 4-5 years. Daycare costs would go from 7k to 20k if we chose that route (would have to move daycares and go from part time to full time for first child).

Current combined income is $101k ($52k &amp; $48k) before taxes, and it is likely I will receive a promotion in the department in the next year as everyone in our department has received this promotion after reaching my experience level ($52k to $67k). If not, there is a competing employer hiring for my exact position that this is their salary floor. I plan on applying regardless but prefer to continue where I am.

Additionally, my BIL and his wife are expecting in April and have expressed interest in paying my wife to watch our niece. My wife would love to do this as well, charging a “fair” rate (slightly under market value, around $8-9k), but we also want to consider tax implications of this for them and us (report income vs. cash, deductions,  etc). They make about the same as we currently do. We are close and on very good terms but also want to consider contract/liability issues as I am sure that 99% of problems could easily be worked out but would want to be protected.

Wife also considering selling crafts on the side (Etsy, locally, etc.) as she enjoys doing it but we don’t want to rely on this income.

We would also need to purchase a different secondary vehicle (likely minivan) as a 2013 Hyundai Elantra would not be suitable. We currently own our home and 2019 Rav4 that are financed at attractive rates. 

We currently contribute 10% to retirement (employer matches 4%, profit share 6-11%), have 15k in savings (which some may be used for vehicle). 

Apologies for rambling but wanted to include pertinent info. Biggest questions are if people have experience going to SAHM life financially, tax implications of daycare income (small amount from family) and a potential contract/liability issues that may need to be addressed beforehand.",Wife looking a becoming SAHM/daycare for niece- considerations to make?,1672779344

1925,personalfinance,"Hi all,

My situation is fairly straight forward but I've been getting conflicting advice on how to budget. 

I'll be making $80,000 pre tax, more with bonus but I don't want to count on that at all. It should be taxed at 22%, plus social security and stuff will bring it to about 30%? 

So, I'm left with about 55k give or take, or $4600/mo. From here, how do I break this down? I have no car payments or anything like that, my only overhead should be rent and food and gas.

I was looking at 50-30-20 but a guy in my office told me I need to be spending way less than 50% on rent and food and saving way more than 20%. He said I should be spending no more than 20% on rent and 5-10% on food. 

I don't think this is awful advice, but I'm having a hard time finding an adequate apartment in my city for under like 1700. The other thing to consider is if I'm closer to work and paying slightly more, I can walk and save on gas costs.

I feel I have decent financial skills, I have a budget and mostly follow it, I’m working on building up my credit score and I’m focusing on saving but I am concerned I could be making better informed decisions. Currently I make $85/hr which after time off thought the year ends up being around $170,00/yr USD and I don’t see much potential change in my income in the next 2-5 years. Here is a breakdown of where I currently stand:

For pretax contributions my health insurance is quite expensive, $170 a week. I also plan to fully max out my 401K this year. My 401K is the only account I have for retirement and with the market down its currently sitting at ~$27,300. I am concerned that I am not saving enough for retirement but not completely sure how far off target I am. My employer does match but its very bad, the match ends up being ~$1,000-$2,000/year.

I have $76,000 in Federal Student loans ($17,500 in my name &amp; $58,500 in parent plus that I am paying) Currently have $59,500 Saved, mostly from July 2022 Forwards, did not put in HYS as payments were expected to return EOY. Still saving an additional $300 a month, to cover remaining balance and planning to move this into a HYS account until federal payments start again.

I have $17,400 saved for a house, real estate is very bad in my area, I’m targeting to build/buy in 2024 so planning to save $1,000/mo until I buy. That would put ~30K as a down payment for first time home if I purchase in early 2024. I am planning to also move this to a HYS account.

I have $8,800 in an Emergency fund and continuing to save $200/mo. 

I spend about $1000/mo on my car. $200/mo for insurance which I could drop down to about $175/mo. And I have a ~$46,500, 65 month loan at 1.24% leaving me a monthly payment of $845. I also have $8,750 saved for car expenses, mostly tires &amp; registration (very expensive in my state) but could cover any other emergency repairs, I’m not currently adding any additional money to this savings.

I also save ~$400/mo for “fun” stuff, money to spend on concerts/travel/fun experiences etc. Currently this account has $5,600 in it.

Currently I live at my parents home and pay $0 for rent &amp; expenses. I am hoping to move out to an apartment sometime early 2023, I have $5,500 saved up for furniture, and all the one time costs at the start of the lease. I live in a HCOL area so a 1 bedroom will be ~$2,000 - $3,000 a month before utilities. I would prefer a 1br over a studio because I work from home full time and would like the extra space.

I also plan to spend around $225/week on groceries, household supplies and generic spending money once I move out.

I have 3 credit cards, one through my main credit union, one department store card (they were a previous employer and employee discount was easier with the CC), and an Amex gold. I do ~98% of my purchases on one of these 3 cards to get the points/perks and fully pay them off each month.

I have a few main questions and am looking for general advice on things I can do to improve my financial decisions.- Am I saving enough for retirement by just making out my 401K? What other options do I have as I believe my higher income would make me ineligible for some accounts?
- Regarding the $8,750 I have saved for my car, would it be better to keep this saved for car expenses/registration? Or should I put it towards the car loan or allocate that somewhere else?
- Will 30K be enough for a down payment on a home as a first time home buyer? I know this will depend heavily on the market/area but I’m not sure if 30K is reasonable in general or if I should target more.
- Realistically how much can/should I afford for an apartment when I move out? Is 2-3K a month feasible? I for sure want to stay below $3,000/mo for rent &amp; utilities as I know I could better spend that money earning equity, but is that even a realistic target for my income/expense level?

1963,personalfinance,"TL;DR: Looking to buy a home in the Denver area and hopefully take advantage of the housing crash people are predicting this year. My primary objective is to build equity.

My finances are as follows: I'm 27M and work as a software developer making $86k annually. Monthly I take home $4600, of which $1200 goes to rent. After factoring in necessary expenditures (gas, groceries) but before impulse spending, I have $2300 per month (probably spending less than $300/mo recklessly so by a conservative estimate I'm still $2k in the green.) I have $57,000 in liquid assets. My credit score is 760. I have no outstanding loans or debts.

My lease is up in April, but I'm aware that 3-4 months is not enough time to find a house. Ideally I would renew for \~6 months and have something lined up by the time that expires late into the year.

As of right now, Zillow is showing very few listings below $400,000, and the Buy or Rent calculator says that at $400k, I would have to stay there for at least 8 years to break even.

My first question... Is this objective is realistic and worthwhile at this point in time? I figure this crash will be the cheapest property is going to be (especially in Denver) for a pretty long time, which is why I feel pressured to act soon. On the other hand, if I were career-focused enough, I'm sure I could get my career path to outpace inflation.

Some other general questions:

* I'm aware that market fluctuation is unpredictable, but it seems people are still able to make educated guesses about it. Is there a rough estimate on what would be an ideal time to buy?
* Aside from HOA fees, what other considerations are there regarding a condominium?
* Aside from hiring a home inspector, what should I be paying attention to when assessing the quality of a home? I'm capable of using my own eyes and ears, but tips on where to look would be helpful.
* I have no experience negotiating with a bank over things like interest rates. What should I keep an eye out for? If I get a lousy rate can I just walk away and ask a different bank? If I don't have a house lined up, can I just walk in and ask for an estimate for what kind of interest rates I would qualify for based on my income and credit?
* I plan on keeping a decent amount of money in my bank account even after my down payment, as I intend to be prepared for maintenance-related incidents that require immediate attention.

1985,personalfinance,"I am 34 years old.  previously worked a desk job where I did okay, but for various life circumstances I am now going back to school, and had to quit my previous full-time job to do so. Now, I work part-time starbucks while full time back at school, and doordash as additional income. I've always had a buttload of debt, which is no different now, however now that my income has been cut short, I will no longer be making sufficient money to cover all my debts. For minimum monthly payments for car, rent, and loan/credit cards (so, this does not include the cost of food, gas, phone, etc) then I pay $2,800 each month. That means for work at my average pay 15/hour, I'll have to work around 200 hours each month to meet bills, and that's on top of school. Considering I'll likely only get 80-100 at sbux, that means I'll have to do 100 hours of doordash each month. That's my current outlook, and it's really grim. 

I have had little help from people in my life in decades past (I'm 34 now), and due to medical issues and other life circumstances it's been incredibly difficult to get on top of finances. I paid off almost all of my student loans previously, but have been paycheck to paycheck for a while. 

in credit cards/loans, i have about 63k in debt.  i also got a new car (my first one ever!) and i owe 36.6 total still, only had it for a year. Rent is maybe the only thing that might be flexible, although i have already worked out a deal with my gf for somewhat lower rates so that's not really an area i can do much more saving. 

for expenses, I've pretty much limited all expenditures. even for food, I take as much of the expiring food from work as they will let me, to keep costs down. I'm really at a loss. I may have tax return money, and I may have student loan money coming back to me for next semester's classes, but at best these can maybe push me out a month or two. I'm already spent through any of my savings, and right now I'm about in tears every night because I feel so utterly hopeless with my situation.

I know nothing about bankruptcy or anything like that, I'm scared they'd take my car as it's the only asset I have, and I love it, and it's quite reliable. I'd still need a vehicle to get to/from work and school, and not having a car would put a serious dent in my ability to make income to pay debt. I'm working on re-doing my budget, AGAIN, but it just seems there's no amount of hard work and bootstraps that can get me out of this mess. 50 hours a week on top of class seems like so much, and that's provided I get scheduled at sbux and there's doordash availability. 

What should I do? Should I look into bankruptcy options? If i do that, what is the liklihood they'll let me keep the car I have, or will they repossess it? that's my biggest concern. Should I j ust do what i can to work as many hours as i can and prolong all of this? I'll ask my parents for cash, but I expect them to say no / have no funds available. I have all of 2023 remaining for school, and will graduate at end of 2023.

Here is my situation: Hubs and I are the same age (late 30s) and make decent money, although we are in a high COL city so we aren’t wealthy but we are well off. We both max out our retirement and have been since we started our careers around 27 (school before). Because of our higher salaries and with match, we have each been putting 17% away in tax deferred retirement accounts. We own a home and our mortgage is 2.85% so it is cheaper than rent in our city. Have about $15k in stocks, $20k cash, and $20k ibonds that mature this year. So while our retirement is rather healthy (even with the downturn and starting in our late 20s) I would like to have more accessible funds. 

One of the reasons we didn’t save more outside of retirement is because we both had hefty student loans (mine paid off last year hubs done in 18 months). 

The question is this: should I cap our retirement savings at 15% so I can invest/save more in non-retirement accounts? Or should I just keep matching because at this point I’m just splitting hairs and that extra 2% will mean so much more when I retire in 25 years? Like increasing from the $20,500 to $22,500 for 2023 is going to cost less than $100 from my paycheck which I probably won’t notice with my COLA adjustment kicking in.

* 24 years old, making $75,000 in US
* Live in a city, but don't plan to live here for more than a few years, so I don't think buying a house makes sense at the moment, but I would like to own property sometime sooner than later
* No car, only expenses are rent, groceries, and other basic day-to-day things
* Each month I put away around $1000-$1500 into my high yield savings account which is currently at 3.3% APY
* I currently have around $75,000 in my savings account which netted me almost $200 in interest last month
* I have a little under $30,000 in gov student loans, no interest has accrued and the payments are frozen, and I am waiting to pay this until we find out whether the $10,000 relief comes through/when the payments unfreeze
* I switched to a new job last month, so I have two Fidelity 401k pretax accounts
   * The one from my old job has about $20,000 in it (similar salary to the new job, and this was after 2 years)  and is no longer getting any money put into it
   * The new account is set to 8% contribution with a max of $2,000 match from my employer
* My takehome pay is about $2,000 semi-monthly (from around $3,000 gross after taxes, insurance, 401k, etc.)
* My rent is only $800 as a friend bought a house and split the mortgage between himself, me, and our other friend/roommate. However, my rent will probably go up to around $1000-$1300 next year if I move in with my girlfriend as I may be doing

My main concerns are, should I be putting the liquid cash I put in my savings account into some other form of investment like a Vanguard account or something similar? If so, what is the best way to maximize the free money? Should I be putting more into my 401k? 

In general, what are the best ways to invest/plan with my money?

Also, when it comes time to pay the student loans, does it make sense to pay it in full, as I did the math and the current interest rate nets me more in my savings than the interest I accrue on the loans.

2005,personalfinance,"I am hoping to get some good advice and not sure things could get any worse than they are already. I’ll try to be concise while also adding pertinent detail. 

A couple of years ago I (stupidly) co-signed for an apartment for my brother and then a couple of months ago I got notified that I got a negative mark on my credit report. It turned out to be for the apartment for a little over $10K. 

I had started receiving harassing calls from a collection agency a couple of months prior to the negative mark but I never answered. They rarely left voicemails and when they did, they were looking for my brother specifically. I didn’t really piece it together that it was for that apartment. Eventually I blocked the number. A couple of weeks after, I received calls from a different number and they left a voicemail and this was the first time my name was being mentioned.

I ended up answering and they explained what the debt was for. Up to this point, I was under the impression that I was relieved from any co-signing responsibilities. This was due to the fact that I had spoken to the apartment manager 2 months prior to the end of the original 15 month lease contract to ensure that once the contract ended, I did not approve or consent to any extensions or renewals. I was told that my brother had already submitted the notice to move out by the end of that contract.

Fast forward to the day after I received the derogatory mark notification, which is when I left work early to speak to the apartment manager. Of course, the apartment was under new management so this wasn’t the lady I had spoken on the phone to the prior year. Thankfully she was really nice and tried to help me understand as much as possible. She told me that my brothers contract “rolled over” into a month to month plan which meant that I was still responsible as a co-signer. On top of that, she could not provide me a copy of the lease contract for some reason but she had it pulled up on her computer and showed it to me. She pointed out that my name nor signature/initials were nowhere to be found on the contract. 

By this point, I go home to review all my documentation. I found a pre-leasing agreement that I filled out and signed but the form specifically says that it’s not a guarantor binding document and was strictly to see if I qualify for co-signing plus it showed it was for unit X but the actual lease agreement I was shown was for unit Y.

I’ve sent a cease and desist letter to the collection agency along with a copy of the lease agreement and pre-leasing form claiming that this was under dispute. So far the only “proof” they have provided is a copy of that pre-lease form as well as an itemized statement from the apartment (which does not show my name on). I’ve also filed a dispute with Experian which was finalized just this past Friday and the results show “verified and updated”.

So I just now got off the phone with Experian and they claim that they have confirmed that I am responsible but that they cannot provide me with the proof directly. They direct me back to the collection agency for that but as I mentioned their “proof” does not seem valid. 

What should be my next step? Fighting this with a lawyer? Should I expect to pay more than the $10K going this route? I just want this completely removed from my report. My credit report has been flawless up until this point.",Disputing Collections Debt Help,1672769392

I know/knew this is a problem, but I hadn't seen my family in nearly 7 years that while pursuing this DDS that it broke me.  

It's a new year and over the break I have been thinking of business ideas or other avenues to earn extra cash. In the past year I have been ubering in my free time to pay the minimums since Sept. Today, I am left with $11,589.92.

My school loans only cover my living expenses and I have used some of my allocated grocery budget to meet the credit minimums. I have a credit score of 576 now (the beginning of the year I was at 730). I read on here that I could apply to balance transfer cards with 0% interest and I got rejected to two credit line so far.

 I know if I saved 200$/week this year I could pay it all down but in my budget spreadsheet, the minimum monthly payments is 437$. I don't see how I could do both. Everytime I have contributed more to the minimum I still am charged with the interest on the CC that takes nearly half of the minimum payment.

I'm happy enough with my investments as they are, but I've been doing a bit of forward looking planning in terms of how I could access this money eventually. It seems like the restrictions on the 401k are limiting, and perhaps the best path would be roll it over to a Roth IRA so I could access at least my contributions early. However, I believe there is a 5 year wait before it's possible to access any funds in an IRA. With all this in mind, my questions are:  


1. Is the above generally correct?
2. Under what conditions should/shouldn't I consider starting to roll over my Roth 401k to a Roth IRA now in order to start the timer?
3. Does the 5 year rule apply to the funds in the account or the account itself? Ie. If I rollover some today, wait 5 years and then rollover some more, do I have access to all of it or only the funds from today?

2049,personalfinance,"Hello! Sorry if this question seems dumb. I’m 19 and I don’t have much knowledge about financial things and need some help.

So basically, for New Year’s Eve my friends and I got a hotel room. Everything was cool and fun. I put the room on my card because it was my idea. After I checked out I got emailed a bill for 169 dollars. That’s fine that’s the price I was told when I booked. Then when I check my account at home it says my card has a pending charge for 190 dollars.

I called up there to see if there was some explanation for the extra money, and the worker seemed confused and was looking at my reservation from over 6 months ago for prom, where I got snacks and stuff from the lounge and charged the room, however, when I got the bill when I checked out, they never charged me for the snacks. Then he realized his mistake and went to the correct reservation from the night before and said that 169 dollars was the correct price and that it was “probably” just an incidental fee that will go away

So it’s either an incidental fee or they might be trying to charge me for the snacks from 6 months ago I’m not sure since the worker seemed unsure too.

Basically my question is can they charge me for the snacks from last time? If they didn’t put it on the bill last time, and I didn’t get any snacks this time therefore it wasn’t on this bill either, can they charge me for them since it’s not technically on any bill?

Right now the charge is pending, but in the case it doesn’t change to 169 dollars am I allowed to dispute the charge? Or would that be wrong?

I’m not necessarily worried about the 20 dollars, it’s just more of the principle of being overcharged with no clear reason why.","I think I was overcharged, is it okay for me to dispute the charge?",1672765691

Hello, this my first time in this community post and I am sort of in a pickle. To start off, my mom wants to use my credit score to purchase a property in NJ to rent out to people as an investment property. However, I refused because I am saving up for a home for myself down the road.

My mom is remarried and my stepdad does not have credit because he does not have papers. They were talking about purchasing a home among themselves to rent out to others, and my mom asked me to co sign with her for the home. I refused because I want to use my credit down the road to get a loan for myself. Afterwards, my mom got upset with me and said ""I don't help her with anything"". I was confused because whenever she needed something I was always there and I never ask her for anything. Then I asked her ""you had 10 years to figure out your credit so why are you trying to hurt mines""?

Today, they both tried to convince me but I still refused. They said that once my stepdad got his papers he would use both my mom and his credit score to refinance the house under both of there names, and I would lose nothing. TBH, that sounded to good to be true and that made me even more skeptical of there plan. They also stated that I would get something out of it but this seems like something that we will fight over and I am not interested in investing in property right now.

If you're wondering, my mom's credit scores isn't that great. The other day she went to a mortgage broker and asked about financing a home under her name. The broker said that she will get refused because her income isn't high enough.

My concern is the number I put into 4c is several hundred dollars, which seems high. Is the W4 assuming I’m the sole income earner for us and adding the amount in 4c to adjust for the fact that my wife does work, or will the amount in 4c be added to what is already being withheld in taxes from my pay stubs with my Single filing status?

2078,personalfinance,"Hello,

I'm being made redundant (being laid off) from my job. This will happen on Monday of next week. I have significant share options vested with the company. It looks like it's going to cost me around $45k to exercise these options and then I will get hit with an income tax bill for the value of those shares minus the exercise price. I expect the income tax bill to be around 175k (I'm in Ireland and I believe its a 52% tax hit total).

This means I will end up paying a little over 200k total after the income tax hits. I don't have anywhere near that money, but if I don't exercise my options then I will lose them in 12 months.

I have no idea what to do. I don't want to lose this potential value that I have worked incredibly hard for over the past 38 months, but I also don't want to pay that massive tax bill when the shares are not liquid (Private company that hasn't done a buy back since 2021).

I live in WA - no state income tax.

The most recent 4-week treasury is earning 3.83%, and right now the ladder is averaging 3.72%. But then I look over at my Vanguard settlement fund - VMFXX - which has a 7 day yield of 4.21%, 4.10% net after the expense ratio. VMFXX seems to good to be true.

Like many of you probably experienced over the last year or so, my 401k, which is managed through a third party investor, is currently losing money and both of my funds are down about 18.3% on the year. Luckily I don't have too much invested just yet, but considering the only reason my balances were increasing was due to contributions, it's incredibly disheartening. 

Background on the funds, I worked for two companies that provided matching programs and I contributed as much as I could afford at the time to the 401k for that employer. When I left my first job for the second, I opened a new 401k but kept the old one to continue growing, but now I'm at a job that offers a pension so I've neglected to contribute to either of my two old plans. I set both of the risk profiles to relatively high, with the understanding that I'm young and I have plenty of time to build my retirement nest egg, and that any potential growth would outweigh short term losses, however with the market as it is right now I'm starting to rethink this strategy. Should I adjust my risk profile to a more conservative investing profile while the market is still so volatile, or should I just ride out the high risk profile until the market starts to rise again?

Also, before anyone mentions it I do intend on a) combining my two former 401ks into an IRA with this provider, and b) I do plan on continuing contributions despite my current company offering a pension, it's just been a busy couple of months since I started my new job!

2119,personalfinance,"I see a lot of calculators and rules of thumb about how much to save and what the total value of retirement savings will be at a certain year, but that doesn't really tell me anything. Sure, a big number looks great on paper, but how much do I actually need? It seems costs of living are highly overestimated. I'm turning 30 in a month and hoping to retire at 60. In the next 30 years, I am going to do a bunch of investment in my future to minimize my bills. By the time I retire, I plan to have the following:

\-Solar on my home that exceeds my total energy use (no electric bill); I will likely replace the solar system right before retirement as it will be close to the end of its useful life, so assume the system is almost brand new

\-Geothermal heating and cooling (no heating bill)

\-Electric vehicle charged by solar and paid off (no car payment or fuel costs, minimal maintenance)

\-Replace roofs and septic tank, possibly well if needed and any other maintenance items (should be good for 30+ years after that)

\-Small garden and perhaps some chickens to offset food costs

\-Several hobbies to fill my free time that will generate small income (CNC plasma table, 3D printer, etc.)

My home is already paid off and will be in great repair prior to retirement. I will have a newer EV that will cost me almost nothing to operate and should last me the rest of my life.

I'm trying to get more on top of my financials this year and had a question about credit card balances. I get paid the day after my statement is due up on the 27th (about $700 if that matters), but I get paid on the 13th as well. I have auto-pay on my credit card that will pay the statement the day before on the 26th. I'd much rather pay it all off on the 13th and not have to worry about stretching the 13th's paycheck to make sure I can cover it.

My question is - if I pay off that balance well before the due date, can safely turn off auto-pay since my balance will be at $0 for that cycle? Credit card debit is scary as hell, and I just want to be extra cautious that I'm not planning on making a stupid move.

2134,personalfinance,"My girlfriend recently received a notice from the IRS (CP2000) indicating that she owes more money on her 2020 tax return ($6,000 tax, $1,000 penalty for significant under-reporting, and $500 interest). Thankfully, this high figure is based on wrong assumptions^(1), and I re-did her taxes properly and it's down to $2,800 and $200 interest.

The instructions on the notice said if we agree, to send a check. If we disagree, to respond in writing. I have the response, along with all new forms and schedules.  

My question is -- now that the [interest is 7%](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/interest-rates-increase-for-the-first-quarter-of-2023) (4% Federal Short Term + 3% fixed), is it wise to send a check for what we believe to be the correct amount + interest? The idea is to stop the interest from accruing even if the IRS wants to counter with other corrections (if any). Or do we just sit and wait... under my assumption interest keeps accruing.

For context, I'm familiar with taxes (IRS VITA volunteer) and am reasonably confident in my new figures for her return. If there is any disagreement with the IRS, it would be small, or they might ask for proof. But it took them 1½ years to send out this notice, I don't want interest on $2,800 (the amount really owed) to be running for another year and a half!

And backup question: should I submit proof, like her 1099-B showing the basis figures? And her medical expenses showing HSA distributions were qualified? I know this isn't an audit, but it shouldn't hurt right?

It would be used as a Waldorf inspired preschool. The reason why I consider this “risky” is because my daycare license is still pending so it could be a few to several months before I’m up and running. Do I snag it now with the possibility of losing thousands of dollars? I do have a significant savings acct that I would be borrowing from and paying myself back once I’m up and running. I’ve been on the lookout for something like this for years otherwise I wouldn’t consider it. 

For example, I realistically might not start until June but would have playgroups planned now to offset some or the cost. Am I a fool for possibly paying $15k to hold this space? Within a couple years it will be a very profitable business (around 12k per month before taxes)

My fiancee's income is below the Roth limit, so she has been making direct Roth contributions for years.  But where we differ is that she also has money in a traditional IRA.  When we get married, our combined income will be above the Roth limit if we file jointly.  

Questions:

1) Can I still make backdoor contributions and avoid her traditional IRA triggering the pro-rata rule for me/us?  From some quick googling it looks like I can, but I would really like to see the IRS guidance or some kind of proof that I will be safe doing this, if anyone can provide it. I have never filed jointly before and really don't want to trigger any kind of penalty.

2) Because our joint income will be above the threshold, my understanding is that she will not be able to make direct Roth contributions anymore if we file jointly. My instinct is that if her traditional IRA amount is relatively small (like a few thousand), it probably makes sense to roll it over and pay the taxes considering the years of backdoor contributions that might be ahead.  Is there anything else I need to think about here? What other factors are there that I should be aware of?  Does the timing of when we roll it over matter?

I'm based in the USA and here's the situation:

My Wife has an HSA from her previous employer in 2021 that we would like to move to a brokerage HSA that's not yet open (Vanguard/Fidelity/etc). Across 2022 she was enrolled in a HDHP plan with HSA at her current employer. However we elected to switch to PPO plan for 2023 for her, and her coverage started Jan 1 (2 days ago). We do not want to roll the 2021 HSA into her 2022 HSA, and instead transfer it to a brokerage HSA (consider it a central HSA for all future job changes versus rolling into new job's HSA). I don't expect her HSA eligibility to come back around until 2024 or 2025 as we need the best HC coverage until then.

Questions:

Can we even open the brokerage HSA now, on Jan 3rd 2023, based on the fact that she is no longer under HDHP plan that ended on 12/31/22 and now under PPO plan? 

What about the fact that it's to be opened to TRANSFER an OLD HSA and not to ""contribute""? 

Was our only option to open the brokerage HSA in 2022 while she was still covered under HDHP?

At my current place, it’s almost impossible. When I started looking for properties, landlords kept asking me to provide a pay stub. Then, I realized that the only good thing about having a job is receiving all the papers required from your employer.

Long story short, a seller I'm familiar with and I've bought from before changed the price of an item I buy frequently and made the price about twice what it used to be. I contacted them about it and they agreed to reduce the price for me, they said if I made an unpaid order they'd edit the price then I could order. 

I went on r/aliexpress and searched on Google and I did every single thing I was ""supposed"" to do to make an unpaid order but the order for some reason still went through. 

I put in my card number correctly, but the CCV and expiration date completely wrong, which according to literally everything I've read, should put your order in the ""unpaid"" category (and my card shouldn't be charged until I manually edit it back to the correct info.) 

But now the order has gone through, it's in the ""paid"" tab not the ""unpaid"" tab, my card was charged, even though my card info was all wrong and I can't afford to pay for the order at that price. 

I'm freaking out right now because I'm low on money to begin with and I can't at all afford to pay the price of the items when they're twice what they used to be. But now the order went through even though it shouldn't.

I've contacted the seller and they all they can do now is refund me once I receive the order. But shipping is very slow from this site and I don't want to wait over a month to ever see that money again. 

I canceled the order, but now I'm worried I'll never see that money again. It's extremely sketchy that it went through in the first place and since some of the info was wrong I'm afraid they'll say the refund was ""unable to be completed"" or something.

2167,personalfinance,"Hello everyone,
I sold my first house back in September of 2021 and was able to reap 3x profits without paying any taxes on capital gains. This has raised my liquid asset close to $500K. 
I've been living in Europe close to 10 years and took interest in purchasing a property from a dear friend in Germany. Proactively, I converted $200k into euros when the dollar and euro where 1:1. Unfortunately, things didn't work out as plan and I will no longer be purchasing any property in Europe.
Wanting to put the rest of my money to work, I created my first investment porfolio with $170K. I intend to hold it for the long run to profit from its dividends payouts.
Lastly, I dumped $30K on 'I Bonds' (three family members, $10K each account) when the government was offering 9.62% for six months. I plan to hold these for a maximum of five years.
The remaining balance (Approx. $80K) is sitting in my savings account.

Here's my plan for your evaluation:
The €200K I have will be re-converted to dollars upon my return to the States. That could be as early as this year or in the next six years. As the euro slowly recuperates, this will generate a good return. Of course uncle Sam will want his share. My plan is to transfer the principal amount  I converted and the remaining balance, transfer it in increments under $10k to avoid triggering the IRS.

The investment account was created based on performing dividend aristocrat and king stocks. Is this a good option to produce passive income?

How effectively am I managing my money? Is there a better way to produce better results?
My goal is to build a wealth of $1M dollars within the next 10 years.

Thank you for your time.",I sold my first house. Now what?,1672732151

I am still in college, my parents are going through a very messy divorce and they have multiple properties (mortgages on some) as well as some liquid capital and some other investments (but primarily the properties). Because they could not reach a reasonable settlement, and neither want the other to have it, they want to give anything with joint ownership over to me.

Now I don’t want to take their money, they’re clearly both very unhappy and I want to do the best for them, and make sure they both have a comfortable lifestyle in retirement. Preserving what they have built and not losing too much to this hyperinflation is my goal. I am still a student, and after looking up some basics, it seems like I would have to pretty much immediately liquidate the properties just to pay the taxes, I don’t want to do that. Is there a way to avoid this? My best hope is for some kind of passive income stream. I don’t want to sell them either because it seems like the rent is paying for the mortgage and then some.

I’m really lost as to what to do, I’d like to think I’m good with money but this is a sum of capital entirely out of my pay grade and I'm kinda fried in the brain, both with this news and the divorce. I also want to make sure they both have comfortable living situations and are able to keep relying on this sum without me having to be the arbiter of who gets what, just looking for some advice.

- 2023 Standard employee 401k contribution limit - $22,500
- 2023 Total 401k contribution limit - $66,000
- Employer matches 4% of Total Compensation
- Total Compensation consists of Base+Bonus pay
- Total compensation is unknown until Jan of following year
- Employer match is paid in Jan of following year

Since I don't know what my total compensation will be in 2023 I don't believe I can calculate how much I can contribute exactly. I run the risk of either under or over contributing.

As an example consider:
Base Pay: $100,000
Bonus Pay: $0 - $100,000
Total Compensation: $100,000 - $200,000
Company Match: $4,000 - $8,000

How much should I contribute in 2023? 
66,000 - 22,500 - x = y
x = employer match (unknown in 2023)
y = my after-tax contribution

If I contribute too much, my employer will not be legally allowed to contribute the full match amount and I lose out on money, right? 

PS. My employer has until March 2024 to submit their employer match for taxes occuring in 2023. Since they are paying out the 2023 contribution in 2024 does that technically mean that specific match will count towards the max limit in 2024 instead of 2023? If so, that solves the equation, but since they're submitting it for tax year 2023, it makes me think this is not the case.

I don't agree because right now we have the cheapest rent in the city, our rent is $1k with one bedroom and you don't find rents that cheap in the city unless you move to the country side but the country side is about 1-2hrs away from our jobs. you can find rents slightly cheaper but it is always a studio or just one with no parking. We live in New England so having parking is essential! especially during the winter months.

I told him that i much rather stay here until we have enough money for a house. We don't have too complaints where we live except that living in the city has been eating up our cars because of how bad the roads are, is a smaller place, we managed to get an extra parking spot only because our neighbor only has one car but if he were to get a second car then there's a chance we might have to give up one of our spots.

His argument about saving for a house is that because of how expensive houses are here, it would take us years before we are able to have enough for a house. so he figures why not spend that money at a better apartment. We thought of maybe moving to the south since houses are much cheaper but at the same time we don't want to.

I am a little conflicted because it would be nice to live somewhere nice but i am also thinking of the future. we are in our late 20s, no kids and our combined income is about $140k",Stay in cheaper apartment or move to something better?,1672716767

2206,personalfinance,"Early in 2022, my wife asked for a deferral that would give her the max $20,500 contribution to her 401k. This was working fine initially but we unfortunately just noticed that in July they stopped making the deferral. (Our mistake for noticing so late…). Apparently their payroll system incorrectly flagged that she had reached the maximum after $10,260. They’ve admitted to the mistake and say it’ll be fixed going forward but that doesn’t make us whole for their mistake.

The missed deferral brings our MAGI up to where we have to reduce our Roth IRA contributions, so this has implications beyond just the missed pre tax contributions this year.

I’m not very happy to accept “oops our bad but nothing to do.” But I’m unclear what we can ask for them to do. Can they make corrections on the last few paychecks with near 100% deferral (and we send them the money)? It seems like if they can’t fix it they might owe us QNEC money but I’m not clear on that and honestly I’d rather a fixed deduction due to the tax implications. We’ve made it difficult on ourselves given we didn’t discover until the end of the year and so no more 2022 paychecks to fix it with.

2227,personalfinance,"TL;DR: Parents are paying $700+/month for car insurance, thanks to two brand new drivers and a recent accident. Is this the rate we should expect?

I'm a 21-year-old driver living with my parents (late 40s) and my brother (18). My parents own a 2020 Expedition, 2014 Edge, 2006 F-150 (paid off), and a 2001 Ranger (paid off). My parents currently pay over $700 a month for car insurance through USAA. I believe it's the full amount of coverage offered. My brother and I only became licensed three months ago, and two months ago I totaled a previous car we had in a collision that was my fault.

Obviously, all of this would naturally add up to a pretty high rate. It's a lot of vehicles, with two brand new drivers and a recent collision on record. With that in mind, is $700+ a ""reasonable"" monthly premium, or is it still absurdly high given the circumstances? I want to suggest to my parents that they at least get a smaller level of coverage, but the full coverage really saved our asses in replacing the car I crashed. Supposedly my mother has shopped around a bit and was not able to get any lower quotes, but I don't know how in-depth her search was. She says she can't find better rates, and doesn't think anyone would be willing to insure us anyway so soon after an accident.

The situation worries me a lot. With the insurance and two car loans combined, our cars are eating so much of my parents' income that I'm afraid it might be untenable. What can we do to mitigate the costs? Do we need to shop around more, reduce our coverage, or just ride it out until my brother and I have longer driving records and/or move out of the house?

Side note: Personally, I think the biggest culprit is probably the 2020 Expedition, but it's been an extremely hard sell getting my parents to consider swapping it for a cheaper car.

2239,personalfinance,"I am a tradesman in my early 20s looking for the right budget app. I mention I am a tradesman because my hours can be inconsistent, especially in the winter. The app that would best suit me deals in percentages. Here is what I am thinking...

I want to set spending allowance based on percentage of hours I input. For example, lets say I add up all my necessities (rent, bills, loan payment, ect.) and it is $1000 (For easy math). Based on my average spending of less specific expenditures like groceries, water, electric, ect. that most likely can't be determined to the exact dollar amount I can create an ""allowance"" for everything else besides those necessities. Then I want 10% to go to savings, 15% into retirement, 10% in to investments ... ect. So if I work 8 hours a day, when I log those hours I want the money to be dispersed by the amount of time I have to be able to afford that expense. So if I buy groceries once a week (I get paid weekly) then immediately, my grocery allowance will be ""filled"" based on my average spending to eat for the next week.Things like rent, that are monthly, can then be split between, lets call it 4 weeks of pay, equally after my immediate things are paid for.

The math would look like this... 

8 hours of work a day - insurance and taxes = Income

Income - ($1000 / 4) = Share given to necessities divided by time

Income x .10 = Share to savings

Income x .15 = Share to investments

Income x .20 = Share to intangibles

(This is just an example so i don't care to allocate the full 100% after necessities)

Now the main goal i want out of this is to divide up the part of each share NOT USED. If I work more than normal, lets say 50 hours, so I have excess then, because I am using percentages, I will have more than I need or want to spend in any given category which I can then move elsewhere or put into savings.

Vice Versa I want to know on weeks I work less than 40 hours how much I have to pull out of reserve or aware from investments ect. It would be better even if the app intentionally drew out of investments to fulfill necessities when necessary. 

It would be great if I can link my accounts as well.

You guys pointed out my rent was too high. You were right. The more I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I got paying 45% of my take-home for rent. I also forgot about social security and medicare being taken out of my gross pay, reducing my take-home.

Simultaneously, I had an out - my landlord had not signed the lease (there were some other issues, not the point), so I got out and started looking for cheaper places. I found one for $500/mo cheaper. 

But I forfeited my $1000 security deposit. It's in the contract that if you apply for a lease but don't end up signing, they keep the deposit. Moving was already so expensive for me. That's 3% of my current income, vanished into thin air.

2282,personalfinance,"Hello,

I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering in 21' and actually ended up taking a gap year to travel the world a bit and see the family with some money saved up during COVID. Now, with my first degree-related job out of school I am making $70,000 a year with 3-15% (8-11% on average) profit-sharing contributions starting **FY24**. I also received an $8,000 signing bonus which is waiting to be used to eliminate a loan. I'll get into my debts and monthly expenses later, but as for retirement options, I will be putting the Roth IRA and maxed-out contributions on the back burner until my high-interest loans disappear. 

My question is, coming from a family that I wouldn't call financially literate, how can I best approach my current student loan situation:

* **Private** \- $5,700 - 11.24% \[$140/mo\]
* **Private** \- $10,500 - 10.63% \[$280/mo\]
* Federal - $4,500 - 5.05% 
* Federal - $2,100 - 5.05%
* Federal - $500 - 5% \[$60/mo\]
* Federal - $5,500 - 4.53%
* Federal - $2,000 - 4.53%
* Federal - $4,400 - 4.45%
* Federal - $2,200 - 4.45%
* Federal - $3,500 - 4.45%
* Federal - $5,500 - 2.75%
* Federal - $2,000 - 2.75%

**Total: \~ $48k**

**Monthly (Net): $4150 - $420 - $60 - ($120 + $120 + $150) = $3,280 -&gt; $3,250**

I give a rough breakdown above, but the only monthly expenses include the gym, gas, and food which sit under $400 total each month. The only major purchases I've made since getting this new job have totaled $2,000 for a new set of tires and some much-needed preventative/maintenance work on the vehicle.

My plan is to pay off the highest interest-rate loan ($5,700 @ 11.24) and one of my federal ($500 @ 5) in the coming week, setting me back $6,200. It would open up $200 from minimum payments which could be stacked elsewhere, along with these bulk payments I've been planning. Is this a fair method or am I looking at this wrong? Is there a certain interest rate (say 5+ percent) that screams pay it off now outside of my two private loans? I've done plenty of research on snowball v. avalanche but I feel like I'd rather have a mix between the two once I move from my private to federal loans in roughly five to six months. The varying values of principle across 2.75-4.53% are my main question mark because I am aware that at a certain point you'd rather save/invest alongside the market rather than aggressively pay off lower-interest loans.

2284,personalfinance,"Long story short, I got into drugs at a young age and lived a pretty reckless life, racking up tons of debt along the way. I've been sober for almost 5 years and over this time I've been trying to repair the damage caused by my addiction. My credit has been something I've continually put on the backburner because, while I understand what it is, I've survived without it and it has made me nervous. Last time I checked Credit Karma, my score was in the low 500s and I had about 3500 in collections. I checked it again a couple days ago and my score was 606 and the only thing on my credit report is $90 in collections. Quite a few of these debts had been accrued over 7 years ago, so I'm assuming the statue of limitations went into effect? Where do I go from here? Should I get ahold of the agency and just pay it? My knowledge on this mind as well be a bag of dirt. The way I've handled this is disappointing, but I want to do better.

2289,personalfinance,"Long time lurker here and I have some questions I will try to be brief with...but there's a lot of info so I'm sorry...

&amp;#x200B;

Little backstory, I finished grad school about 6 months ago and moved to another place where I took a job in my medical field. This job pays me very well and is honestly the first job in my life that I ever made good money. I'm 41 years old, single, have a mountain of student loan debt and have a bit of car loan debt...I currently make about 160k per year with my job as my starting salary.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought the car I have a payment on right after graduating. When I moved here to Portland OR, my car was stolen the first night I was here, and I honestly needed some transportation living in a new city, and found what I thought to be a good deal on a car. I didn't' have a bunch of cash on hand since I had just graduated, so I put down 5k on a 25k used car, and my payments are now $462/mo as I also bought a warranty which I normally would not have done. My interest rate is 7 or 7.9%, I can't remember which, main reason it's high is because the car I bought is a 2011 model year and banks don't like to give good rates for older cars I guess...

&amp;#x200B;

I have no life which is good for me financially, but of course terrible for my mental health. I rent an apartment for about $1700/mo, my power bill is about $30-$70/mo, internet is $80/mo, and I spend about $1700/mo or so on food, fuel, car insurance, and other incidentals of living.

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to save a decent chunk of money after my insurance claim paid me out for my stolen car, plus just banking my pay that I don't spend to live each month. I currently have about 38k in my checking account, and about 2.5k in my savings account. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would have even more, but I've been spending a TON of money on my mother who had a bad stroke at the end of September. Spent some money to fly out and see her when it happened, and then I've spent even more money to take care of her and take care of things for her since she makes very little money from disability retirement as well as death benefit annuity. I'd say I've spent about 5k on her in the past three months, and 4k of that was just in December because I need to now pay for her long term care since she still can't be alone and take care of herself...I will continue to pay at least 3k/mo for her assisted living facility.

&amp;#x200B;

First question, should I pay off my car with the money I have sitting? I've been apprehensive given my new financial situation with my mom, plus I know it's good to have money on hand for an emergency fund etc. If I did pay off my car in one lump sum, I would most likely sell it once I get the title just to be rid of that debt. It has kind of become clear to me that perhaps I don't deserve any nice or fun things right now, and I drove back to Portland after seeing my mom with my free and clear car that I had gifted her after I graduated because I wanted her to have a nicer car because I love my mom of course.

&amp;#x200B;

Second question, if I don't pay off the car right now, what should I do with my money?

&amp;#x200B;

Third question, which is more detailed than the last, should I consult with a financial planner or an accountant to go over my situation and get advice on how to invest to make my money grow for later in life, especially given my late start to the game?

&amp;#x200B;

Further backstory, before I decided to go to school, I worked in law enforcement for six years for the state of AZ and have all my contributions along with the state's contributions to my pension, still with the state of AZ. I decided to leave those funds alone after I left in 2012 because there is still a good death benefit for my mom if something happens to me, the money still makes some interest (although I don't know how much), and when I reach retirement age, it will still pay me several hundred dollars per month if I leave it alone...

I recently started a new job and this is my first time receiving benefits through an employer, so I could use some advice?

I have no preexisting medical conditions and I'm in decent physical health. These insurances being offered are through Unum.

&amp;#x200B;

Voluntary Coverage I can choose:

Hospital Indemnity Insurance - $13.91 per paycheck. Provides $2,000 per covered hospital admission once per year. Provides $100 per day of a covered hospital stay, up to 60 days once per year. Provides $200 per day in intensive care, up to 15 days once per year.

Accident Insurance - $7.19 per paycheck. Covers costs associated with accidental injuries.

Critical Illness Insurance - $4.67 per paycheck for $30,000 of coverage. Covers costs associated with critical illnesses. Can be used every 180 days for recurring conditions, or immediately again for an unrelated second illness.

&amp;#x200B;

The total for all three insurances comes out to $25.77 per paycheck. In theory, these insurances sound like a good idea but I am concerned it may just be a waste of $51 per month and none of the information in my packet lays out which conditions/injuries are covered and which conditions/injuries aren't covered.

1) Open a HYSA that my partner and I can start using to save for bigger purchases (home, car, etc) and that I can also use as a personal emergency fund. (Ally lets you have ""buckets"" so I think keeping things separate will be easy)

1. i have had the same savings account since i was 16, and it is earning me a whopping $0.08 per month with a 10.5k balance. is there a better way that i could be storing this money for emergencies? i want to ensure that i have enough saved in case something goes south, but i would also like to start saving up for an eventual downpayment. i would also like my money to work for me, and $1 per year is not doing that. 

2. i currently have 2k in my roth ira. should i be fully prioritizing my roth ira, or should i continue to split my income between my savings account and my roth ira? i can currently maximize my contribution to my roth ira each month, but in doing so i would not be able to contribute to my savings account regularly.

My boyfriend of 3 years recently purchased a house, originally thinking he  would rent it out but has realized he needs to live in it for at least 1 year for it to be considered his primary residence. He’s moving there in March, and has asked me if I would like to live with him.

If I said yes, we would live there for at least 1 year while I save up money to buy my own house. Then, once I bought my own house we would repeat the same setup and live in mine for at least a year. That way we would each have an asset in our own names before eventually getting married and buying a home together. 

We have talked before about moving in together later this year, so this is an earlier timeline than expected. We are also both very young, 23 and 22. We’re quite serious and marriage has been discussed, but we want to wait until we’re at least 25. 

My main hesitation is that the $1500/mo rent he is requesting is more than I wanted to spend on housing. (I live with my parents currently so I pay $0, but I planned to move out in June to a 2-bedroom with a friend and pay $1300 or less.) However, it’s 28% of my take-home pay so still within general guidelines for rent. On the flip side, I’m paying extra for a lot more square footage and I get to live with the person I love. 

The other main advantage is I don’t love the location. It’s a little over an hour away from my family and friends and I’m afraid of feeling isolated. But I could do it for a year or two. 

Any advice? Does it make sense for him to request 50% of the mortgage ($1500) as rent, or should we negotiate a different setup where I pay for variable expenses like household groceries/supplies/utilities only?

$410k salary

No non-mortgage debts

Long term goal for now is to be able to retire early by my late 30s/early 40s with about $3M-$5M in investments. 

—————-

I live in HCOL area and I currently live in a condo worth about $400k ($75k equity, $325k mortgage @ 3.5% interest). This condo is only about 500 sq ft and I bought it a few years ago. At that time, 500 sq ft was plenty of space but a lot of has changed since then and I feel like I have outgrown the space. For example, I have since gotten a dog and had to build a home office in my bedroom after my work transitioned to WFH (something that I had not anticipated when buying pre-covid)

In order to move up in house, something in the neighborhood of $800k-$1.25M would fit my needs well without having to move excessively far out of the city. Anything cheaper than $800k just isn’t feasible in my area. Problems with under $800k would be things like small size, very expensive HOA fees, bad neighborhoods, excessively far from city, or just old/bad quality.

The biggest cons I’m seeing are that I would be losing my current 3.5% interest rate and would be tying up almost all of my net worth in the house. The rest of my net worth is tied up in my 401k so I would have virtually no savings outside of those vehicles, such as in a taxable brokerage, other than my emergency fund. I currently have about $75k equity in my current home, $50k in a taxable brokerage, and the rest in various retirement accounts (taxable and retirement were much bigger before market downturn). I can save up another $100k easily in 6mon for a $200k downpayment

Hello, I'm planning an 8 month roadtrip, mainly to campsites (trying to live like homeless kinda deal). My budget is $2167 everything included. (My current car payment is $354).

We have a 22k mile Honda hrv, which is too small for the both of us. We tried fitting everything we needed in the car and we're really crammed. Like no room for error. But I guess once we tent we can space our stuff out. We're thinking of removing the back seats to make more space. 

We took a look at the Maverick which really interested us because it is more affordable than most trucks and we found it so convenient and more ideal due to: more space, taller, many more amenities perfect for camping, better off roading possibilities. But current rates suck right now (I would be paying about $200 extra more or less with a $5000 down payment), idk how reliable they are, and I don't want to make a bad financial decision if I know my HRV could ""technically"" get the job done.

Hi all,

I am 24, originally from Ukraine, now I live in the US and have a green card.

I run an online teaching/consulting business that I have been growing for the last 7 years. Last year I made $175K, in 2021 it was $160K, in 2020 $120K. I think if i try hard, I could grow it to $250-300K, but probably it cannot scale beyond that. 

A part is active earned income (about $120 of last year’s 175K) and a part is income from my intellectual copyright property. That part is more or less guaranteed for the next 7-10 years.

Of this $175K, my tax bill is $45000, my spending is $40-45K, and I save the rest ($90 000). 

Here is the problem. I love Europe so much more. I traveled many countries, especially Eastern European ones, and love living there a lot better. And, I have a lot of friends all over Europe, including digital nomads.

Life in the US kind of sucks. It’s okay on a daily level, but the only walkable cities are expensive ones, and I want to stay frugal. Food is worse, entertainment is worse. To enjoy US as much I would enjoy Croatia or Spain, I need to spend exactly 5 times more or so.

My standard of living was higher even in Ukraine 5 years ago with $800 a month. Sure now I can buy a big house or car, but that doesn’t fix entertainment, food or weather. 

So, a part of me wants to move to Europe and surrender my green card. Especially if I could lower my taxes, not only would I save more by spending less, but also by wasting less in taxes! For example if my spending is cut by half with the same or better lifestyle and so is my tax bill (say, Bulgaria with a 10% flat tax), I will be saving $140 000 a year.

But, there are two problems with doing that.

1)Living in Ukraine, I had tremendous financial instrument problems. For example my clients couldn’t pay me cause PayPal wasn’t available, I couldn’t keep money in the bank because they go bankrupt and aren’t insured, I had no access to stock market or mortgages. 

So moving to a country like Montenegro with low taxes won’t solve this, while places like Lithuania, Portugal, or anything EU except a few exceptions are high tax. 

2)Citizenship. I could get a freelancer visa or even a Golden Visa soon, but I would prefer to work on citizenship, because the Ukrainian one is not safe and good enough.


But the biggest problem is my ambition. I am aware I am fortunate to have built this business. It’s amazing that at just 24 years old I could retire in most of the world! 

But, I want much more. I know people here in the US who make $5-10M a year, anywhere from finance to real estate. 

So, if I were to stay, I could start buying real estate. In 5 years, I could build a $3-5M portfolio cash flowing $100-200K a year extra and appreciating.

I think the US is not going to the right place, but it still offers the best protection and money creation tools unless you only build remotely. No other country offers fixed mortgages, you know your money will be safe, there will be no wealth tax, it’s easy to evict tenants. I know the American tax code, rules, laws and mentality and moving to Portugal, Bulgaria, Malta and whatnot will undermine these plans. It will take time to learn the local laws, locals have less money, it’s harder to work with the banks, etc. 

If I had a US citizenship, I would leave the country now, travel and leave in Europe, saving money with Foreign Earned Income Exemption, and would be building my real estate portfolio in the US. I would be coming to oversee the deals, and delegate the management.

So what should I do? The logical thing would be to surrender the green card now, and enjoy my best life. But the ambitious part of me would be very disappointed. I don’t have to be worth $50M in 15 years, but I know I have to be able to tell myself I did my best. 

Maybe start buying real estate and in 3.5 years take the citizenship and leave? If my earned income goes up so much that the US taxes become a problem, I would then renounce the citizenship and pay an exit tax.",Help choose the direction,1672684733

So a little background, I am 20 years old, I work in commission sales and make a bit over $100k/year. My monthly expenses total out to at or below $4k (typically closer to $3500). I have zero debt so no car payment and credit cards are paid in full every month. I am maxing out my Roth IRA and always have money left over even on bad sales months when I may only make $5-6k. My emergency fund is fully funded, if not a bit over funded. I like to have an extra cushion in my finances since I’m on commission. I’m sitting on about $35k in cash and about $10k in investments (and growing) so far. 

Now my question is this:
 
The gym has been a passion of mine for a long time. I have set some fairly massive income goals for this year and want to keep myself on track. I went with one of the older gentlemen I work with to the incredibly fancy gym he goes to and absolutely loved the experience. It has *everything* there from a massive area to lift weights, to a sauna, cold plunge, rooftop lap pool, cafe, massage room, etc etc. 

The downside is, it costs $200/ month. I know I can feasibly afford this, that’s no worry but I am struggling to justify it to myself no matter what. It is in a wealthy area and I am certainly a believer that if you want money you need to surround yourself with people who have money, and I think this is certainly a place where that applies. But besides that I do think it would benefit me to be able to have that trip everyday to a luxurious area of town and enjoy my workout / sauna &amp; cold plunge.

I was using an online calculator yesterday and saw an ad for High Yield Savings accounts (Ally, Capital One, etc.) I noticed that most of the rates were between 3% and 4%. I know that Capital One has variable rates, but have neglected to keep tabs on the interest rate, so I thought that it was good that they're keeping pace with other banks (I joined ING, and when Capital One Acquired them, they weren't as good about keeping interest rates competitive.)

When I checked my Savings accounts, they were only paying a 0.3% interest. I checked them all, and reached out to a friend to confirm that I was reading it right - he had the same rate.

So I recently had to return my car and the dealership explained that buying it would be my best option for lowest payments. I thought OK let's do this because I need a car anyway. Car was leased under my mom's name because she had better credit at the time. So the salesman tells me it has to be bought under her name to qualify for the 0 down buying option. I figure no big deal, I'll have her come sign the papers. He tells me the final number is looking like 590 a month! I ask why and he says her credit is too low and she was financed at 18%. I'm panicking but I need a car, and the lease options are higher than that so I say OK.. thinking I can sell the car in a few months and see what to do then. I'm an idiot I know, but I've also got my 2 kids with me, one of which is a baby and I'm juggling all of this so my brain is just telling me to finish this up. 

My mom comes and I need to get the baby changed so I tell her I haven't read the itemized pricing yet so don't sign that. She says OK she'll do that last. Well she signed anyway. Apparently the salesman just got her to sign all the papers quickly since the price was agreed upon. At this point there is no turning back. My lease end price was 17k and somehow between the mileage charge and dealership fee and other shit it ended up at 25k! How the fuck? 

So I'm stuck financing a 25k car at 18% interest. I WANT TO CRY. I don't know what to do because the contract clearly states there is no cooling off period, meaning once it's signed, it's binding. Am I going to have to sell this shit and take the hit of the difference? Like if I sell it for 20k I'm only on the hook for the other 5k? Or is the interest also due at once?

2419,personalfinance,"Hey y’all, I’ve been around this sub for a year or two now, and have been largely supporting myself &amp; my finances. I’ve taken a lot of advice from threads in here so thank you all!

It has come to the point where I am a bit confused and in the middle of deciding whether to continue to invest in a Roth 401k (which I have been doing since graduating), and a Traditional 401k, which I believe I should start taking advantage of.

As of the end of 2022, here’s where I am:
- Age: 25
- Living: IL (4.95% state income)
- $153k Salary
- $130k NW: $30k HYSA (big purchases soon), $20k brokerage, $60k Roth’s, $10k Traditionals, $10k other (crypto, bonds, HSA, etc)

Future plans:
- Will likely marry in next 3 years, new combined income will be $225k+
- Expecting personal salary increase in 2023 to $165k+

I plan on maxing out 401k contributions in 2023. 

Based on everything I’ve read, I believe I am very close to being better suited for a traditional account because of my low(er) state income, high(er) tax bracket, and a large enough safety net of Roth when needed for larger distributions in retirement. However, some posts here have recommended that the 28%+ tax brackets are where traditionals help, and I’m also at a loss of trying to understand since I am so heavily invested how much my distributions will need to be in retirement. 

With this - I am leaning towards a 60/40 Roth/Traditional split, but am not super confident in this decision. I do believe a split of some sort is going to be right.

Now, I'd like to continue to sell off some more losses across VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBILX, but had some questions:

Unfortunately I didn't know the previous 30 days also impacted wash sale rules, and had auto re-invest on these funds, which mean some small amounts of shares came reinvested in December. I also have these same funds in my Roth and Rollover IRA accounts in vanguard.

What's the best way to handle this? 

1. Just sell anyway and let vanguard deal the wash sale shares on the tax form? (not sure how much this would complicate my taxes using TaxAct). I'd also need to make sure I understand how to carry forward the correct amount in the future that weren't qualified. (I'm not a tax expert and do my own taxes with TaxAct so this can get overwhelming for me)

2. Using specID in vanguard, I could not sell any of those shares from the last 30 days and wait to do that later?

3. Either way I guess I have to also turn off auto-reinvest in my retirement accounts as well for now?

UGH this is all way harder than it should be. What approach would you go with that's easiest? Just sell it all now and take the wash sale hit on those small amount of shares or try to time it 30 days from now?

2428,personalfinance,"Hi! F22 here. Graduated college last year, moved back home, and have been a bit out of control with spending. I want to go into the new year with a better plan. I read the wiki and tried to put a budget together. 


My salary is $85,000 and I’ve been taking home roughly $5,100 monthly after taxes. I started working in September 2022.


Monthly expenses with new 2023 budget and a few explanations after:


|Category|2022|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rent|$400|$400|
|Car|$540|$540|
|Car Insurance|$100|$100|
|Phone|$105|$105|
|Gas|$150|$150|
|Groceries|$300|$400|
|Fast Food/Restaurants/Coffee|$415|$75|
|Clothes|$800|$150|
|Dry Cleaning/Tailor|$50|$20|
|Fun (Department Stores/Plants/Books)|$300|$100|
|401K|N/A|$212|
|Roth IRA|N/A|$540|
|Total|$3160|$2792|


**Rent:** I live at home, but pay my family $400 monthly for my bedroom. 


**Car:** The car I’m driving now is technically not mine. It’s in my family’s name and the understanding is that it’s “mine” as long as I pay the monthly payments and eventually give them more for the “equity” I’m getting in it. 


It’s a 2015 4Runner with 95k miles. It’s completely decked out and worth $23-25k. My family has a 2.3% loan on it with $5,100 left. They want an additional $7,500 for them to officially sell it to me. 


I love the car and think it’ll be a great vehicle for me to drive until the wheels fall off. I’m not sure what the best strategy is in terms of financing it in my name (interest rates are quite high rn), so for the time being I’ve been paying their monthly payments and at some point will need to take out a loan. Any input here is appreciated!


**Food:** The $380 on eating out is partially me eating out a few times a week. It’s also a mix of me paying weekly to take my siblings out to eat and I’ve also had a few expensive meals. I took my dad to a nice dinner for his birthday ($200) and paid for my entire family on my grandmother’s birthday ($300). I enjoy taking my siblings out and want to continue, but limit to once a month or so this upcoming year. 


**Clothes:** I have gone overboard here. I work in a somewhat formal setting and didn’t have a decent wardrobe. I got several expensive silk blouses, wool pants, expensive shoes, backpack, and suitcase. This definitely was just an upfront cost thing and I don’t plan to be spending this much monthly here on out. 


**Other Comments:** I pulled all of my credit card transactions to make this monthly breakdown. It doesn’t completely add up to what I’ve taken home. I’ve combined a few things here and there, I have around $7,000 in my savings account right now. My company matches 25% of the first 6% for 401k. I also don't currently have a Roth IRA but plan to open one soon.


**Student Loans:** I have $27,000 in federal student loans and my family has a $12,500 parent plus loan I'll pay. These are all on deferment until August 2023.


||Amount|Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Personal Federal|$5,640|5.05%|
|Personal Federal|$6,532|4.53%|
|Personal Federal|$7,500|2.75%|
|Personal Federal|$7,500|3.73%|
|Parent Plus|$12,500|6.28%|


**Future Goals:** I feel overall pretty aimless in life right now. I want to feel more in control of my finances and have goals I'm working toward. I would love to take my family on a trip somewhere, start saving heavily for a down payment on a small house/condo. I am not sure how long I will plan to live at home, but think if I play my cards right it can help set me up for success down the road.

Either a Honda CRV Hybrid Sport 2WD or Toyota RAV4 Hybrid AWD (all Rav4 hybrid are all wheel drive, but I don't particularly need AWD). 

I have located a Honda dealer willing to sell an inbound CRV at MSRP 33695 + 995 dealer fee + tax/tags/etc. 

I have located a Toyota dealer willing to order from allocation a RAV4 at MSRP from their pipeline; unsure if any have factory accessories or packages, but the RAV4 without anything is 33570. This dealer has no fees, no markups, etc. Sticker + tax/tags/etc.  

Neither dealer can quote rates because it will depend what is offered at the time the vehicle actually arrives.  Rates are a little stupid now in general, but I should qualify for whatever the lowest offered is.  hoping to be somewhere around 5-6% on a 60 month loan. 

I would put 0 down, am not trading in my 2006 Honda. 

With taxes, fees, license, registration, it seems like I would be financing 36K and with an interest rate of 6% be paying right around $700 per month for total of payments after 5 years coming to approx 42K.  

Household income (myself and wife): $134,000 base up to 164,000 (part of my pay is variable commission plan).

Other income: **$1300 month dividends** but currently set to DRIP instead of using as income

I also am **reimbursed 62.5 cents per mile that I drive for work**. My current vehicle averages 20 mpg, the new hybrids are both approx 35 mpg, so my cost to operate them drops .  I can drive anywhere from 100 - 400 miles per week for work, but let's use 200 as an average. 800 miles per month is $500 reimbursed.  Fuel cost for 800 miles at 35 MPG and $3.50 per gallon is $80. My net reimbursement to cover car cost/depreciation/maintenance would therefore be about $420 per month. 

Cash accounts: $205K

Debt / Obligations

* Mortgage 245K at 2.625%. Insurance is insane on the house. PITI is **$2000** month. 
* Wifes car; 2020 Toyota financed at 2.99%.  Owe $12.5k on it, car has a fair market value of 20-22k, so no rush to pay faster.  Payment is **$410** per month currently
* Other expenses: Household bills (lawn care, electric, water company, pest control, cable, etc) **$400**
* FL Prepaid university/UTMA investing/529 savings contribution - **$300** 
* Groceries - **$500** 
* Car Insurance (paid 2x per year); 3 cars = **$500** per month combined.  

So that's a **little over $4000 per month in obligations**; maybe can save a bit on groceries, or step down the UTMA and 529 contributions (not likely to do so) but overall, not much we can do to alter our monthly ""nut"".  

Is $700 a month for a new vehicle payment within our range or is it irresponsible/unaffordable? Is it time to retire the 2006 Honda, or try to go another year or two?

As I understand the IRS rules, each person has an annual gift tax exclusion amount for “present interest” gifts to each non-spouse recipient (16,000 in 2022 and $17,000 in 2023).  However, there is a $0 limit on “future interest” gifts to non-spouse recipients, and you must file a gift tax return when you give “future interest” gifts to anyone except your spouse. 

It’s not clear to me whether I-Bonds you purchase as a gift for a non-spouse individual (using their SSN and TD account #) in 2022 but hold for delivery to that individual in 2023 count as a “present interest” gift in 2022 or a “future interest” gift in 2023.

The original goal being to save up £10k between my partner and I to go towards nursery fees/ baby expenses by the time the baby is born.  I will have 6 months paid maternity leave from work so don’t need to worry too much about maternity leave, and most baby stuff we’ll be getting second hand/ getting some money from relatives so don’t need too much extra ££ for that as we can probably cover with our salaries.

However now that I have a sizeable chunk saved I’ve been looking at my student loan repayments and thinking…imagine having that extra £450 per month. I would really feel that - it would really cushion the blow with future nursery fees AND if I had it by the time I go on maternity leave I could potentially stretch my pay out for 9 months rather than 6.

So now I’m thinking, what’s the point of saving for the future when I could be overpaying student loan now and increase my salary by 10%?

So should I pay the £2.5k saved directly into my student loan and continue to divert £500/month to that instead, with a view to pay it off by the time I go on maternity leave in July? Leaving me with an extra £450pm from then onwards?

Other option is to continue saving £500pm in my 5% interest account until I reach the 5k limit.",Save £500pm in 5% interest savings account or pay off student loan (UK),1672678396

2457,personalfinance,"Hey all,

I made a bit of an error 3 days ago (12/30) when paying my Amex credit card bill online for a card I seldom use. When I was using the Amex app to make the payment ($30), I had noticed my saved checking account wasn't showing up. No biggie, I'll just enter it again. This is where I messed up by accidentally omitting one digit of my account number. The routing number was fine, since it showed the correct bank associated with my account. I had only noticed the error after I submitted the payment. At this point, I figured it'd probably just bounce since it's likely not a valid account. However, the Amex online system now shows the payment as ""paid"" (no funds were taken by amex from my account). So I call Amex to see if I can get the payment reversed and refunded since I'd assumed it was a real account that was debited. However, the support rep processes the refund to my actual account, and not to the ""fake/mistake"" account number that I erroneously inputted. I'm now being told that I have to wait a few business days before processing another credit refund. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that phone call I figure I might as well call my bank and see if they can help. My bank has an automated phone system that requests your account number when calling. Turns out, if you enter an account number that's invalid/not associated with an account, the automated system says ""it could not find an account with that number"" or something along those lines. When you enter a valid account number, it instead prompts you to enter your pin to access account information. Out of curiosity, I enter the number I had erroneously entered for payment to see what my bank's system would say, and it says it couldn't find an account with that number. So assuming the number I entered into the phone system was the ""fake/mistake"" number I made payment with, why would Amex mark it as ""paid"" when the payment was made with an invalid account.

Basically, I want to trade my 18JKU in for a 2023 JLU, this particular JLU has every bell and whistle my JKU doesn’t… it only has 25 miles on it, it is completely updated and up-fit with a factory Mopar kit (lift, wheels, shocks, tires etc) all the stuff I would normally do myself. Done and covered under factory warranty. It’s beautiful and mint and again…  brand spanking new.

I’ll get to the meat and potato’s already … I am considering a balloon loan - it’s the only thing holding me back from pulling the trigger. Why a balloon loan? The monthly on a regular finance would have me looking at very high monthly payments which doesn’t fit into my budget. Right now I finance my used car at $447 a month (just for comparison sake)  I put a small hold on the car on NYE and now I’ve just been thinking and thinking. I have nearly an 800 credit score as of today. While I sat at the dealership spitballing and sharing stories, I was informed that I was approved for a monthly payment through a CU for $431 dollars a month, which is less than what I pay now, the interest rate is %6.99 (I know that’s high but was expecting higher considering the state of the world) at the end of the balloon I would owe a little over 24k since the car comes out to 52k after all is said and done with the positive equity of my current vehicle trade value etc.

My thing is I tend to think on the catastrophic scale like, what if I lose my job and can’t find another? What if I fall into ill health, what if I can’t meet that 24k balloon in 5 years? My girlfriend understands my hesitation, at the same time she tells me “the positive is it’s a brand new car, yours already has had issues, and if everyone lived worrying about the future they’d never do anything in the now… also, we know the Wrangler would sell given their reputation, resale value and fan base.”

I know before the balloon comes within five years of saving (if I don’t get fired or something bad happens) that I’d have the money to pay it off if I continue the path I am on… but again - what if something happens. The salesman gave me his shtick of how his girlfriend balloons every 2-3 years with her Wrangler. Sure. But even if I have the 24k all saved up nice and warm what if I don’t want to dump that hard saved money into the final balloon payment?? I could refinance - yes… I could potentially sell the car, yes… but all these questions. Plainly put, is this balloon loan a dumb a** idea? Am I  going to ruin my finances? Is it going to destroy my credit that I work so diligently to maintain and protect? Should I just walk away? I know at the end of the day the final choice is mine… but man, I need advice. My cousin in law who is a good 20+ years older than me and has bought and sold and financed and has more experience with this said “it’s not really beneficial but whatever you choose to do I support you.” So I don’t have much going except the voice in my head saying “do it!

- Directing $13k in my Roth 401k to account for the $6.5k each my wife and I would have put in a Roth IRA
- Putting my remaining 401k in the regular 401k
- Increasing my wife’s 401k contribution to an amount that keeps our total pre-tax 401k contribution in 2023 the same as 2022.

I, 47m and my wife, 44, have been aggressively paying off our debt after a lifetime of financial irresponsibility (Credit Card Debt). Our household income is $180,000, and we each have about $100,000 in our 401ks. My 401k is maxing out due to being a teacher, and my wife is currently contributing up to the employer match, which is 6%.

We have stayed consistent over the last 2 years and have paid off approximately $60,000 in debt, with an additional boost of $100,000 due to my PSLF going through.

We are looking to finish paying off debt while investing in our future/retirement. This is what I have planned at the moment, and I’m curious if there is anything that would be better:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Finish paying $10,000 personal loan (Exp. Completion 3/23)

2. Pay off wife’s $36,000 student loan (Exp. Completion 1/24)

This leaves us with a $1300 a month house payment for 13 years

3. Build 3 months savings in HYSA (Exp. Completion 5/24)

4. Open and Max Contribute to Roth IRA for each of us (Starting May/24)

5. Start saving monthly (HYSA) for max lump payment for following year's Roth IRA contributions

6. Max out my wife’s 401k over the employer match (I think up to 12%)

7. Open a (60%-20%-20%) three-fund portfolio with VTSAX ($9000), VBTLX ($3000), and VTIAX ($3000) (Exp. Completion 5/25)

8. Pay $1000 a month into three fund portfolio at $600-$200-$200 (Starting 8/25)

At this point I would be 49 years old.

9. Start paying off house (at this point I would owe approximately $118,000 at 2.99%)

&amp;#x200B;

Part of my struggle is, do I want the independence of having my house paid off sooner instead of investing earlier? I want my investments to have some time to grow, but the prospect of not having a house payment is attractive.

2523,personalfinance,"What is cash-out refinancing?

If you have equity in your home and need cash, you may be able to refinance your mortgage and get cash out. This is called a “cash-out” refinance.  


To be eligible for a cash-out refinance, you’ll need to have good credit and enough equity in your home. The amount of equity you have is the difference between the balance of your mortgage loan and the appraised value of your home.  


The new mortgage loan you’ll get from a cash-out refinance will be larger than your current mortgage loan. You’ll use the extra money to pay off other debts, make home improvements, or invest in something else.  


Before you decide to do a cash-out refinance, make sure you understand all the costs involved and weigh the pros and cons carefully.

## Pros and cons of cash-out refinancing

If you’re a homeowner with equity in your property, cash-out refinancing allows you to tap into that equity and receive cash in hand. It’s one way to use your home equity, but it’s not always the best option.  


There are some pros to cash-out refinancing, including the potential to:  


• Get a lower interest rate: If rates have gone down since you first took out your mortgage, you could save money by refinancing at a lower rate.  


• Reduce your monthly payments: If you’re struggling to make ends meet each month, lowering your payments can give you some breathing room.  


• Pay off high-interest debt: If you have credit card debt or other loans with high interest rates, you can potentially save money by using the cash from your refinance to pay off those debts.  


However, there are also some cons to consider before taking out a cash-out refinance, including:  


• You could end up owing more than your home is worth: If housing prices go down after you take out a cash-out refinance, you could find yourself “underwater” on your mortgage – owing more than your home is worth. This can make it difficult to sell or refinance if you need to do so in the future.  


• There are closing costs involved: As with any type of loan, there are closing costs associated with a cash-out refinance. These can add up

[https://mortgagedrill.com/cash-out-refinancing-is-one-way-to-turn-your-home-equity-into-cash-but-not-everyone-qualifies/](https://mortgagedrill.com/cash-out-refinancing-is-one-way-to-turn-your-home-equity-into-cash-but-not-everyone-qualifies/)

## How to qualify for cash-out refinancing

To qualify for a cash-out refinance, you’ll generally need to get your home appraised. The appraisal is an important part of the equation because it determines the maximum value of your home and, as a result, how much equity you have.  


In addition to needing equity, you’ll need to prove that you can make the monthly payments on your loan. Lenders will want to see proof of income, employment history, and credit score. They’ll also want to know what your current debts are and your debt-to-income ratio.  


If everything looks good and you’re able to meet all the requirements, you should be able to qualify for a cash-out refinance.

## Alternatives to cash-out refinancing

If you’re looking to access your home equity but don’t qualify for a cash-out refinance, there are a few other options available to you.  


Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) provide flexible access to funds, allowing you to borrow only what you need and making interest-only payments on the amount borrowed. However, HELOCs typically come with variable interest rates, so your monthly payments could increase or decrease over time.  


Another option is a home equity loan, which is a lump sum of cash that’s repaid over a fixed period of time at a fixed interest rate. Home equity loans can be used for one-time expenses like home renovations or debt consolidation.  


Finally, if you have good credit and enough equity in your home, you may be able to get a cash-out refinance with a private lender. Private lenders usually offer higher interest rates than banks or credit unions, but they may be more flexible with their eligibility requirements.","Cash-out refinancing is one way to turn your home equity into cash, but not everyone qualifies",1672654785

2541,personalfinance,"I was recently introduced to the Texas County District and Retirement System. This is a retirement savings plan offered to Texas government employees at all levels across the state. 

As far as I can tell, it seems to be essentially a fixed annuity. But I’m not clear beyond that. A few of my questions are: 

- Am I correct in characterizing this as an annuity?
- Assuming it is a fixed annuity, is it offered through insurance companies (like a typical annuity), or backed by the Texas government itself? 
- When is employer matching applied? At vesting, or at retirement? 
- When electing to “begin retirement”, if I chose not to take the regular payments and instead rolled a lump-sum disbursement of the account into an IRA, would that sum include the employer match? 

Right now, I am imagining the following: if I am fully vested, my employer match is 225%, I currently have $100,000 in my account, and I elect to begin my retirement benefits, then at that time my (now previous) employer adds an additional $225,000 to my account. That brings my total balance to $325,000, which either (a) becomes the basis for calculating the fixed payment lifetime benefit, or (b) becomes available to me as a lump sum (if I so choose) that I can roll over into an IRA and continue to invest myself.

2543,personalfinance,"Background:

22 years old
Just graduated college
Zero debt
Savings of ~$50k (Full access to additional several hundred thousand dollars from parents)
I am an only child who will likely inherit $5-8 million
Career - Making $230k this year scaling up to around $400k in year 4 and $1m+ by year 8. The caveat is that while I am guaranteed a job for the first 4 years, it becomes harder to climb the pyramid as the levels progress. I am a top performer among the peers my age, however I have only been working for a few months so this is meaningless. The downside scenario in my career path is burning out into a different industry and making low-mid-six-figures (300-600k).
I am on track to save about $80-90k this year and will save more in every following year as salary increases. I live in a HCOL area
Long term plans with girl I’ve been dating for 7 years who is in med school who will also 0 debt, also an only child probably inheriting $30-40m

Future Goals:

We have no current desire to FIRE or retire early. I want to work as long as possible and build generational wealth, or simply make as much money as possible. Ideally, We’d like to retire with ~$60-80mm, counting the inheritances. I understand that I am only 22 and very naive. However, the industry I work in is pretty rigorous (80-100 hour work weeks) and it is said that most people figure out if they like it or not within the first few months on the job. I love it. And the hours only get better as you climb up the ladder. She is a 3rd year in med school and very confident in her career path.

My question to the people on here is how to approach this. I see a lot of posts on this subreddit about people in difficult financial situations and very few about building wealth. In terms of savings, We’re just going to pour it all in index funds. I do not have the time or willpower to manage real estate, and the benefits of real estate only become significant for very high earners and UHNW individuals. Is there any other advice people who have taken a similar approach to their finances (building generational wealth) can provide? When I do the math in excel, with my and my future spouses incomes, my goal seems extremely feasible , perhaps even too easy. However, obviously, very few people retire with 60-80 million so I’m curious what I’m missing. On the kids front, we do want kids and I understand that kids are extremely expensive.

Or would it make more sense to have a Roth IRA along with my checking and savings account to begin with and avoid a separate index fund?

My salary is $85,000 and I’ve been taking home roughly $5,100 monthly after taxes. I started working in September 2022. 

Monthly expenses with a few explanations after:

&amp;#x200B;

|Category|2022|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rent|$400|$400|
|Car|$540|$540|

|401K|N/A|$212|
|Roth IRA|N/A|$540|
|Total|$3160|$2792|

**Rent:** I live at home, but pay my family $400 monthly for my bedroom. 

**Car:** The car I’m driving now is technically not mine. It’s in my family’s name and the understanding is that it’s “mine” as long as I pay the monthly payments and eventually give them more for the “equity” I’m getting in it. 

It’s a 2015 4Runner with 95k miles. It’s completely decked out and worth $23-25k. My family has a 2.3% loan on it with $5,100 left. They want an additional $7,500 for them to officially sell it to me. 

I love the car and think it’ll be a great vehicle for me to drive until the wheels fall off. I’m not sure what the best strategy is in terms of financing it in my name (interest rates are quite high rn), so for the time being I’ve been paying their monthly payments and at some point will need to take out a loan. Any input here is appreciated!

**Food:** The $380 on eating out is partially me eating out a few times a week. It’s also a mix of me paying weekly to take my siblings out to eat and I’ve also had a few expensive meals. I took my dad to a nice dinner for his birthday ($200) and paid for my entire family on my grandmother’s birthday ($300). I enjoy taking my siblings out and want to continue, but limit to once a month or so this upcoming year. 

**Clothes:** I have gone overboard here. I work in a somewhat formal setting and didn’t have a decent wardrobe. I got several expensive silk blouses, wool pants, expensive shoes, backpack, and suitcase. This definitely was just an upfront cost thing and I don’t plan to be spending this much monthly here on out. 

**Other Comments:** I pulled all of my credit card transactions to make this monthly breakdown. It doesn’t completely add up to what I’ve taken home. I’ve combined a few things here and there, I have around $7,000 in my savings account right now. My company matches 25% of the first 6% for 401k. I also don't currently have a Roth IRA but plan to open one soon. 

**Student Loans:** I have $27,000 in federal student loans and my family has a $12,500 parent plus loan I'll pay. These are all on deferment until August 2023. 

||Amount|Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Personal Federal|$5,640|5.05%|
|Personal Federal|$6,532|4.53%|
|Personal Federal|$7,500|2.75%|
|Personal Federal|$7,500|3.73%|
|Parent Plus|$12,5000|6.28%|

I would love to take my family on a trip somewhere, start saving heavily for a down payment on a small house/condo.

I read this review about it not affiliated with them and I wanted to get some opinions on it if anyone has it. I've heard they were in the news for having this ""guarantee approval"" on this card they were pushing out and the feds got on them due to it supposedly not affecting someone's credit score when in truth it was(guess they said in their email it was a soft check but it was a hard one] and reflected poorly on people's credit reports which should not have happened to begin with. I wasn't sure if they would still be up and running, didn't want to put $into it if that could happen..my concerns were all there. But the no fees and no balance issue sounds really nice. I am so horrible at balancing my checkbook and the last time I had a bank account, I had one with so many fees$30 for overdraft $30for overdrafts account above $10. What do you all think?

Age 42; married; wife does not earn income; older kids from wife's first marriage (she's 12 years older than me) but they are out of the house and require no support.

Salary: $220k base with bonus between $8k-10k; 3% 401k match; employee plus spouse gold healthcare plan paid 100%.

Mortgage: $366k mortgage (FMV $515k) at 2.75% (1 year into 30-year refinance we did last year to get that rate); $2,154 monthly payment with $622 of that going to escrow.

Student loans: $107k at 6%; $10k at 7%; $18k at 4.45%.

Savings: $35k in traditional savings account.

Retirement: $6k in 401k; $6k in Acorns account (aggressive); $1k in Fidelity traditional IRA (spread among a few Vanguard funds).

Current savings plan is:

\- maxing out 401k ($22,500) to get employer match ($6,600);

\- maxing out traditional IRA ($6,500) and backdooring to Roth at the end of every year;

\- putting $2,600/month into Acorns account.

Please assume that the above is the maximum my current budget will allow.  The student loan payments are paused so it's easy to not bother with those at the moment, but when the resume, obviously it makes sense to start paying those down as aggressively as possible, shifting the entire $2600/month from Acorns into those payments.

Goal: to retire between 60-65 with $2M or more.  The ""or more"" is flexible based on the retirement year since the earlier I go the longer I'll have to float before I draw social security.  My preliminary plan is to wait until 70 to get the max.

My questions:

\- Would it be better to pay the mortgage down or to continue buying as the market falls with the expectation that we'll see the upswing as we did following 2008?

\- Shifting the $35k I have in savings into an online high interest savings account is a no-brainer, right?

\- How would you game out a retirement savings plan based on the above numbers?

The goal seems achievable, but I'm very much a novice as to all saving and investing options, so I want to see if I'm missing anything obvious (or not so obvious).

Some family members and friends told me they think that if I am able to do the payments, my best option would be to try and get a newish slightly used or a brand new car, and that would be the best option for this situation.

Does anyone here have any idea what the best option would be in my situation? I can't afford to wait or try to shop around, I need a car right away. I'm posting this in multiple places because I am hoping I can get as much input as possible, since I don't really have a whole lot of help in my personal life.

Happy New Year!
       I'm posting this here because I frankly think this topic deserves some sort of place within both financial goals and student loan debt considerations.I am currently 44 y.o., single, with no kids and need to return to school for a bachelor's. Though I'm just now starting taxes and final figures haven't come yet, between two jobs, l earned a bit more than 75K last year. My current FT  is a 5 yr contract gig with 3 yrs left on it. I never expected to earn this, but while I'm making it, I wanted my empolyers' matches (both employers match retirement funds in pre-tax money).  What I am just now realizing is what a mess this might leave me in with regard to my REPAYE plan. I first attempted school in the late 90's, but didn't finish due to borrowing limits. At the time, I was faxed with the choice of either borrowing privately or repaying the debt. Ever since, I've been on a roller coaster of repayment woes, but during this payment pause, I've paid ~21K on my one time high of 69K of srudent loan debt. The Dept of Ed says they're expecting recertification in June? Sept?, and I'm now concerned that I won't qualify. 

Since I recently decided to return to school, I've been trying to reshape my finances to suit a FAFSA.  Needless to say, my EFC needs work. But the school I've chosen is an in-state public one, so it's fairly affordable at ~ 2K per semester and I can basically afford to pay cash for a while. If there is one lesson I learned from the first time around , it's following the advice that school shouldn't cost more than I'm able to earn in 3-5 yrs.

I'm STEM, so my old classes are too old to receive credit for. I'm basically starting over, and I kind of need to make quick work of things, as my FT contract will end and put me back into the job market in 3 yrs. With that said, I've been in healthcare and am hopefully prepping for nursing school, so the transition will be brutal, but hopefully relatively brief.

I need these results to be FAFSA friendly. I may have elderly parents living with me at spme point, but I am a self supporting non traditional student.

Here's what I'm working with currently:

401K and 403B- about 50/50 Roth/before tax ~78K
Roth IRA -5K
529- new
Savings of various kinds ~ 15K 
Taxable brokerage (liquidating to move into 529)-9K


All the reading I've done recently about making a transition like this says that I basically need to spend down the cash, which includes an emergency fund, a new car fund and the like, which I'm basically not ready to do yet. I don't want to delay starting school for aforementioned reasons, but I need to ensure that as I cut back gradually from work, my income is moving in the right downward direction down and/or more ""Roth-like"" to avoid non qualified FAFSA income while my bills stay paid.

I also slowed down on student loan repayment now that at least I've paid almost all the capitalized interest I've accrued to date. Whenever interest restarts, hopefully I will have struck a decent balance between saving for a return to school in my 529 and dropping my amt owed to a decent level that I can pay while in school.

1. Is it true that I cannot have any money in any type of the IRAs including a rollover IRA, and the only way to do a backdoor while having money in the rollover is to a) covert it into a Roth or b) transfer into a 401k?
2. If I do convert a rollover into Roth, all the funds get moved over but I have to pay taxes from my savings account based on the income bracket at the time of conversion?
3. Once I convert rollover into a Roth, I can still contribute $6500 for 2023?
4. Do I have to accept the losses in the rollover at the time of conversion (eg. All my current rollover funds are in VTWAX this year which is down ~20%, if I wish to convert I have to sell them and take the loss)?

Was pre-approved for a loan with my wife. After a year of being out-offered on houses (about 15 offers on houses), we finally got an offer accepted. It seems like a blessing in disguise as it’s the area where we wanted to live in because the schooling is great for our daughter when she’s older.

Because it’s been so long finding a house, I slacked big time on preparing my bank statements for months…after reading on Reddit and google and what not, it seems lenders will deny me instantly for my bank statement alone because it’ll seem I spend way too much. But I hope they know it’s because we live at my parents and aren’t paying rent, so I’ve had extra money to spend (and also spent money on gambling that I shouldn’t have). But I figured as long as I pay my CC every month, it wouldn’t matter cause I’ll make back whatever I lose. (I’ve also deleted the gambling app the second I was approved) it was moreso my form of entertainment rather going to bars.

My DTI is 9%. My CC debt is like 300$ (which I can essentially pay off right now) and my car payment is like 300$ a month. I also pay 350$ on storage fees for our belongings (obviously that’ll end once we get into a home). I also have enough money for the down deposit, closing costs and a few months of mortgage payments in my savings.

I guess I’m just really worried about my bank statements with the spending this year living at my parents (November I gambled a bit too much, probably 2000$) and wondering if my DTI will save me, along with being on the loan with my wife? Or will they instantly deny me because of how many times I’ve gambled?

Basically the flight came in at 11am with my bag and they had no other flights that day, so staff was leaving at 12pm. I had to cancel new years day plans to meet this 11am-12pm window. I found my bag at the baggage claim today. I never saw an employee, otherwise I would've probably complained. I tried to see someone at the front desk, to no avail. Their phone number for the airport doesn't even work. 

I've talked to corporate customer service over a messenger app, as that is the only means of communication with this airline. They had me complete a form with receipts about items I bought because of the lost bag, as well as items in the bag. I haven't heard back in almost 1 week.

As far as they know, my bag could still be missing and/or stolen. I'm usually someone who plays by the rules, and my original plan was to only ask for reimbursement for the items I had to purchase for the 2 weeks my bag was missing, then just move on.

However, I'm tempted to use their bad customer service/bag tracking abilities against them. I'm just not sure how. What should I do? Insist that my bag is missing still? Maybe they will offer a greater refund. Being without my bag for 2 weeks and receiving near radio silence from the airline was very unsettling. That bag had food I made for my family in it (which is disgusting now). It had developed family photographs from 2008 I thought were gone for good. It had christmas gifts I had to replace. Sure, they will reimburse the things I repurchased, but what about the stress? What about requiring me to pick it up? What about the shitty, careless customer service? What about sending it to my 12/15 destination on 12/29, when I was already back home? To top it off, for a nonstop flight!

2700,personalfinance,"TL;DR: My job (travel nurse agency for this year) never contributed to my 401k. My paystubs say 401k and has 15% of each weekly check as the number, but it never went to any 401k. Just stayed in my check. What are my options?

Hey all,

I am a travel nurse and I am currently working for a travel agency that isn't ""based"" in the US. I say ""based"" because they have an office here, but it looks to be in some run down building based on google maps. All of the employees are indian and my recruiter seems to be based out of india based on the times she calls/texts me.

When signing up with the agency, under their benefits page it asked me how much I wanted to contribute to my 401k and I put in 15% of each check. Thought everything was done.

I checked my first check and saw 15% of my pay went to my 401k (there's a line item that says 401k plan - $_ _ _. _ _). I thought great. I don't tend to check my 401k and especially didn't want to this year d/t the volatility of it.

I logged into my account today and saw the total and was shocked at how it was. It was less than the last time I looked at the beginning of the year. I know, my fault for not checking.

But then I looked back at my checks and it seems that despite it saying money was placed in a 401k, it looks like it never went anywhere. My checks are the same size as if there was no 401k line item.

I work in different states with different rates so my checks are always fluctuating so I didn't really notice.

I have always been financially stable and chalk that up to my dad who has always advised me and to my own business degree. While I do have debt, I am actively paying it off. I do love to spend money and am not always the most conservative when it comes down to it. 

My boyfriend was not afforded the same education in finances as I was. It seems like he can’t stand to have $1 in his pocket. He has made big steps forward throughout our relationship and I commend him for that. 

Here’s my dilemma. A few years before we met, he burned his foot badly. I think he was around 22/23 yrs old. Badly enough to where he had to be taken to the nearest burn unit in SA, TX on an army base. (He is not in the armed forces, but that’s where it was). From what I’m told they had to sign a bunch of paperwork for him to be seen and he was in such pain that they just signed whatever so he could be seen. Come to find out he wasn’t on any sort of insurance. 

Now he has $25,000 of medical debt owed to the department of defense. 

He has called to talk with them about a plan and well they aren’t really accommodating to say the least. Our options were to pay in full, have a payment plan of $700/month (which we can’t afford), or (in his words) send them a check and hope it’s enough to settle. 

My first question is: would they really just tell us to send them a check in hopes it’ll be enough? Or did he misunderstand them? Bc it’s been a sore spot for a bit. 

Secondly: what are our options? I’ve tried looking into it but I can only get so far since we aren’t married.

It was a tough time for us with her having two surgeries (knee, kidney stones) and a high deductible health plan not being a whole lot of help. More than that, I finally got her to disclose to her parents that she had $24,000 in credit card debt, almost all accumulated before our 2021 marriage. It's no longer used.

We are expected to pay the loan back this month, but there was never any strict number attached to how much to pay per month. It was more like pay what you can.

The problem is that the loan, generous as it was, didn't really help a whole lot. It knocked the minimum credit card payment down $30/month, kind of like a drop in the bucket.

2715,personalfinance,"A few years ago I bought a $7,500 Subaru Outback as a broke college student with plans for it to last 5 years and then buy a Tacoma. Unfortunately, it's on its last legs 2 years earlier than planned.  I'm looking to get a car in the next couple months and would like some advice.

For background, I work as a remote software engineer in the mountains.  I don't drive the car much on a day to day basis other than groceries, going to the gym, etc.  However, I very frequently drive on rough roads for mountain biking, backcountry skiing, camping, desert climbing trips, etc.

Monthly budget:

* Monthly take home pay after max 401k for company match, taxes, etc:  $5800
* Rent + utilities + wifi: $1800
* Food: $300
* Gym + subscriptions: $100
* Random things that come up: $300-$400
* Everything else gets thrown in a HYSA while I build up emergency fund and savings for car

Financials:

* Credit score: 800
* \~4 month emergency fund
* $16,000 saved for a car down payment sitting in a HYSA

The problem is, I have \~$40,000 of student loans. $20k private at 4.2% and $20k federal at 4.4%. Since graduating a year ago, I've only paid \~$300 a month towards the private loans while building up an emergency fund and a little bit of savings. I haven't paid anything on the federal loans because they're all deferred and not accruing interest for now anyways.

My question is, what type of car should I get? The dream is a new Tacoma because it would allow me to do all the hobbies I like, they last forever, and they retain their value super well.  I'd have no problem keeping the car for the next 250,000+ miles. This would be roughly \~$40,000.  I thought about used ones, but they hold their value so well that used Tacomas are insanely expensive.

Another alternative is a new Subaru Outback for \~$32,0000. This would get me most of the way with my hobbies, but I know I would eventually want to upgrade for more off-roading capabilities and truck stuff. I'm not sure how much money I would be losing in the long term if I know that I'm going to want to upgrade in the relatively near future anyways.

3rd alternative would be buying a used beater Outback or something similar with all cash. My concern with this is that while it is getting better, the used car market is still ridiculous.  I'm still scarred from dumping money on maintenance into my current car only for it to die in a couple years while also not letting me go all the places I want to go.  Plus, there are huge maintenance costs that tend to pop up around 100k miles (head gaskets, etc).

What are your thoughts? Am I ridiculous and in need of a reality check for even considering a new Tacoma right now with my loans? Is there another alternative I haven't considered? Thanks!",New vs used vs beater car w/ student loans. How much should I spend?,1672601687

I know the returns won’t be anything special, but they will probably be better than just keeping it all in savings. 

So far, the options I have seen are HYSA, CDs, and T-Bills. Since I have a few months, I was eyeing the 13 week T-Bills as a safe investment that have a decent yield currently (Vanguard lists the APY as 4.4%). My thought process being I put in maybe $35k of the $46k I have saved into the bills for that 13-week period and get whatever return I can while still keeping my investment very safe. My question basically is am I thinking over this enough? I was keeping around $10k related to this student loans savings in case something bad were to happen. Is that really possible or should I still feel comfortable putting that entire amount in T-Bills? Or should I be using a different investment vehicle entirely?

2731,personalfinance,"Hi all - I'm new to investing and just screwed up my first backdoor Roth IRA conversion. Early in December 2022, I made a traditional IRA, contributed $6000 of after-tax money, and rolled it all over to my Roth IRA while telling Fidelity to close the traditional IRA. Today I logged in and noticed the traditional IRA was back with about $7 of funds from dividends paid out on December 30th. Now I'm worried about the pro-rata rule (which I don't understand) and don't know what to do with that $7 of dividends since it's now 2023.

2747,personalfinance,"Hey all,  


I'm 26 and I'm seeking to retire as soon as possible in a relatively safe way.  


I'm making $56,000 a year, but if you factor my employer contributions for retirement, I make $61,160. My employer puts 10% of my salary towards my retirement plan and I put an additional 5% out of my base $56,000 a year towards my retirement. As of last month, I have nearly 8k in my retirement account, but it constantly loses value, it's a target date 2060 fund ( FDKLX).   


Outside of the 15% contribution of my salary, I've started putting roughly 1k out of my 3080 net home pay per month (I only get 12 paychecks a year), towards an index fund that tracks the S &amp; P 500 (SWPPX) and I've been able to do this 2 months in a row, to about 2k.   


I've got a home valued at $123,000 (yes, that's the actual taxed value) with a $41,300 mortgage on it with a payoff in 2039. I've got a $13,100 personal loan that is paid off in 2028. I've also got 4k in credit card debt. No student loans or car loans. The minimums for all debt is about 850 a month.  


the 13,100 personal loan was for home repairs (new roof, foundation fixing, new HVAC system, replacing extensive water damage in bathroom and utility room resulting in a complete gutting). It was used in combination with my credit card and personal savings.   


I still need to replace the sewer line (roughly 6k), replace the garage roof (unknown estimate at this time), and get electrical up to code (roughly 5k) in the next 5-7 years.   


I am relatively healthy and I do my own car work and I drive a 21 year old car (almost 22), taxes are dirt cheap (like 20 bucks a year cheap), and insurance is also cheap for it. When this car fails, I will buy another older car and work on it. I've been using this car for about 4 years and put in about 3k to get it working/street legal to drive.  


I have a long term partner who lives with me and earns about 31k a year. They contribute about $350 a month towards utilities and pitch in sometimes for food. They spend much more than me on debt compared to income/assets:  
4k in medical debt, roughly 11k in student loan debt.  


The average income per capita in my area is only about 35k and household is around 50k average and my household earns about $87,000 with a total household debt of about $73,400.  


1: I have a bachelor's degree and have completed 4/10 classes for my master's. My bachelor's was in social sciences and my master's is going to be in cybersecurity. I currently work in I.T. involving project management, database admin, and dev work in higher education. I take about 1-2 classes a year, then a break. This is to avoid student debt.   


Should I rush this more? I can tackle the subject very well (I have a 4.0), but each class is about 2.5k.  


2: My target date retirement fund is always losing money. I try not to look at day to day performance of an fund, but I am getting antsy with this. I know the idea is that riskier investments earlier in the fund pay off later towards 2060, but I don't know to gauge the performance.  


3: Roughly 1/3rd of my net income goes to investing, 1/3rd to paying debt, the remainder is split between cost of living (food, gas, bills) and savings (usually to put into the house).   


Is this acceptable? So far it it has worked with me. There was a period of time (2020 to mid 2022) where I was putting nearly all my income towards the house. Thankfully it's safer now.  


4: I'd like to retire in my 50s, does this seem possible?  


5: I'd like to possible get a 2nd stream of income, but I don't want to make my life miserable. I've been looking into doing work for a cyber tech startup, but it's a demanding field. A lot of higher paying jobs want me to have certificates that I struggle or earn, or more experience (I've only got a year of exp in this field).

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

Which path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?

The two of them agreed to split that evenly down the road (at the time, the boyfriend did not have enough to cover his half). As time goes, the boyfriend made purchases towards major appliances for the home, totaling $X. His initial thought was that his $5k portion he owed his girlfriend for the down payment would be reduced by $X.

New person to Reddit here after some help…

27(M) with a child living in England in a 2 bed house at current. 

After spending my earlier years not understand or caring to understand money, racking up lots of credit card &amp; loan debts and some remortgaged. I’ve got myself into a much better financial situation. Heading into 2023 with a clean slate with no debt apart from mortgage &amp; sub accounts although some of that was debt. 

Reading ‘how to own the world’ by Andrew Craig was a great insight and awakening for how little I knew how about the game of money. 

So….

SET UP - 

Income after tax/NI  - £2500
Average income with overtime after tax/NI- £2800

Bills - 
£1250-1500 (depending on 4/5week month) 
Spending money (£500, £125pw)  paid into a Separate Monzo spending account. 

Mortgage (37 years 5 months) -
Sub account 1 - £91,923.93 @ 2.44%
Sub account 2 - £14,357.85 @ 2.44%
Sub account 3 - £14,625.92 @ 2.44%
Sub account 4 - £17,284.69 @ 2.69 % 

Planned to overpay mortgage by £100pm starting off with sub account 4. I did think about putting this into a savings account with higher interest but with the interest calculated daily I assume it’s better off to pay it direct?

3). Any advice on to mortgage situation.

2. Because I just set this up, I will contribute for 2022 ($6000) and for 2023 ($6500 as a new max).  Is my understanding correct that a correct course of action should be:

2786,personalfinance,"Before people  say 6 months worth of emergency expenses, because I understand that is the general rule, I'm asking as a way to maximize my savings and am looking for another viewpoint or perspective as I'm not always right. Below is my background. This is going to be long and if you do read to the end, I appreciate that. I'm a 26 year old whose parents were excellent at budgeting and saving but not so much at making their money work for them, which is something I am trying to learn more about.  I am also married but my husband and I keep our finances separate as we have different views and emotions regarding money. 

I currently making $4,400 take home from the Navy and just got a part time job that will pay anywhere from $500-800/month take home. I have zero intention of spending the extra money from the part time job and it will all go to a HYSA. 

I currently have $12,000 in my savings account that accrues about $9/month. Not a lot of money but it's something. I am expecting to get a payment of $17,00 this year in July which plays into factor for some of my options. The $17,000 is not a re-enlistment bonus, it's funds from college fund that will be paid to me once I finish my Bachelor's degree so I don't think I will be taxed on it, but I could be wrong. 

I think it's also worth noting that I have a car payment of 500/month; I pay an extra $200/month on it to pay down the principal(4.49% interest). 35% of my loan is paid off, I currently owe $19,000 and I am hoping to get it under $10,000  by the end of this year. My monthly expenses for the mortgage, utilizes, and pet care totals $1,200 a month as well. I save $300/month but that number should go up with the new side job. 

I leave myself about $1,600-$1,800/month for gas, groceries, gifts, pets, normal daily expenses.

I also keep a sinking funds, right now I am at $1,000 and my goal is to have $2,500 in it before July. Lastly, because I'm trying to cover bases on where my money goes, I put $200 into the stock market every month and $150 into my TSP, which I never see but I added it so people don't think I'm choosing to overlook retirement in its entirety.

I am looking into opening a CD with Navy Fed as it earns 4.30% APY. The only downside is the money will be locked in for a year. I am also considering opening a HYSA with American Express(3.30% APY). I currently have two credit cards with them and think they have great customer service. I have made a pay chart with showing my options in terms of amount for each based on what I put into it, as well as the interest accrued within a year. Also, if I did the calculations wrong feel free to correct them in the comments. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for advice on a lot of things, I will summarize them because I know this was long. If you read this far, I really appreciate it. I know a lot of you have more knowledge and experience in this. I can't ask my parents, their strength lies in their budgeting skills and I have gotten a lot of help on budgeting from them. 

1. How much money should I actually keep on hand? I get paid regardless of what happens to me so the six month rule does not seem the best ""fit"" for me right now. 
2. Should I put more money in my CD? I am pretty risk averse and feel comfortable putting $5,000-$7,000 in a certificate. However, I feel a little more comfortable with the money I'll be getting this year between my college fund and side job funds. 
3. Not a question but if anyone has any HYSA's they'd like to recommend, I am open to it and feel free to leave them in the comments
4. Am I spending too much a month? I know that is a lot for people but I enjoy eating out and buying things for my pets. It makes me happy and I don't feel I'm going broke because of it. 
5. If you feel comfortable answering, what would you do in this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

If you got to the end and read everything, thank you! I appreciate the help and perspective!!! Happy New Years!

I really need your help. 

I took out a loan back in 2019 and paid it off by the scheduled time in 2020. I never missed a payment and received a letter saying my balance for the loan was at £0 meaning I had nothing left to pay off. 

COVID completely destroyed my family. My dad was incredibly vulnerable due to a whole list of health problems and legally needed 24 hour care so we we went into our own personal bubble from March 2020 until 2022. Unfortunately he had to be hospitalised in April 2022 and whilst in the hospital caught COVID, which killed him. 

Me and my mum were his full time carers over the 2 years of COVID so as you can imagine things have been pretty rough. I had no need to check my credit score until late 2022 where I found out that I’d apparently not paid off the loan and had an outstanding amount which was unpaid for TWO YEARS. 

My credit score is ruined. It was really good before this as I’d taken out loans to build it up and always paid them off. I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to finances and I haven’t found the courage to ring them yet.  

Is this something they can fix? I looked back on my bank statements and there was one month where the payment was reversed due to my bank account not having the funds, but I knew that at the time so immediately put the funds into the account and then it was taken afterwards.

The biggest thing for me is I received the letter confirming it was paid off, and have had no correspondence to say otherwise since.

I know I need to ring them but I’d love to hear what you think the outcome is going to be, so I don’t walk into that phone call with my hopes up and get crushed. I’m going to university this year and I’m worried I won’t be able to get accommodation with how bad my credit score is now, if any landlords require a credit check.

First off, many sources discussing Massachusetts suggest that ‘Marital property refers to all property, rights, and assets acquired during the course of the marriage, regardless of which spouse actually acquired them. ‘

However, Massachusetts, also is a common law state. I read that ‘Under a common-law property system, each spouse is considered a separate individual entitled to their own property. That means any income earned and property acquired is owned by whichever spouse’s name is on the check or property title.’

I have been saving money since 2008. For my purposes. I wanted to go to study in Japan. Passed the JLPT (Japanese-Language Proficiency Test). In 2014, I almost raised the necessary amount. But then the ruble collapsed. ( Crimea ).

I was completely broken. But thanks to my students. Looking at them, I came out of depression.

I currently work three jobs:

1. Teaching children animation and comics (200 $/m)
2.  I work for a TV company as a video editor (100$/m)
3. In the morning I work as a janitor (50 $/m)

With the help of friends in Ukraine and Moldova, I open a new store with prints. Before all this hell, he brought me 15-300 $/m. I hope to get at least half of it. 

Monetization on YouTube has been disabled. Before that, it brought 30-150 $/m.

Students from abroad cannot study with me now. Before all this, 200-500 $/m.

The roadmap looks something like this:

1. Restore what I can.
2. Move to a visa-free country.
3. Try to access my paypal.
4. Moving to Japan.

In her other job, she hasn’t been checking her paystubs in a while (between 2 jobs and us starting our own business she just never got around to it) and yesterday looked at one.

What she found was that, without her knowledge, she was signed up for the companies 401k program, and they’ve been taking money for it for several months.

Her employer doesn’t have an explanation, other than that she should have been receiving emails about it. We searched, but found no emails regarding the 401k.

She is a little over $3000 over the yearly limit because of this, and the employer says it will cost us $195 to get the money back.

My opinion is that as she never signed up for it (the employer thinks the person entering her information when she started accidentally entered it) that she should be able to get the money back without paying anything.

To be clear, the employer has admitted that she never signed up for it. They feel she should have noticed it earlier, and I’m guessing that this is why they want her to pay the $195. However, that’s a standard amount, regardless of how much was contributed, so the $195 would be the same charge even if she noticed it the first time.

I have been looking for this answer, but can't seem to find it, so I hope someone is able to help...

If I have a 13-week treasury bill (held at treasurydirect.gov) that is maturing on 4/6/2023 and I want to convert that bill to a 26-week treasury bill after maturity, how do I go about doing this on treasurydirect.gov?

Is it possible to place a buy/bid on the 4/3/2023 auction date and then depend on the cash being available from the matured t-bill on the 6/4/2023 settlement/maturity date?

If not, does that mean the cash from the matured t-bill has to sit for a week before I can use it to buy the new 26-week t-bill at the following weeks auction?

If it is possible to buy the new 26-week t-bill in the same week as the old 13-week t-bill matures, do I have to make sure that the ""Maturity Payment Destination"" is ""Zero-Percent C of I"" and not a bank account?  Would I then also have to make sure the order for the 26-week t-bill has ""Zero-Percent C of I"" as the ""Source of funds""?  Any other thing I have to do to make sure it works?

Perhaps I am going about this the wrong way and there is, perhaps, some other way to do this more gracefully?

For the C1 card I use YNAB to track my regular spending and pay off whatever I’ve currently spent in the month which is typically more than what they’ve calculated as the minimum payment due. I’m still left with a pretty high balance (hence my current debt payoff journey). When I make the payment on current spending it gives me the option to cancel the upcoming auto pay for the minimum due. I typically choose to cancel the auto pay if my payment will exceed the minimum due. Is that the correct way to treat the minimum payment or should I be making payments for current spending + accrued interest + minimum payment amount? Or do I cancel the minimum payment auto pay, and apply that amount to the other card balance I’m trying to pay off first? Is there a reason I should still make the minimum payment on the C1 card in addition to payments for current spending and accrued interest? Thanks.",WWYD - credit card minimum payment help,1672534914

I was just relocated two states over and start my new position on Tuesday. Due to circumstances out of my control, I was only able to move into my new apartment on Dec 31.  My new lease started on Dec 30.

2876,personalfinance,"I really need some advice on taking over my parent's mortgage for a while. Currently they do not bring in a lot of income and since I have a stable one, I have decided to take over their mortgage to help them out. However, there are a lot of moving parts and I saw some ""disturbing"" things with their mortgage. 

They owe about \~200k in principal, but so far this year, only \~4k of that balance is paid off and instead 7.3k on interest and 8.5k on taxes. So it seems like they are barely touching their balance. In fact, they took out a loan of 216k back in 2006 and their current principal is still 200k. I'm wondering if this is even worth paying off or we should just sell the house and move into a smaller home where the finance is much more reasonable, manageable, and doable. I would love for them to not worry about debt since they're old.

They (now I) pay 1.6k/month and the breakdown is, they pay 300 in principal, 550 on interest and 750 on escrow. Did they get screwed over on this loan? What can I do to better their financial situation when it comes to this home? And lastly, what are the tax implications for me taking over my parent's mortgage?

Anyway, I have a bunch credit card debt that's slowly been racking up over the years. Last year I wanted to get serious about paying it off so I applied for a Happy Money consolidation loan. I'm a big stupid moron so I only put about half of my debt (the cards with the highest interest rate) on it to ""try it"", not realizing that you can't add to this loan later. I love Happy Money and I wish I'd just put all of my debt on that at once. Boo.

Now I basically have this massive Happy Money account and then 3 other smaller credit cards, all totaling about $27k. About two months ago I learned about Accredited  Debt Relief and I was like ""oh that sounds cool"". I did a bit of research and they have good reviews, so I thought why not. All of my credit cards and the Happy Money loan qualified, so I thought this would be a good option.

The first thing they tell you to do is stop paying your credit card/loan bills, so I've done that. This is where I'm kinda getting cold feet. I really hate not paying my bills and watching my credit score drop. I've been getting calls and letters and it stresses me out. I've heard that the best thing to do is just trust the program but I'm still nervous.

I've also recently received a letter from Best Egg in the main for a pre-approved personal loan at 8.99% APR that would cover up to $50k. So...should I abandon ship with Accredited Debt Relief, get this other loan, and pay off all my stuff with this?!?! Or at least pull out 3/4 of the qualifying cards/loans from A.D.R. (one of the loans looks like it might reach a settlement soon). Previously I was having trouble getting approved for another debt consolidation loan because I'd applied for the Happy Money one too recently...I'm just nervous and in over my head and I feel like I'm making a bad situation worse lol.

I've been looking into investing and retirement plans for a few months but everything is still so confusing to me. I'm getting a headache reading 20 different answers and all these options and IRA's and everything. I hope this subreddit could give me some advice and answer some questions I have. I'm new to all this and I haven't placed any money anywhere yet.

&amp;#x200B;

So I opened an account with Betterment, since I saw good reviews for them. I was going to use them to save up for a trip to see my bf in December, save some money to help my parents when they're older, and then one for general investing in the future. Like for a house, new car, etc. I've looked at their IRA's for retirement and I have no idea what I'm looking at even though it's been explained to me 20 times. My employer doesn't have a 401k plan (that I've been told of, I'll ask her tomorrow), so I heard it's best in that case to open an IRA account. Is that true? And if so, my bank (Regions) has investing options as well, could I use my bank? Is it better to use my bank or something like Betterment?

Now, I don't bring a lot of money in monthly. Most of it goes to bills, and paying my car monthly, and helping my family out, so I didn't want to put in a lot but just little by little to get me started. For Betterment I was thinking of putting $5 in to each account bi-weekly. Would that be a good start?

2926,personalfinance,"So, there are three parties involved in this situation:

1. My husband, the employee
2. Mr. Blank's Business, Inc., my husband's employer (which pays him a biweekly paycheck)
3. Mrs. Someone's LLC, which has a contract with Mr. Blank's Business for the completion of a project and pays Blank's business directly for time, materials, etc.

Mrs. Someone gave us a check as a Christmas gift, but that check is not from her personal bank account, it's from her LLC's bank account.

Since Mrs. Someone's LLC isn't my husband's employer, but my husband's employer's employer, is that check considered a gift (and therefore not taxable income, at least not for the recipient) or a bonus (and thus considered taxable income)?

This is especially important to us as we've received the APTC subsidy for our monthly health insurance premiums this year and this check would put us above our estimated income for 2022, therefore requiring us to make repayments.

From what I've gleaned from internet research, gift tax is payed by the gift giver unless the gift recipient agrees to pay it instead, and neither party have to pay it unless it equals or exceeds the amount of the annual gift tax exclusion ($16000 in 2022), which in this case it does not.

Am I right in concluding that this counts as a gift, not income, despite being given by a business?

Does  the capital gains tax rate work like income tax - you pay a given rate  for all income within each rate threshold - OR is it the case that as  soon as your income crosses the earning threshold, you pay capital gains  taxes on *all* of your capital gains (even those below the income threshold for that rate)?

Here's an example to clarify:

In  2022, the capital gains tax rate is 0% until a single filer earns  $41,676 at which point is shifts to a 15% capital gains tax rate. Let's  say I earn $40,000, and I have capital gains of $2,000. Would I have to  pay the 15% capital gains tax on *all $2000*  of my capital gains, or would I pay 0% on $1,676 of my capital gains,  and only pay 15% on the $324 in capital gains that pushes me over the  $41676 income threshold?

Marcus by Goldman Sachs
- 3.3% APY
- large institution that I have positive experiences with already 
- funds available same day if need be
- fabulous UX (I work in UX so that’s important to me)

SalemFive Direct
- 4.1% APY
- small bank in Salem, MA that I’ve never worked with before (hence my anxiety about utilizing them as my emergency fund)
- funds are slow to transfer if in a pinch and they don’t even have an app

So really for me it’s a question of which route is better for me…I feel way more comfortable with GS but that 4.1% SalemFive offers is tempting. I tend to be risk averse to a fault so I’m trying to gauge what’s worth taking a little more risk here. Btw, they’re both FDIC insured.

2943,personalfinance,"I'm curious how folks here process saving for college and balancing out giving children options/risks of over-saving/valuing private colleges.  My partner and I are fortunate to have a good, steady income and are currently maxing out our tax-protected retirement accounts.  Both of us were also lucky enough to graduate college without any significant debt (one of us did four years at a private college, the other did 2 years private/2 years public) thanks to parental support.  On one hand, we want to give our children the same opportunities but on the other hand, looking at projected costs it's hard to fathom that a private school is providing adequate value for the cost difference.

I've put together a projection in excel to help us plan for our 529.  If our kids follow the standard timeline (i.e. no gap years), they'd be entering school in Fall of '29 and Fall of '31.  

By my projections the future value for four years of private school would be around $440K (1st child) and $465K (2nd child) while public school would be around $160K/$170K.  If we were to fully fund each child's 529 to plan for private school and they attended public school instead, each of the 529s would be left with over $325K after graduation.

Obviously there are options for that leftover money including graduate school, rolling it over into their own children's (or other relative's) 529s, and now rolling it into Roth's, but on the other hand, $650K is a significant chunk of change to wrap up in an account where non-qualified withdrawals are penalized.

Anyway, I'm not exactly asking ""what should I do"" because I realize this is about personal values more than anything else, but I am curious - how have other people processed making this decision?",Saving for College - Private vs Public,1672515585

2947,personalfinance,"I have been managing my elderly mother-in-law’s finances for a year now, after her husband passed away. He did the majority of the bill paying so I took over the job to help her out. They had no savings and were both reliant on social security as their sole income. With his passing, she now only makes about $950 from social security each month.

She drains her bank account to zero whenever the social security payment hits each month and barely squeaks by. For Christmas, she decided to buy us and several family members gifts from the Montgomery Ward catalog using their credit. My mother in law is a very nice woman, but I guarantee she was lured in with a “Buy Now, Pay Later” scheme without thinking through the details of interest rates, etc.

Since we manage her finances, we asked to see the bill so we could get it paid for her and balance her monthly budget. She charged nearly 500 dollars to this credit account. She also did not hand over the info until we asked and she already missed this month’s payment due date. Apparently they want her to pay 25 a month plus 25.99% interest for the next 17 months or so. Honestly, her budget is down to zero each month- she cannot even afford the 25 a month. 

I would imagine the bill goes to collections eventually if she doesn’t pay. (I am pretty clueless with this as I have never carried a balance on a card or anything like that) Can a collection agency garnish her social security?

She claims she did not provide her bank account/debit card info when applying for the credit but not sure what to believe- she will fib to us sometimes.

In early 2020 I bought a condo for $172K when I was 24, jointly with my dad in order to qualify (I had the income to make all the payments, just not the income history or down payment).

At this point, I feel like I'm financially solid--I'm well on my way to building out my retirement and foundation--but I'm definitely not as affluent as I could be if I just stayed in one place and worked constantly.

* Mid 20s, single w/ no dependents

* 120k salary (technically also have 12k bonus and 100k in RSUs vesting over next 4 years, but I haven't been at this company long enough to know how consistently this bonus will pay out in full, and the stock has historically not been a very strong performer so it could be next to nothing by the time it actually vests. Thus I'm not comfortable counting them when budgeting).

* I take home 2.5k biweekly after maxing 401k and HSA contributions.

* No major debts except monthly CC statement, which is generally somewhere between $1k-1.5k each month.

* Current rent is $2k and that's pretty comfortable I feel. I think I could realistically pay more like 2.5k for housing. Maaaaybe 3k? (but that might involve cutting down savings being put into markets, let me know if this is a terrible idea)

* Currently have about 100k in index funds, adding 1k biweekly so hoping it will be larger than that when it comes time to buy.

2971,personalfinance,"I'm new to investing, I've been doing so for roughly half a year. My goal is to invest in stocks that pay dividends and continuously re-invest those dividends back into more shares over the roughly 30 stocks I have shares in. I've created a strategy which I believe will let me increase my dividends slightly faster but I'd like to share here and confirm.

Every 2 weeks, I make my investments, combining a fixed amount from my paycheck with whatever dividends I've received in the previous 2 weeks. My strategy is to heavily favor buying shares in stocks where the ex-date will occur within the next 2 weeks. My reasoning is that I will see a slight return from that investment pretty soon in the form of dividends paid out by that stock within the next month or so. As I keep doing this, I'll be compounding dividends faster.

I believe this is valid because of this thought experiment: let's say I have 4 stocks which pay once per year. Each stock pays dividends in a different quarter: stock A for Q1 up to stock D for Q4. Each pays 4% dividend. I'll have $100 each quarter to invest.

* If I invest $100 in each quarter all into stock D, I'll have $400 in stock D and have a total value of $416.
* If I invest $100 in each stock at each quarter, I'll have:
   * $100 in A, which yields $4
   * $104 in B, which yields $4.16
   * $108.16 in C, which yields $4.3264 (I'm not sure how the rounding would actually work but here I'll use fractional cents)
   * $112.4864 in D, which yields $4.499456

- I started job 2 on 9/26/22, and lo and behold, it’s the same HR company, so I reactivate my FSA account with only 4 days left in the coverage year (literally the same login).

- On 10/1/22 I elect another $2,000 for 2022-2023 for job 2.

- On 12/8 I finally get the bill for my daughters birth.

- I try using the $2,000 funds on 12/18

- The $2000 was pulled from 22-23 automatically because the HR company switches default years on 12/15, even though I have until 1/31/2023 to submit.

2982,personalfinance,"TLDR: Federal Debt Relief Program experiences (good/bad) should I stay with the program and trust them or is there a better option?

Just recently started the Federal Debt Relief program a couple of days ago to take care of my $28,000 unsecured debts and now having second thoughts about it. 

I am worried about the possible lawsuits that might incur and just them not reaching an agreement with my creditors and then I'm just left to deal with the consequences with even higher payments.

Just wondering if anyone has gone through this program and has seen any success or if there is a better option for me. Currently making ends meet paycheck to paycheck.

My first deposit in this program isn't until Jan 12th so I hope I still have time to cancel if this program will backfire on me. Just seeing these reviews on them makes me not want to start it. 

I tried to cancel yesterday but was talked out of it by one of their agents, after doing more research I'm just not sure if I want to stay with this or not.

Again just curious if anyone has done the Federal Debt Relief Program, what your experiences were if it was successful or not, and if there is a better alternative for my debt.

2983,personalfinance,"I recently retired from 27 years in a public school system (speech language pathologist).  I will now be providing part-time/short-term speech services to public schools as a W9 employee - covering maternity leaves and LOAs, covering caseloads until they find a permanent SLP, etc.  The demand for this type of niche service is pretty big and I'm not too worried about getting gigs, except possibly during the summer - I guess we'll see how that pans out.  

(For reference, when I decided this was what I wanted to do i sent a mail merge to all the special ed directors in two counties.  I sent the email at 12:53 pm and by 1:10 pm was booked Monday through Thursday at two different school districts through the end of the school year.  I have a third district who might be interested in Fridays, but I was kind of hoping to keep Fridays free.)

Anyway, I've never done anything like ths before, and I'm afraid I'll screw up my finances.  I'd appreciate help/advice in making sure I have all my bases covered. 

I already have health coverage from my pension, so I don't need to worry about that. I also have professional liability insurance.

To start, my rates are $85/hour and so far both jobs are 7 hour days - so that's $595 per day, $2380 per week.  I think I need to save about 30% for taxes, right?  So that's saving about $715 and banking about $1665 per week?

For taxes, I think I have to pay estimated taxes, but I'm not sure exactly what/how to do that. When I used the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator, it asked if I have a ""job that regularly withholds federal income taxes from your paychecks.""  I said no because nothing is withheld from my check when I get paid, and the tool said that I can't use it.  :-(  It seems like it's only for W4 jobs?

When I do my tax returns, I can claim business expenses now, right?  For instance, I bought my own evaluation kits for $2100, so I can claim those on my tax return?  Can I claimm the laptop I bought this year if I am using it for work? (In the fall I contracted just one day per week at a school district and bought the laptop to use there.)

Finally, for taxes, is it based on when you did the work, or when you got the money?  Example:  I worked in December for $3600, but won't get paid for that until January.  That still goes on this year's taxes, right?

I also now have to consider that I only get paid on days that I work, so holidays and sick days will affect my paycheck.  I feel like I should set up my own PTO fund so that I don't panic if there's a snow day or if I'm sick.  How do I determine what is an appropriate amount - based off my last job it seems like $550/month is reasonable?

Should I open separate checking/savings accounts to deposit my paychecks in and buy materials/supplies from and then basically pay myself from those accounts, or is it fine to just use my existing personal accounts for everything?

I feel like there are probably tons of things I haven't thought of, or that I'm doing wrong.  Any advice is apprciated!

2984,personalfinance,"So I’m currently 17 years old, and I was recently accepted into a university early decision. I looked onto my college’s website, and I found out that my tuition will be about $80k a year (including housing + meals), and I assume my family will spend money to bring me home when school is out. I had several conversations with my mother about how exactly I will pay for school, and she said that the majority of my tuition will be payed through a trust fund that my father left me before he passed away.
For most of my life, I chose not to ask my mother about the trust because I always heard her complain about how the long court battle she had trying to uphold the clause of her divorce agreement saying that if either she or my dad were to pass away before I was 18, they would leave all their money to me, but my father instead tried to leave *some* money to his friends and establish his lawyer friend as my trustee. Apparently, the fight got pretty nasty, and even though my mother was named a trustee by a judge later on, my dad’s lawyer friend used money from my trust fund to pay for his defense in the lawsuit. My mom also objected to paying someone to manage my stocks and bonds while we have family who are very successful hedge fund workers.
After sitting down with my mom, I discovered that my trust fund is currently worth about $1.4 million in various stocks and bonds. The fund was set up about 3-4 years ago at around $1.1 million, and it has paid my $40-45k tuition at private school since then, and I guess it makes sense that its still gaining money if the annual return for this year was about 5.3% or $72k. I did see that the fund was worth about $1.8 million a year ago, but my hedge fund friend explained that some stocks have gone down in the past year, and they will for a bit in the future. The fund, however, is still where it was 2 years ago, and that’s after my mom took out $150-$200k to pay for expenses.
My real question is what should I expect the next “changes” to my trust to look like, because even though my mother told me it will dissolve and ownership will be mine at around age 23, the trust was set up entirely for EDUCATION. Based on the way my mom talked about it, she didn’t expect me to have much of anything left by the time I finish college (and possibly grad school) since my trust has fluctuated a bit. I still thought that if I can generate $72k a year from the trust, and combine it with the $30-40k from my Mom’s 529, I wouldn’t see much of a change compared to now, and I could have $1 million by the time I’m 23.

I am currently making **$4400/month** after taxes (including health/vision/dental premiums, and contributing 3% to my company offered 401k plan.). I live in a HCOL. 

Within the next year, I am expecting a pay raise of $10-15k/year, with high probably of reaching $120k+/year in the next 5-7 years. I work in a field that is very minimally affected by a potential recession.

**Retirement - 401k balance is \~$7,000.** I am 26 for reference on how close I am to retirement.

Total combined 401k balance is **\~$7,000.** I am 26 for reference how close I am to retirement. 

**Monthly expenses (minimums): $2,171**

* No rent/housing expenses as I live at home, but I pay the electric bill as an agreement - **\~$300**(taking the average through the year)
* Student loan minimum - $**225**
* Other debt minimums (including car, CCs, and installment plans) - $**1041** (lowering to $800 by March 2023)
* Other expenses(phone, car insurance, etc): $**605**

Did not include things like groceries, gas, and other misc. expenses in this, as it is easier to reduce how much I am spending and there are no minimums.

-I currently have around $6,600 in my checking account. (Used to have more sitting there for longer and I still have no savings account haha but that’s another story) I would like to invest it somewhere.

-Credit score is 706 and recently got a credit card to start building more credit. (Good student loan history helped my credit I think)

-I was working recently when I was away from home for awhile but due to bad budgeting/spending I spent all the money I made and more. Also no 401K currently. 

-I have no car (this will be my first purchase to work towards)

-I have no job but I’m looking for a part/full time wfh job; if I’m able to get one soon it should bring in around 23-29k before taxes. (Parent’s schedule makes it’s hard for me to use one of the cars for in person work) 

-Monthly expenses $100-200. (These are medical related with a couple small subscriptions thrown in also the occasional food order)

-I’m grateful to have a good relationship with my parents so I don’t pay rent, and will be on my parent’s insurance till 26 or later. (I pull my weight with chores, meals, and wherever else I’m needed)

-I’m currently in school online. I’m halfway through but won’t be starting back classes till summer/fall semester. (I’m still doing school related studies though)

-When I graduate, hopefully around 24-25, I should only have 10-15k in loans to pay back. But there’s also a chance I will graduate debt free.
